                <p>Scholars and practitioners of the digital humanities generally recognize the
                    importance of solid project management and oversight. But coursework and
                    publications related to DH project management tend to focus heavily on the
                    difficulties of planning and launching a new project rather than the challenges
                    of maintaining an established one. Meanwhile, online advice for would-be
                    managers is couched in the language of "tips and tricks" or "steps for
                    beginners". Together these phenomena downplay the professional skills needed to
                    successfully manage a project while suggesting that project management is
                    necessary only in the beginning stages of an endeavor. They may even give the
                    impression that scholarship in the digital humanities is inherently ephemeral.
                    Through a case study of project management practices at the William Blake
                    Archive, which began publishing electronic scholarly editions in 1996, this
                    essay details the challenges and rewards of managing an established digital
                    humanities project. Managers of mature projects may be called upon to oversee
                    expansions in scope and mission, research and recommend new features and tools,
                    grow or shrink the number of project staff, seek out alternate sources of
                    support when early grants run out, maintain continuity as collaborators join and
                    leave the project, and develop new workflows and procedures to reflect these and
                    other changes.</p>

                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">When project management principles are made explicit among digital humanists,
                    they are often presented with little project-specific grounding and usually from
                    a beginner’s perspective. At THATCamp sessions, summer institutes, and other
                    meetings of scholars working in or intrigued by the digital humanities,
                    audiences are offered "basic principles,"
                    "tips and tricks," or "top-ten lists" that give the impression that
                    project management is a) simple and b) primarily a problem at the early stages
                    of a project. Most of the roundtables, seminars, forums, and blog posts devoted
                    to digital humanities project management, such as Bethany Nowviskie’s "Ten Rules for Humanities Scholars New to Project
                        Management," Brian Croxall’s "12 Basic Principles
                        of Project Management," and Sharon M. Leon’s more extensive "Project Management for Humanists," are concerned with
                    how to plan and launch a new project rather than how to guide an ongoing one.
                    The various "PM boot camps" that appear on the programs of THATCamps and DH
                    conferences (or traditional humanities conferences hoping to attract a DH crowd)
                    also usually operate on the assumption that participants are launching new
                    projects and that they bring to the table little or no prior project management
                        experience.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e195">[1]</a> Even intensive seminars like those offered at various
                    summer and winter institutes tend to focus heavily on project planning rather
                    than project management.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e204">[2]</a> Meanwhile, scholars and
                    collaborators involved in ongoing DH endeavors find that many of the questions
                    raised by these articles and seminars have long since been answered, while the
                    challenges of managing a project that is well past the planning stages go
                    largely undiscussed.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">While these "just for beginners" offerings perhaps reflect the recent surge
                    in attention and popularity experienced by the digital humanities — many
                    scholars are newly interested in launching digital humanities projects and will
                    need at least rudimentary management skills in order to do so — they can also
                    give the mistaken impression that digital humanities projects are inherently
                    disposable: that long-term project management is unnecessary because creating a
                    project is more important than developing or sustaining it. This impression, in
                    turn, contributes to the phenomenon that Nowviskie has characterized as the
                        "Eternal September" of the digital humanities:
                    the sense among those just coming to DH that "all of this is
                        new and… that the current scene is all there is"
               [<a class="ref" href="#nowviskie2012">Nowviskie 2012a</a>]. But funding agencies that support digital
                    humanities scholarship appear to be moving away from models based on project
                    proliferation and ephemerality and toward an emphasis on preservation and
                    permanence — at least of data, if not of entire projects.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e221">[3]</a>
                    The NEH Office of Digital Humanities’ decision to require a data management plan
                    from all potential grantees, for instance, will likely encourage scholars
                    building digital projects to consider more deeply the eventual fate of their
                        work.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e231">[4]</a> While not every project needs to last forever, some funding
                    agencies may soon begin insisting on the long-term sustainability of projects as
                    a condition of their funding, making the question of how to maintain and manage
                    an ongoing project a more urgent one.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e237">[5]</a>
            </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">This article seeks to fill a gap in scholarly discussions of project management
                    for the digital humanities by discussing the challenges, not of launching a new
                    project, but of managing a mature one. It does so through a case study of
                    project management activities at the William Blake Archive, one of the
                    longest-running digital humanities projects in existence. The Blake Archive,
                    launched in 1993 at the University of Virginia’s Institute for Advanced
                    Technology in the Humanities, published its first digital scholarly editions in
                    1996 and now includes over 120 electronic editions of works by William
                        Blake.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e246">[6]</a> As Project
                    Manager of this ongoing and actively publishing digital archive,<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e271">[7]</a> I will offer insights into the challenges of
                    managing a digital humanities project that is approaching its twentieth year.
                    These challenges differ significantly from those of launching a new project but
                    should nevertheless be considered by scholars just beginning their DH endeavors.
                    I begin with a discussion of the important but sometimes hidden role that
                    project management skills play in successful DH projects, and then follow with a
                    set of general observations about managing mature projects, illustrated with
                    specific examples from recent activities at the Blake Archive.</div>

                <h1 class="head">Making the Implicit Explicit: Project Management for the Digital
                    Humanities</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Project management is often described as a "soft skill" and placed in
                    opposition to — or in competition for scarce resources with — the "hard
                        skills" of programming and software development. In a 2012 <cite class="title italic">DH Answers</cite> discussion on "Founding
                        staff for a new DH Center," for instance, several discussants
                    asserted that a project manager is a relatively low-priority hire for a new DH
                    initiative; one respondent asserted that because "most
                        academics already have experience managing projects," programmers and
                    developers should be hired first and a manager only later [<a class="ref" href="#dhcenter2013">ACH 2013</a>]. Early Project Bamboo documentation refers to best
                    practices for project management as "the softest kinds of
                        standards," placing them behind "domain-specific
                        technical standards" in terms of importance [<a class="ref" href="#ucbconference2013">Bamboo 2013b</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e309">[8]</a> The distinction between "hard" and
                        "soft" skills or standards imports a number of unfortunate
                    connotations; a better formulation might center on the difference between
                    explicit and implicit skills. While a new hire or graduate student’s mastery of
                    a programming language can be codified in certifications or a portfolio of
                    existing projects, it is much more difficult to test for the capabilities —
                    including organization, planning and follow-through, prioritization, grant
                    administration, human resources management, and conflict resolution — that are
                    essential in a project manager. If you want to assess someone’s technical
                    skills, you can always invite them to a hack-a-thon. There is no such thing as a
                    manage-a-thon.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">As a position defined, in most cases, largely in terms of implicit skills,
                    project management can be usefully placed in a category with those forms of
                        "material labor" defined by Helen Burgess and Jeanne Hamming that
                    encompass <blockquote><p>both physical movement and the kinds of
                            "material" actions necessary to provide an infrastructure for
                        digital media. On an immediate level, these actions can be thought of as a
                        nodal network of bodies and machines in which machines <em class="emph">combine

                        wider infrastructural support necessary for producing such media objects:
                        the institutional search for grants, the subvention of copyright clearances,
                        the securing of financial support for and mentoring of graduate students,
                        and [the coordination of] technical assistance provided by, variously,
                        presses, contract programmers, videographers, and animators. [<a class="ref" href="#burgess2013">Burgess and Hamming 2013</a>, par. 8]

                    related to the form of a project rather than its content, and thus are often
                    overlooked or even denigrated under scholarly models that elevate content
                    (writing <em class="emph">about</em> new media) over form (the production <em class="emph">of</em>
                    new media). The importance of project management for digital humanities
                    scholarship thus risks demotion on several fronts: because project management
                    skills fall under the heading of neither subject matter expertise nor technical
                    expertise — both much more explicit and quantifiable modes of knowledge than the
                    implicit skills of project management — they often go unexamined, and because
                    they primarily affect the form rather than the content of a project, they can be
                    underappreciated according to traditional evaluative models for scholarly work. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">But it is precisely those practices and standards that are most hidden from
                    immediate view — those considered to be implicit, assumed, or already mastered —
                    that should be most assiduously excavated and explored by scholars wishing to
                    further the collaborative work of the digital humanities. This is perhaps
                    especially true when the tasks of project management are performed, not by a
                    professional hired specifically for the purpose, but by a project’s principal
                    investigator or by programmers or developers who are expected to manage
                    themselves. Making explicit the tasks and aptitudes required for good project
                    management can help to reduce the frustration felt by principal investigators or
                    developers who find themselves unexpectedly occupied with organizational tasks
                    and stakeholder relationships that seemingly have little to do with researching
                    content or writing code. Once these implicit tasks and expectations are made
                    explicit, it becomes easier to recognize how indispensable they are, whether a
                    team has one member or 100.</div>

                    work at the William Blake Archive, that demonstrate how the management of a
                    mature and ongoing project differs from that of a newly established one. While
                    these principles may not apply to all established projects — there is
                    considerable difference, for instance, between maintaining a static project that
                    is still in existence but no longer being actively developed and one that, like
                    the Archive, is still growing and changing — I believe they can provide guidance
                    to project managers (as well as content providers, developers, and other
                    collaborators) who have moved beyond the planning stage and are anticipating a

                        are incorporated. At a 2012 roundtable on digital humanities and digital
                        pedagogy at the conference for C19: The Society of Nineteenth-Century
                        Americanists, Kenneth Price raised the question of how scholars "know"
                        their subjects. Speaking of the challenges facing the Walt Whitman Archive
                        as its editors encounter objects like Whitman’s grocery lists or, even more
                        problematically, letters and official correspondence transcribed by Whitman
                        but composed by others, Price wondered, who is the Whitman we "know" in
                        the context of the Whitman Archive? Is it Whitman’s handwriting? Whitman’s
                        mind? </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">I would argue that such questions, about how we know our subjects, are

                        documents, investigate and represent geospatial data, or comb through
                        massive textual corpora. "Knowing" is not the
                        outcome of scholarly endeavors; it is a process that is furthered
                        collaboratively by members of a project team (and by its users), and that

                        Archive’s earliest publications sought to make available to scholars digital
                        editions that would reflect the unique artistic processes that Blake used to
                        create his illuminated books, and so our most basic ontological units are
                        the <em class="emph">work</em>, the <em class="emph">copy</em>, and the <em class="emph">object</em>:
                        art-historical terms that, in the case of Blake’s work, exist on a kind of
                        sliding scale from the theoretical to the material.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e400">[10]</a> The <em class="emph">work</em> is largely an editorial
                        concept: <cite class="title italic">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</cite>, for
                        instance, is a work by Blake that we, as editors and readers, recognize only
                        by virtue of the nine complete and individually printed <em class="emph">copies</em>
                        in existence. Each of these copies is made up of twenty-seven
                            <em class="emph">objects</em> printed on paper from a set of copper plates and
                        arranged in an order that need not remain consistent among copies. (There
                        are also three additional copies of the <cite class="title italic">Marriage</cite> consisting of only three or four objects each.) The
                        texts and images that make up each of these objects can also vary greatly
                        depending on whether and how Blake inked each of the copper plates, what
                        colors he used, and whether he added or altered the objects with pen or wash
                        after printing. In other words, there is no definitive copy or edition of
                        the work known as <cite class="title italic">The Marriage of Heaven and
                            Hell</cite>. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Confusing as this may seem, in an illuminated book the distinction between
                        the work, the copy, and the object is actually relatively clear, and is
                        represented hierarchically in the Archive’s three-level structure, in which
                        users progress via hyperlink from a list of Blake’s works, to a list of
                        available copies of a particular work (<cite class="title italic">The Songs of
                            Innocence and of Experience</cite>, for example), to a list of objects
                        in a particular copy (such as copy Z), and finally to an individual object
                        (say, "Infant Joy"). But these ontological
                        distinctions have become less obvious as the Archive has begun acquiring and
                        publishing Blake’s works in other media, including engravings, watercolors,
                        tempera paintings, manuscripts, and letters. A watercolor drawing such as
                            "The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed with the
                            Sun," for instance, is a one-of-a-kind creation in which the
                        work, the copy, and the object are one and the same; Blake’s notebook, in
                        which he sketched preliminary drawings and drafted verse and prose, is a
                        manuscript work that exists in only one copy made up of multiple objects.
                        The matter of ontology extends to every aspect of the Archive’s design, from
                        individual object view pages to our main index: since the Archive’s basic
                        organizing principle is the medium of the work in question, image filenames
                        include designators like "WC" for watercolor and "MS" for
                        manuscript, and the site’s table of contents is arranged by medium, with
                        illuminated books followed by commercial book illustrations, then separate
                        prints, then drawings and paintings, then manuscripts and typographic works.
                        Under such conditions, issues of classification and organization must be
                        perpetually renegotiated: how, for instance, should we classify a book of
                        poetry composed by Blake, printed for him by others, and then emended in
                        Blake’s hand? Is this a typographic edition or a manuscript?</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Questions of classification are, of course, intimately related to problems of
                        presentation and display: "one needs to balance the

                        [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2004">Ramsay 2004</a>]. At the Archive the problem of classification
                        drove the development of a new "Related Works"
                        feature that links objects in different media across wings of the Archive.
                        Every new digital edition published in the Archive (a set of watercolor
                        drawings, for instance, or Blake’s engraved illustrations to a commercially
                        published book) includes a list of works related to the newly published
                        work. In the early years of the Archive these lists, generated by the
                        editors, often included works illustrating texts by the same author, so
                        that, for instance, every one of Blake’s watercolors illustrating one of
                        Milton’s texts was considered "related" to every other watercolor
                        illustrating Milton. But when Archive staff began building a tool that would
                        actually link related works within the Archive (rather than just listing
                        them for users to seek out on their own), we began to question this
                        bibliographic definition of "relatedness" and its epistemological
                        implications for our project. Were Blake’s watercolor illustrations to
                        Milton’s <cite class="title italic">Comus</cite>, commissioned by Joseph Thomas
                        in 1801, "related" to the designs for <cite class="title italic">Paradise
                            Regained</cite>, completed no earlier than 1816, by virtue of anything
                        other than Milton’s authorship? And if "texts by the same author" was a
                        valid definition of "relatedness" for the Archive’s purposes, then was
                        every one of Blake’s illustrations of the Bible "related" to every
                        other one — with God understood as "author"?<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e493">[11]</a>

                        same production sequence — a material definition of "relatedness" that
                        reflects Blake’s unique creative processes. By the Archive’s standards,
                        then, objects are related if they represent different stages in the creation
                        of a work.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e522">[12]</a> Thus, the monochrome wash drawings that Blake produced

                            Virgil</cite> (1821) are related to the wood engravings published in
                        that book because they represent earlier stages in Blake’s artistic
                            process.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e531">[13]</a>

                        printed. "Supplemental Views" are distinguished
                        from "Related Works" because they refer not so

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">New and early-stage projects are often plagued with the problem of "scope
                            creep," a phenomenon in which a manageable and fairly well delineated
                        project is derailed because the primary stakeholders cannot or will not
                        limit their ideas of what the project will be: as team members with varying
                        levels of technical knowledge and content expertise envision all of the
                        directions a project <em class="emph">could</em> take, they can find themselves going
                        everywhere and nowhere at once. In the beginning stages of a project, one of
                        the project manager’s major duties — and the reason why they sometimes come
                        across as spoilsports — is preventing scope creep by holding the team to
                        agreed upon project parameters. For this reason, "project management for
                            beginners" articles often emphasize the importance of setting
                        realistic goals and limiting a project’s early ambitions. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">But projects that are ten or twelve years along are less likely to suffer
                        from scope creep than those in the beginning stages. If a project’s founders
                        did their jobs well (and if a project is functioning productively after a
                        decade, the chances are good that they did), by this point team members and
                        collaborators probably have a realistic understanding of the task at hand.
                        Once a team has mastered the primary functions of a project and brought it
                        beyond the planning stages, widening the project’s scope becomes the next
                        logical step in its development. At this point, a project manager’s
                        priorities shift from preventing unwanted change to facilitating productive
                        growth. </div>

                        widen the scope of our endeavor by adding to our database 40 years of back
                        issues of <cite class="title italic">Blake/An Illustrated Quarterly</cite>, the
                        journal of record in Blake studies.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e640">[15]</a> The Blake Archive has been
                        publishing digital editions of Blake’s work for sixteen years; its
                        publication processes have been relatively stable over that time, though
                        they have been adapted somewhat to reflect both changing technology and the
                        nature of Blake’s work. (The Archive is designed such that a publication
                        process that works flawlessly for an illuminated book will require tweaking
                        for a manuscript or watercolor.) The decision to incorporate searchable back
                        issues of <cite class="title italic">BIQ</cite> came about not only in response
                        to changing paradigms of scholarly publishing, with many major journals now
                        available in digital form, but as a way of maximizing the Archive’s existing
                        assets. As back issues of <cite class="title italic">BIQ</cite> are scanned,
                        transcribed, and marked up for inclusion in the Archive, images that
                        appeared as halftones in the print edition are being replaced, whenever
                        possible, with the same high-resolution color-corrected JPEGs that make up
                        the Archive’s digital editions. Thus, scholars reading Eugenie R. Freed’s
                        article from the Winter 1998 issue of <cite class="title italic">BIQ</cite> on
                        the Christian symbolism in plate 78 of Blake’s illuminated book <cite class="title italic">Jerusalem</cite> will see a full-color inline
                        illustration of plate 78 and can also access the Archive’s digital edition

                        source, not only for high-quality digital editions of Blake’s work, but for
                        scholarly commentary on that work. The incorporation of <cite class="title italic">BIQ </cite>represents scope change of the best kind: a manageable
                        improvement that was perhaps not foreseen by the Archive’s founders, but
                        which aligns with the primary goal of the Archive — to make Blake’s work,
                        and excellent scholarship about it, available free of charge to as wide an
                        audience as possible — and thus enhances the project’s scholarly value.</div>

                        life for older projects, "feature creep" — the wish to make existing
                        tools perform more and more functions, just because they can — can be a
                        major source of contention in ongoing projects. While the manager of a new
                        project can often nip feature creep in the bud by appealing to time, staff,
                        or budget constraints — the "let’s just get this up and
                            running and then we’ll see" strategy — a digital project that is
                        humming along happily is rife with opportunities for tinkering. Add to this
                        what I call the "educator imperative" — the wish, common among
                        academics, to give users/readers as much information as possible — and
                        project managers may find themselves fighting the notion that because an

                        is neither prohibitively difficult nor particularly expensive — it

                        fulfills its early goals and develops in new directions. The Blake Archive’s
                        Compare feature, for instance, was built to automatically display objects in
                        the illuminated books that were printed from the same copper plate,
                        regardless of the order in which they appear in individual copies; it does

                        available in the Archive. Over the years, as the Archive moved from
                        publishing only Blake’s illuminated books to his works in other media as
                        well, Archive staff realized that objects in different media would not
                        automatically display in the Compare window. In response to this situation
                        the Archive’s Technical Editor, Will Shaw, revised the Compare code to allow
                        for manual inclusion of objects in different media. In the image below, for
                        instance, objects from <cite class="title italic">The Small Book of

                        and <cite class="title italic">Visions of the Daughters of Albion</cite> (both
                        illuminated books). Like the integration of <cite class="title italic">BIQ</cite>
                        (though on a much smaller scale), this change reflected the logical
                        development of an existing tool rather than feature creep run amok.</div>

                        an existing tool, but a kind of techno-utopianism (often felt most strongly
                        by those team members least responsible for coding and programming) that, if
                        allowed free rein, can quickly lead to unnecessary redundancy. At the
                        Archive, the danger of feature creep is that every tool will be expected to
                        do everything: the Compare feature, the Virtual Lightbox, the Related Works
                        feature, and any number of other tools would all perform the same functions,
                        leading to confusion for users and frustration for technical staff. As
                        Morris Eaves has argued elsewhere, tools in the Blake Archive should not do
                        the work of scholarship <em class="emph">for</em> the user, but should instead enable
                        users “to make useful things for themselves. With tools, applied to the
                        primary textual and pictorial materials, users construct the contexts most
                        relevant to their purposes” [<a class="ref" href="#eaves2006">Eaves 2006</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e779">[18]</a> Will Shaw, now Digital Humanities Technology

                            tools load faster and may be more responsive to user input [while]
                            multipurpose tools are almost certainly larger and possibly less
                            efficient from a computational standpoint, not to mention that they can

                        of the spectrum is our book of image search terms: as the Archive’s editors
                        and project assistants prepare new works for publication, they write
                        descriptions of Blake’s images using an art historical vocabulary specific
                        to Blake’s iconography; these descriptions, in turn, enable the Archive’s
                        image search feature. As assistants add new terms to our image description

                        to see if these new terms apply; when we decided to add the term "mane"

                            "hide" certain documents from the XSL transformation that
                        dynamically generates our tables of contents. This will eventually make it
                        possible for proofs and impressions of an illuminated work to appear in the

                        Becomes</h2>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">One of the most exciting and frightening aspects of digital humanities
                        projects is their reliance on distributed expertise. This need is present
                        from the beginning of nearly every project; rare (though not unheard of) is
                        the digital humanist who can single-handedly write code, mark up data, build
                        a database, design web interfaces, write grants, manage a staff, and provide
                        expert content. (Rarer still is the scholar who can do all of these things
                        while teaching, publishing, and serving on numerous committees.) The longer
                        a project exists, the greater the number of collaborators (or, to use the
                        private-sector term, stakeholders) — principal investigators, editors,
                        project managers, grant administrators, developers, deans, graduate
                        students, undergraduate assistants — who will pass through the project and
                        contribute their particular strengths. Over time, the distributed cognition
                        necessary to continue the venture will change as the project’s staff, size,
                        funding, and location change, so the uncertainty that often characterizes
                        digital projects can have temporal, geographic, economic, or personal
                        dimensions. Wrangling a project’s collective knowledge, including the
                        lingering — could we call it "spectral"? — contributions of past
                        collaborators, is one of a project manager’s most challenging tasks.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">Within the last few years the Archive’s collective knowledge has become more
                        geographically diffuse as the project, which is published at the University
                        of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has opened a satellite office at the
                        University of Rochester, where Morris Eaves and Project Coordinator Laura
                        Whitebell (who has just replaced longtime coordinator Rachel Lee) oversee
                        the production of digital editions of Blake’s manuscripts.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e845">[21]</a> The
                        Rochester assistants have quickly become the Archive’s foremost experts on
                        manuscript tagging and markup, with the result that a large segment of the
                        Archive’s institutional knowledge is housed on a different campus from its
                        primary administrative and technical site. But in addition to its geographic
                        dispersal, Archive expertise has become more temporally diffuse as well, as
                        graduate and undergraduate staff members join and then leave the project,
                        contributing their analytical and practical skills to publications that take
                        years to move through the transcription and markup process. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">The Archive’s decision, in recent years, to begin publishing electronic
                        editions of Blake’s unique works in manuscript — including his letters, his
                        prose satire <cite class="title italic">An Island in the Moon</cite>, the
                        notebook in which he drafted poems and sketched designs, and the visionary
                        poem <cite class="title italic">Vala, or The Four Zoas</cite> — has necessitated
                        a major redesign of the Archive’s markup tagset and transcription display
                        protocols. Early Archive publications reproduced Blake’s illuminated books,
                        each of which Blake printed in multiple copies from a copper-plate matrix
                        that remained relatively stable from printing to printing.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e857">[22]</a> The Archive’s
                        original transcription tagset was thus quite simple and straightforward. The
                        publication of manuscript works including <cite class="title italic">An Island in
                            the Moon</cite> and Blake’s late letters necessitated considerable
                        changes to this tagset to reflect strike-throughs, underlined text, carets,
                        and other manuscript features not found in the illuminated books. This more
                        robust tagset has served the Archive well for several years, but the
                        Rochester team’s preliminary work on Blake’s <cite class="title italic">Four
                            Zoas</cite> manuscript has revealed that another round of substantial
                        changes will be necessary — changes that will be undertaken over a period of
                        years and with an ever-changing staff.<a class="noteRef" href="#d12995e867">[23]</a>

                        ten years, <cite class="title italic">The Four Zoas</cite> is a far cry from the
                        relatively straightforward, almost "fair copy" clarity of <cite class="title italic">Island</cite> and of Blake’s letters. The poem combines
                        drawings and text in an extended response to Edward Young’s devotional poem
                            <cite class="title italic">Night Thoughts</cite>; during its composition
                        Blake frequently erased large swaths of his own writing and covered the
                        erasures with new verse. Composed in part on leftover proof sheets from
                        Blake’s engraved illustrations of Young’s work, the manuscript was unbound
                        and reordered by Blake’s posthumous editors. As Fiormonte, Martiradonna, and
                        Schmidt have recently reasserted (the insight is one long known to textual
                        critics), "if we either look at the different historical
                            representations of a given text or at its documented writing stages, we
                            realize that there is not one text, but many texts, as many as there are
                            mechanisms of writing, material production, intertextual paths and
                            methodologies of reconstruction"

                            <cite class="title italic">Four Zoas</cite> are a Blakean’s delight and a

                        current staff and past collaborators. The composition sequence of <cite class="title italic">The Four Zoas</cite> has been successfully limned by the

                        has to commit to a certain level of perpetual uncertainty. This uncertainty,

                            with no answer to the haunting question of where and how a project like

                        Workflows and procedures often change incrementally. A process that was once
                        the sole province of programmers or the technical editor will get easier for
                        other staff to implement (or vice versa — a seemingly simple task will get
                        harder); a collaborator who shows a talent for a particular task will take
                        it over entirely; login procedures and passwords will change as the

                        change the way project work is completed. If documentation is not updated
                        frequently and thoroughly, those responsible for documenting project history
                        and necessary procedures can be overwhelmed to find that workflows have been

                            outline the tasks for the upcoming year. Second, they are also the time
                            to resolve those 'thorny' issues that could not be easily resolved
                            on conference calls or by email during the year"

                        more likely to stick with a digital humanities endeavor if you feel
                        genuinely passionate about it. But the nature of that passion will change
                        over the years, as the thrill (and occasional agony) of launching a new
                        project gives way to the satisfaction of maintaining an ongoing one. And

                        wooed away, collaborators will stop answering email. While as a project
                        manager one is trained to plan for achievable goals and projected endpoints,
                        at these moments it can help to think in terms of relationships rather than

                        a few arguments; digital projects require similar patience. This is the

                        a project has moved from development to maintenance, the incentive structure
                        that enables it to proceed will have to change. Students and potential
                        collaborators who volunteered their time to initiate a new project may find
                        an ongoing one less appealing, so it may be necessary to rethink how credit
                        is distributed, how work on the project fits into graduate and undergraduate
                        training, and where and how students and faculty present and publish the
                        results of their work. Such shifts, while they require time and effort to
                        initiate, can actually operate in a project’s favor. For instance, while
                        granting agencies are more likely to support new, exciting projects than
                        reliable, established ones, deans and department chairs often value results
                        and products that they can tout in annual newsletters and the university
                        magazine. Once your digital project has been underway for several years, has
                        grants and awards to its name, and has produced or inspired articles and
                        monographs, it may carry more weight with administrators not versed in
                        cutting-edge digital humanities research. That weight may then translate
                        into research assistantships, office space, or a teaching reduction.</div>

                        satisfaction of completing a task, of pronouncing something "done."
                        "It was easy to measure progress as I ticked off tasks
                            in email messages to the archive’s editors," Kirschenbaum wrote.
                            "In time, when enough of these individual tasks were
                                'done,' the project might be finished"

                        necessary to publish new electronic editions of Blake’s work every other
                        month. But the idea that the Archive might ever be finished is foreign to
                        me; since I arrived at Joseph Viscomi’s door in August of 2005 I have been
                        perpetually reminded that the William Blake Archive is a scholarly resource
                        in a constant state of growth and change. If the Archive ever manages to
                        publish scholarly editions of every illuminated book, watercolor drawing,
                        manuscript, letter, receipt, engraving, etching, sketch, scrawl, and
                        scribble that Blake produced during his long and prolific lifetime, there
                        will still be Blake’s circle and his throngs of admirers, both contemporary
                        and modern, to include. In other words, infinity is our project limit.</div>

                        Archive to surpass its goal of making high quality electronic editions of
                        Blake’s work available to scholars and to move toward its larger vision of
                        becoming a catalogue raisonné, critical edition, and comprehensive database
                        of all or nearly all of Blake’s work. Decisions made at the beginning of the
                        project — about approaching contributing institutions, curating images and
                        data, and cultivating project staff — were vital, and continue to influence
                        the Archive’s day-to-day operations. But the need for thoughtful management
                        practices has, if anything, increased as the project has achieved and moved
                        beyond its early objectives. As the digital humanities field grows, it will
                        become increasingly important to consider whether and how projects should be
                        maintained beyond their early development stages. Project management for the

                            share of upgrading at the Archive: from WBA 1.0 to WBA 2.0, from SGML to
                            XML, from DynaWeb to eXist, and then to later iterations of eXist.
                                "WBA 2.0" was the Archive’s first major site redesign,
                            occurring in 2001. It streamlined site organization and featured the
                            launch of the new Compare and Navigator tools. At this point the
                            Archive’s digital editions were still created in the Standard
                            Generalized Markup Language (SGML); the transition to Extensible Markup
                            Language (XML) began in 2005 and was completed in May of 2006. The XML
                            conversion also necessitated a change from the DynaWeb SGML server to
                            eXist, an open-source native XML database. The Archive currently uses
                            eXist version 1.4.</div><div class="endnote" id="d12995e400"><span class="noteRef">[10]</span>
