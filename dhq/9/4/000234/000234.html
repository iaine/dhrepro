                <p>A behind the scenes look at the process and practice of the
                    author's dissertation written and drawn entirely in comics
                    form. Specifically, the commentary explores the thinking and
                    sketches behind the opening part of the third chapter titled
                    "The Shape of Our Thoughts," which focuses on the interaction between image and text.</p>
            </div>
            
        
        
           <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">This serves as a behind-the-scenes look at the opening six pages
                from the third chapter of my dissertation, which I wrote and
                drew entirely in comics form. Some background: I completed the
                dissertation in May 2014 for a doctorate in education from
                Teachers College at Columbia University. The work consists of
                132 comics pages along with references and such. Titled <cite class="title italic">Unflattening,</cite> through its very form it
                makes a metaphorical argument for the importance of visual
                thinking in teaching and learning. A primary concern of the work
                is that the visual is never mere illustration to accompany ideas
                in written text, rather the form itself embodies the content.
                Visual and verbal are equally integral to making meaning. In
                that regard, the following commentary is rather at odds with my
                point – it’s all words <em class="emph">about</em> pictures.
                Thus, this behind-the-scenes look is <em class="emph">not
                </em> meant to serve as an explanation – the pages stand on their
                own and I’d recommend reading this only after seeing them. Due
                to <cite class="title italic">Unflattening</cite> being published by
                Harvard University Press (<a class="ref" href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674744431" onclick="window.open('http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674744431'); return false">http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674744431</a>),
               the pages discussed only appear on my website here: <a class="ref" href="http://spinweaveandcut.com/ch3-opening-amphibious-refraction/" onclick="window.open('http://spinweaveandcut.com/ch3-opening-amphibious-refraction/'); return false">http://spinweaveandcut.com/ch3-opening-amphibious-refraction/</a></div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Let me open with a brief overview of what has come
                prior to contextualize these pages. In the opening chapters, I
                develop the notion of flatness as a narrowing of sight and a
                contraction of possibilities in which inhabitants lack the
                critical dimension to see beyond the borders of the systems
                they’re born into and are ultimately complicit in perpetuating.
                <div class="figure">
                    <a href="resources/images/figure01.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure01.jpg" alt=""/></a>
                <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 1. </div></div></div>
                Given the setting I’m theorizing within, I am addressing issues
                in education and schooling, but neither term is ever used. This
                conscious avoidance of specific terms and instead relying on
                verbal and visual metaphors is something I employ throughout the
                entire dissertation, with the intention of creating a work that
                doesn’t turn the reader away with specialized or politicized
                language, but can invite them to find their own way of
                connecting to the material. 
                <div class="figure">
                    <a href="resources/images/figure02.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure02.jpg" alt=""/></a>
                <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div></div></div>
                Having set up the problem, I suggest
                ways to move beyond flatness by engaging in a discussion of
                interdisciplinarity through the metaphor of perspective – a
                seeing through two (or more) eyes – as a means for stepping out
                of imposed boundaries (and again, I never use such terms as
                "discipline" or "interdisciplinary").</div>
           <div class="figure">
               <div class="ptext"><a href="resources/images/figure03.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure03.jpg" alt=""/></a></div>
           <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 3. </div></div></div>
            
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">With this third chapter, "The Shape of Our
                    Thoughts," I’m turning from the more general approaches
                of engaging multiple modes set forth earlier to specifically
                take up image and text. The chapter builds to a discussion of
                how the comics form works – and why comics are so well-suited to
                convey and embody my argument (though that falls outside of the
                excerpt discussed here). </div>
            <div class="figure">
                <div class="ptext"><a href="resources/images/figure04.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure04.jpg" alt=""/></a></div>
            <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 4. </div></div></div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">A little overview of my process: I’m frequently asked
                whether the words or pictures come first. To which I answer each
                time, truthfully but not particularly helpfully, "yes." From an
                initial notion, I begin jotting down notes and images to start
                to give it substance. It is then, in that spatial interplay
                between my visual system and what I’ve sketched that the piece
                starts to take shape. The sketches shown throughout this
                commentary are representative of that process. Let me also here
                offer a few general thoughts about making comics, at least from
                my perspective. Unlike storyboarding, to which comics are often
                compared, working in comics requires a concern not just for what
                goes in the panels, but also attention to the size, shape, and
                location of the panels on the page – where they are and what
                they’re next to – really a consideration of the entire
                composition as a whole experience. Art Spiegelman refers to this
                as "architectonics," and I think the connection between comics
                and architecture and the way both disciplines organize spatial
                experiences for a viewer/visitor to move through – is
                significant. Where a prose document can stop in mid-thought and
                continue on the next page – comics can’t – each page needs to be
                considered as a whole unit. Its shape (hence the title of this
                chapter) informs its content and contributes significantly to
                the meaning conveyed.</div>
            <div class="figure">
                <div class="ptext"><a href="resources/images/figure05.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure05.jpg" alt=""/></a></div>
            <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 5. </div></div></div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Okay, on to the specifics: the initial image I sketched
                for this sequence was the man’s head partially submerged on what
                has now become the third page. That partially submerged image
                just kept asserting itself and so I moved outward from it as an
                anchor from which to build the rest of the sequence. For some
                time, I’d been toying with hybridity – specifically
                amphibiousness – as a metaphor for comics’ capacity for holding
                both visual and verbal modes in a single form. The notion that
                language is a sea we swim in was also a recurrent image and they
                complemented one another nicely. 
                <div class="figure">
                    <a href="resources/images/figure06.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure06.jpg" alt=""/></a>
                    
                <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 6. </div></div></div>On this opening page, I wanted
                to draw the focus on this central figure, impossibly deep,
                isolated and alone and immersed in his thoughts – this sea is
                his entire world. Had this been an essay in text, I would likely
                have opened with something about "words are a tool, words are a
                trap" – but since the trap aspect is not evident in the imagery,
                I shifted that language to another page, and that choice in turn
                shaped how the following page came together.</div>
            <div class="figure">
                <div class="ptext"><a href="resources/images/figure07.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure07.jpg" alt=""/></a></div>
            <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 7. </div></div></div>
       <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">For the second page, I now could show this trap,
                conceived as a bubble of sorts that would become evident as we
                pulled back further. This progression called explicitly for a
                sequential series of images. I think my first attempt was to
                have him revealed to be in a snow globe. This was ok, but it
                felt a little forced, and I knew, because I had this amphibious
                figure to work towards, that somehow I needed him to emerge from
                it, which didn’t work in a globe! Seeking inspiration, I
                happened to look at the flowing vine-like glass sculptures my
                wife created, and saw that that world inside the solid glass,
                with air bubbles trapped and frozen within, was a world much
                like the one in which I envisioned this figure swimming.
                This idea was closer – it had the right feel, if not the right
                form. As I laid out the three pages in thumbnail form, I saw the
                connection between this scene and the close up on the figure’s
                eyes in the next page. Of course, it was like a pupil enclosed
                by the iris! 
                <div class="figure">
                    <a href="resources/images/figure08.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure08.jpg" alt=""/></a>
                <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 8. </div></div></div>
                Essentially, it matched my earlier sketches of the
                bubble but now I had a specific reason for its presence that
                held the page together. It seems strangely obvious after the
                fact – this is all about seeing, how could it not be exactly
                this image?! (This revelation reminds me of one of my favorite
                essays on the creative process – a short piece by Alan Moore at
                the back of the collected edition of <cite class="title italic">V for
                    Vendetta</cite>. The book, as with most of Moore’s works,
                appears to have been made from a perfect crystal, emerged fully
                formed from his brow. But the details of the story’s creations
                as he outlines it, is this bizarre set of wrong turns, stumbling
                luck, synchronicitous moments, and the willingness to keep
                following along where it took him and artist David Lloyd to
                arrive at the final result.) As for the particulars of this
                page’s layout, text and image are working tightly together and
                informing one another. In the top panel, our figure is in the
                depths but seems under control. Next, the boundaries begin to be
                revealed and by the third panel we begin to see how he’s
                enclosed in something beyond his awareness. Descending further,
                he’s smaller and more adrift than in charge. Finally, the eye is
                clearly revealed, and the text returns to talking explicitly
                about seeing.</div>

                from his introduction to Gyorgy Kepes’s "Language of Vision,"
                and his two-page essay served as significant inspiration for
                much of this chapter. My text, "to breach the surface…" is the
                first mention specifically of the medium I’m working in. Comics
                as hybrid form. Its denizens must be amphibious in terms of
                being at home and able to breathe in either text or image. Our
                man remains submerged, not gasping for air. His eye is posed
                just as the final panel of the previous page. Has that figure
                emerged or is he residing still within himself – creating a loop
                of sorts. Looking to the text above him – we’re "seeing from
                other sides." Again, thinking about the page as a spatial
                experience, it is both a sequential reading experience as well
                as a simultaneous viewing experience. Here the text is a visual
                element in terms of moving our eye through the page. "Text
                immersed in image," came to me early on, but its partner for how
                to describe what happens to pictures was more difficult. In an
                earlier piece, I’d played with the idea of suggesting pictures
                in comics as being anchored by words, but I’d left it out in not
                wanting to suggest text is more concrete than images are. But
                here it came back to me, and the idea that the box would be
                below the other made it function a bit like an anchor as well.
                This led me to recall Roland Barthes and his description of
                image-text relations as "anchor" and "relay." And then the
                pieces all came together and I could use "relay" to come back to
                referring to the boundaries and give a text reference to "fluid"
                to accompany the imagery. It’s both discussion and demonstration
                at once. The final line is a joke that sets up the most
                self-reflexive page of the piece.</div>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">I knew from the very beginning that at some point in the
                dissertation, that there had to be a single page completely in
                text that looked exactly like a dissertation was supposed to
                look. I thought it would be the first page of this chapter, but
                I think it worked out more effectively here – the contrast is
                particularly jarring in the midst of the narrative. In part this
                was inspired by conversations in my dissertation proposal
                seminar, where colleagues suggested – out of expressed concern
                for my behalf – that maybe I should do half in text to explain
                what I’m doing and why I’m doing it in comics. As the political
                implications of this piece became increasingly apparent, I
                realized there could be no hedging. In order to truly
                demonstrate the form’s legitimacy, I found it essential to go
                all in. And that was that moving forward. By including the image
                of the bent pencil, I really wanted something that looks like
                and was set apart in just the way an illustration would be in an
                academic text. (Though note, the juxtaposition of the text
                talking about "mere illustration" and the illustration itself – despite the form here, I’m still
                playing with image-text interaction.)

                Plato’s cave is
                tangentially referenced earlier in the narrative, and I had
                wanted to revisit that here. Initially, the Descartes discussion
                was a separate page, but in thinking on Iris Murdoch’s
                discussion of Plato’s view of the arts in her book <cite class="title italic">The Fire and the Sun,</cite> I eventually made
                the leap to join Plato’s sun/fire and Descartes’ candle, which
                would in turn provide light for the cave wall shadows (and this
                image is plucked from an earlier chapter). Again, this seems
                obvious in hindsight, but in the midst of it, it’s just an
                organic mess of notes and sketches and some guiding notion that
                I’m trying to hang onto and see where it leads. The burning of
                the page also came late in the process, but I think that the use
                of trompe l’oeil holds the whole thing together – and points
                strongly to the artificiality of a particular form being held up
                as what knowledge should look like.</div>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">One more note on this page – when I submitted the
                dissertation to the office of doctoral studies for corrections,
                it came back to me with almost no comments – except that because
                this page had a "figure" on it (that bent pencil image), I
                needed to have a list of figures denoting it at the beginning of
                the whole document. Now, in a document completely made of
                images, I would have a list of images pointing to exactly one
                page – the one with the most text on it of the entire piece and
                where I most directly turned to the reader to point out the
                convention I’m challenging. A rather delightful irony – and one
                I think only made my point stronger.</div>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">The page on Descartes and dissection is part of my
                broader argument addressing the reduction of the human to the
                thinking machine – and a removal of the role of the senses in
                constituting thought. This had been all combined on a single
                page with the page following, but that just kept not working –
                it was much too tight, so I pulled it out and gave the idea of
                dissection and duality their own space. Often breaking things
                apart like this has let me look at the images and ideas from a
                fresh perspective, and figure out what it is I’m exploring with
                much greater understanding than I had before.

                Even with this
                clarity, this page still posed some particular challenges. I
                wanted to show this incision as unfolding in time and opening up
                an interior space. 
                <div class="figure">
                    <a href="resources/images/figure15.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure15.jpg" alt=""/></a>

                But, a knife moving down creates a cut moving
                upwards – which works against the way we read it top to bottom –
                the reveal happens in time rather than in space as it does in
                comics.) While I was mulling this over, one of my students in my
                class made a sketch of a pattern of upside down "V"s. 
                <div class="figure">

                This
                random image triggered a better solution for how to arrange the
                composition. The brain in the vat – half-submerged – is also
                intended to return us to the idea of being immersed in the sea
                that is language, while the dissection imagery was in part
                triggered by thinking about dissecting frogs, which in turn
                takes me back to thinking about 
                amphibiousness.</div>

                was figuring out the entire sequence, and really served as the
                glue that kept it all from reading as a series of separate
                ideas. Reflecting briefly once more on my process, one of the
                guiding principles was gleaned from my advisor Ruth Vinz, who
                places an emphasis on the "search" in research, and sees it as a
                journey to follow where one’s curiosity leads. In this case, I
                was exploring Descartes’ writings – unaware at the outset of his
                role in explaining the phenomenon of refraction. But in coming
                upon that, I had my eureka moment tying everything together.
                This is two-fold.
                <div class="figure">
                    <a href="resources/images/figure18.jpg" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure18.jpg" alt=""/></a>
                <div class="caption-no-label"><div class="label">Figure 18. </div></div></div>
                First, there’s the James Burke-like aspect of
                it in terms of a series of historical "Connections" linking
                Descartes and refraction as a means of returning to and
                responding to Plato’s bent reed example. But still more exciting
                – as I’d been referencing air and water throughout the chapter,
                in injecting the concept of refraction that occurs between these
                two mediums, I could also use it as a metaphor for the
                interaction of visual and verbal mediums (which continued to be
                an important thread running through the rest of the chapter).
                Breaking into scientific explanations might seem a bit
                extraneous, but throughout this work – as with the concept of
                seeing perspective or being amphibious – I’m always seeking to
                address two things at once. Here, refraction as phenomenon but
                also the way image and text bend meaning in their respective
                ways. Perhaps the most important thing that has emerged for me in working in the manner that I do, and
                is strongly evident in this example, is that in trying to
                address aesthetic concerns, I’m prompted to do more research,
                and delving into the reading pushes me to pursue new images.
                It’s a generative cycle and I find it takes me places that
                absolutely wouldn’t occur to me were I working only in text. In
                this regard, I find that comics are not only more than up to the
                challenge of presenting serious inquiry, but also they serve as
                a powerful thought-space to help expand our research process
                from the ground up.
