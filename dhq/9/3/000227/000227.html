                <p>We present "archival liveness" as a concept in design and the Digital
                    Humanities and describe its development within a Research Through Design
                    process. Working with a newly acquired archive of contemporary poetry we
                    produced designs that both manifested and 
                        "geared in to"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#durrant2011">Durrant 2011</a>]

                     the temporal rhythms of the work and infrastructure of archiving. Drawing
                    on user-centred work with participants, often poets themselves, we focused on
                    marginalia as a material feature of the archive, developing a drawing machine
                    and live Twitter bot. Our work addresses institutional concerns for outreach and
                    engagement while also acknowledging and exploiting the inevitably incomplete or
                    live character of archival collections. For designers working with digital
                    archives, we demonstrate the pragmatic and critical value of liveness as a focus
                    of the design process.</p>

                    become a crucial means of accessing our heritage and their design has become a
                    subject of interest in interaction design [<a class="ref" href="#dork2014">Dork 2014</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#dork2011">Dork 2011</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#feinberg2014">Feinberg, Carter, and Bullard 2014</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#feinberg2012">Feinberg 2012</a>]. With a wealth of digital material being made
                    available by institutions many have produced rich and innovative interfaces of
                    their own e.g. (Smithsonian Design Museum n.d.) or in collaboration with
                    researchers [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2013">Whitelaw 2013</a>]. A number of methodologies have been
                    applied to such design processes including engaging potential users of the
                    interface in its design [<a class="ref" href="#povinelli2011">Povinelli 2011</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#huvila2008">Huvila 2008</a>], or developing interfaces as critical lenses on
                    cultural collections [<a class="ref" href="#dork2014">Dork 2014</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#feinberg2012">Feinberg 2012</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#feinberg2014">Feinberg, Carter, and Bullard 2014</a>]. Despite the popular image of archives as static
                    and authoritative, digital archives and cultural collections are dynamic.
                    Cataloguing, description and digitization are slow and costly processes; as such
                    archives exist in various forms of incompleteness yet institutions are under
                    pressure to share digital collections in order to better engage with a
                    contemporary audience [<a class="ref" href="#mansfield2014">Mansfield 2014</a>]. There is consequently
                    conflict between the state of completeness of the archive and the need for
                    institutions to share what they have.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">In answer, we present a novel approach to the design of archive and collection
                    interfaces and introduce the concept of <em class="emph">archival liveness</em> as a
                    concept which opens "the play of possibilities for
                        design"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#anderson1994">Anderson 1994</a>] and affords designers new formal and conceptual
                    considerations in working with archival materials before and during cataloguing.
                    Archival liveness promotes a view of the archive as a set of on going
                    professional, institutional and technical processes and precipitates a focus on
                    the different kinds of temporality embodied within these. Throughout our design
                    work we made a feature of some of the distinctive temporal features of the
                    archiving process and used them to reflect on the way that the archive is used
                    and presented.</div>

                    [<a class="ref" href="#gaver2012">Gaver 2012</a>] in which we designed a range of experimental
                    interfaces, visualizations and interventions for an archive during the process
                    of cataloguing and digitization. We discuss this work as Research Through Design
                    because of its associated methods some of which we adopted through our work and
                    because of its speculative and experimental orientation. Throughout this article
                    we use "interfaces" to refer to the online catalogue interfaces we were
                    developing. We refer to aspects of this interface work as "visualization"
                    where it is specifically data driven and involving graphical representation.</div>

                    focus of our design interventions we address an area of concern to archival
                    institutions [<a class="ref" href="#dooley2013">Dooley 2013</a>]. That is, we take the incompleteness
                    and long time scales of archiving as features of interest, not as problems to be
                    overcome. In doing so we identify benefits for design researchers working
                    collaboratively with archivists and for producing aesthetically and critically
                    interesting designs. We therefore hope that aspects of our approach are
                    repeatable by other designers, for other archives.</div>

                        concerns around archives has begun to pervade discussions of designing for
                        the archive. This tendency reflects themes in archive-oriented humanities
                        scholarship, since the early 1990’s in particular [<a class="ref" href="#derrida1995">Derrida 1995</a>], about the role of archives as repositories of culture and archivists and
                        institutions as producers of versions of the past [<a class="ref" href="#hardiman2009">Hardiman 2009</a>]. As archival practice has become increasingly

                        concerns, disciplines and epistemologies center on the technologies and
                        practices of archiving, and their relationship to older critical
                        perspectives from the humanities. The overlap of Human Computer Interaction

                        have suggested that work remains in considering liveness in interaction more
                        broadly. During the early phases of our research we were frequently
                        confronted with a number of technical and experiential ways that the archive
                        could be considered as subject to live processes (such as the ongoing
                        activities of digitization and cataloguing) and indeed, could be considered
                        itself as "live". These considerations lead us to consider notions of
                        archival liveness and its possible application to the study of the user
                        experience of archives, collections and their interfaces.</div>

                        and their relationship to archival standards (by whose terms should the

                        describes the production of an archive of cultural information with and
                        about indigenous Australians. The interface to this archive attempted to
                        recreate patterns of knowledge sharing (and exclusion) particular to the
                        group in question. Huvila [<a class="ref" href="#huvila2008">Huvila 2008</a>] highlights the
                        importance of knowledge held by future users of an archive of local history

                        system. These explicitly participatory projects come with a considerable
                        commitment in time and resources. Although these results are valuable, we

                        without the sometimes prohibitive costs involved in pure PD processes. One

                        two main design proposals both of which adopted the archival marginalia as a
                        starting point for a creative design intervention. A further design was
                        produced early in this process and is described separately. Although neither
                        of the former two was in itself an interface design, both were produced to
                            "lead" to the catalogue and future interfaces to it in different
                        ways. The first design intervention was a live Twitter bot, connected to the
                        digitization process in the library (see Figure 4). The server running the
                        bot uses machine learning techniques to separate handwritten notes and
                        illustrations before tweeting the resulting image with a link back to a
                        catalogue page with basic catalogue information. The detection of this
                        marginalia relies on the results of optical character recognition (OCR) as
                        performed by the Tesseract OCR engine [<a class="ref" href="#smith2007">Smith 2007</a>]. </div>

                            circumventing existing procedures. In the Bloodaxe Archive a
                            conventional workflow was in place wherein items were catalogued and
                            scanned, and image files converted for preservation. The cataloguing was
                            conducted using a web-based tool which eventually aggregates the
                            collection with other UK archives. This kind of workflow is based on a
                            long production cycle and with the assumption that the catalogue will be
                            published near the end of the cataloguing process. Further, there was
                            little formal connection between the catalogue and digitized files.
                            Although they were connected by reference numbers, the digitized items
                            were not seen as part of the archive, but as illustrations for the
                            catalogue.</div>
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">The cataloguing and digitization process as described above had a
                            distinct <em class="emph">kind</em> of temporality associated with it. It was
                            based on batch processing, a strict sequencing of cataloguing and
                            digitization and an ultimate cycle of around eighteen months (after
                            which point the funding would be exhausted). We felt that this rigid
                            timescale concealed a host of rich features of the archiving process by
                            effectively silencing the project until its conclusion. In this sense
                            the "liveness" of the archive was suppressed.</div>
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Despite the formality of this workflow, we were aware that a parallel set
                            of informal organizational practices were at work in the library. For
                            instance the archivist preferred to keep her catalogue in spreadsheets
                            before transferring new records to the records management software at
                            the end of the month. The digital assistant meanwhile had a complex but
                            well-defined folder structure by which she kept track of which documents
                            had been scanned, converted, uploaded and saved. Through regular contact
                            we were able to negotiate access to these intermediate working
                            structures in order to engage with the processes behind the production
                            of an archive. While doing so we were careful to communicate our
                            intentions to the archive staff so that they understood that these areas
                            were to be partly made public. An example of one outcome of this access
                            can be seen in a visualization<a class="noteRef" href="#d35939e871">[2]</a>
                            we produced for the participants.</div>
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">The visualization shows relations between the roughly sorted boxes (see
                            Figure 6) in which the archive was delivered to the university. If an
                            author or title is in both box 6 and box 15, for instance, this
                            connection will be drawn on the graph and a list produced on the right
                            hand side. Also visible in the image is a figure for the most popular
                            (as in most viewed by participants) box (44 in this case). While
                            ostensibly a tool by which participants could more efficiently search
                            the boxes, this visualization also served the purpose of showing a
                            pre-catalogued representation of the archive; the archive in its nascent
                            state. As such it was a "time marker" in the process of archive
                            creation. More importantly for our argument it was made possible by
                            access to two items; an informal spreadsheet provided by the vendors of
                            the archive, Bloodaxe Books, and a Microsoft Word document in which the
                            archivist recorded the participants’ archive box requests. Neither were
                            part of the formal cataloguing process but <em class="emph">working

                            that such documents which support the daily work of the archive are

                            support our intervention. The particular affordances of the technologies
                            involved also played a significant role in developing our
                            characterization of archival liveness. Such affordances defined this
                                "site for work". We explored, tinkered with and organized those
                            technologies according to a mixture of technical criteria (what will be
                            stable) and aesthetic and theoretical ones (what organization of
                            technical resources would most aptly reflect the work in the archive).
                            By doing so, a sense of the human inflected our technical work, just as
                            technical considerations inflect the (human) work of the archivist and
                            digital assistant. That is to say that archival liveness reflects an
                            integrated set of technical and human factors which together define the
                            particular kinds of time in the archive.</div>

                            to the digitization of new images in the Bloodaxe archive. To make this
                            possible we developed scripts that would scan a working folder on the
                            server space of the digital assistant. With her consent, we asked the
                            university technical services for read-only permission to this shared
                            storage. Similarly, we wrote scripts to convert exports of the catalogue
                            to a data structure to support a work in progress online catalogue. We
                            emphasize these points because they are germane to our wider discussion
                            that our process was not part of the envisaged production flow for the
                            archive. We further suggest that these opportunistic technical
                            interventions take advantage of the "mess"
                            described by Dourish &amp; Bell 2011 [<a class="ref" href="#dourish2011">Dourish and Bell 2012</a>] as
                            fundamental to the character of contemporary networked technology.</div>
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">To check the status of the shared folder we wrote a simple shell script
                            triggered by a Cron process. Cron is a Unix tool for scheduling the
                            execution of scripts, but it comes with its own temporal constraints. It
                            is designed for regular tasks and accordingly can be scheduled to run on
                            the minute (at the most), on the hour (or n minutes afterwards),
                            everyday and so forth. In that sense Cron became part of the temporal
                            range of archiving activities as we connected it to our designs. While a
                            scheduled check seems to break the immediacy implicit in the notion of
                            liveness, we felt that "live" does not necessarily imply
                                "continuous". The archive is live insofar as it is an ongoing
                            process. Breaks and pauses such as those introduced by Cron are part of
                            the <em class="emph">texture</em> of its liveness. Although it might be argued
                            that Cron processes are not part of the core of the archive, we argue
                            that its use as a scheduling process as part of the technological
                            infrastructure of the archive effectively defines it as such. In this
                            sense by using Cron as part of our design intervention we were making an
                                <em class="emph">aesthetic claim</em> that this kind of time should be part
                            of the texture of archival liveness in this archive.</div>

                            feature of the technologies. Our script cross referenced each item in
                            the shared folder (of multipage scanned PDFs) with each item in another
                            folder, where extracted and compressed JPEG versions were stored, in
                            order to identify new PDF files. This process itself was lengthy because
                            of the volume of files involved, taking around half an hour to run. Once
                            a new file was found, a series of further processes added to the
                            execution time. First the PDF was extracted to individual JPEGs using
                            command line image processing software ImageMagick [<a class="ref" href="#imagemagick">ImageMagick</a>]. Then the JPEGs were resized to produce
                            thumbnails for the website. A PHP script was then called to update the
                            catalogue with the new file information. Next a further script produced
                            the marginalia image before finally the image was tweeted along with a

                            timelines and alienate or annoy them. Equally however we wanted to
                            retain a sense of the particular rhythms of the archival process, so to
                            tightly schedule updates felt restrictive. To reconcile these two
                            opposing concerns we allow a maximum of three marginalia images per hour
                            to be tweeted. As this compromise shows, we sought to manage the

                        work in the archive: the working rhythms of the archivist and digital
                        assistant, the execution and scheduling times of the technologies, and the
                        frequency with which we updated the Twitter feed and Marginalia Machine. Our
                        motivation for these designs was to manifest the liveness of the process of
                        archiving within our designs but a tight binding to this process was in
                        conflict with the technical and experiential concerns we outlined. However
                        rather than seeing this as a compromise, we suggest that archival liveness
                        is embodied equally in these three facets and that weight should be given to
                        each within the design process. Following Freeth and Tanaka [<a class="ref" href="#freeth2014">Freeth, Bowers, and Hogg 2014</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#tanaka2000">Tanaka 2000</a>] we prefer to see these different temporal
                        qualities as features of material interest. We observe that the adoption of
                        and experimentation with such features of materials is entirely
                        characteristic of Research Through Design processes and indeed one aspect
                        that differentiates them from other design practices. </div>

                        the various constraints and affordances of the server infrastructure we
                        reflect an obvious historical tension between the working patterns of people
                        and technologies design to support them. Rather than representing this
                        distinction as a binary one however, our approach based in archival liveness
                        nuanced our understanding of the particular kinds of temporality in
                        different parts of what might be thought of as an ecosystem of work and
                        technology. The pursuit of archival liveness, as we have said, brought us
                        into closer contact with the archivist and digital assistant as well as the
                        library technical services team. With this close contact we gained unusual
                        access to the way their work was organized across a diverse technical
                        infrastructure. We observed a disjuncture in the temporal patterns of the
                        archival process and the way that the archive was accessed by our
                        participant researchers. Where the archivist and digital assistant worked to
                        long time frames with a tendency to batch processing and repetitive
                        activity, the participants were inclined to "dip in and out" of the
                        archive irregularly. Our intervention through Twitter in some senses mimics
                        this comparison. After running the bot for several weeks, we noticed that in
                        periods when digitization was taking place, tweets would commonly appear
                        around 5pm; seemingly the digital assistant placed scanned PDFs in the
                            "complete" folder as one of her last tasks of the day. The
                        appearance of the tweeted marginalia image on followers’ Twitter timelines
                        however will be interspersed with other material. What was a semi-regular
                        event for the digital assistant manifested as sporadic for the followers of
                        the bot. </div>

                            [<a class="ref" href="#gurwitsch1979">Gurwitsch 1979</a>] describe a scenario wherein visitors
                        adjust to the infrastructure of a theme park as it aims to present a
                        particular mode of experience. The process by which the visitors begin to
                        socially organise their visit around this infrastructure is one of "gearing in". In the context of the archive we can
                        see the progression of our design interventions from the cultural probes to
                        box log connections, to the Twitter bot and Marginalia Machine as ways of
                        learning to "mesh" our designs with the work of the archive. Our
                        treatment of archival liveness was in many ways a process of orientating
                        ourselves to the various rhythms of the archiving process and the materials
                        available at each stage. One practical advantage of this "gearing in" was that we were able to produce
                        engaging, timely designs at stages of the project earlier than might have
                        been otherwise possible. More significantly, this gearing in gave us access
                        to a rich set of materials and concepts, prompting designs that offer new
                        modes of engagement and reflection on the archive. </div>

                        principally because of our desire to engage users with the archiving work.
                        However by highlighting the archiving process we were also creating a public
                        performance of the Bloodaxe Archive as live. Liveness was being presented as
                        part of the public identity of the archive. In this presentation, we find
                        direct accord with other digital heritage initiatives. As archive catalogues
                        are aggregated into web services and interfaces, a number of interesting
                        points arise regarding the permanence and stability of archives and their
                        expression through catalogues and interfaces. Application Programming
                        Interfaces (APIs) such as [<a class="ref" href="#trove">National Library of Australia</a>] now provide aggregated
                        access to the collections of thousands of institutions. The constantly
                        changing nature of the collections defined by the scale of such aggregations
                        suggests a particular sense of the live archive (as growing, more available,
                        more diverse) in contrast with the "dead" one (as complete, finished
                        and closed). The National Archives of Australia recently launched “SODA”
                            [<a class="ref" href="#soda">National Archives of Australia</a>] a service which publishes the most recently
                        digitized records from across their aggregated resources. The developers
                        make the point that the constantly changing state of the catalogue makes it
                        difficult to know which new records are available. By facilitating easy
                        access and sharing the Archive’s aim to convey a sense of the rate at which
                        the collection is growing [<a class="ref" href="#trove">National Library of Australia</a>] they hope to engage
                        potential users in the new content. As in our case, liveness is implicitly
                        part of the way the public identity of the archive is performed.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p59">59</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p59">Earlier, we suggested that our work designing with and for liveness offered a
                    response to concerns about the role of archives in institutionalising the past.
                    In our case, the Marginalia Machine and the Twitter bot were ways of
                    simultaneously investigating archival liveness and engaging our project
                    participants and wider audiences with the archival process, with the
                    work-in-progress catalogue interface design and with the project more generally.
                    While our own work (so far) does not afford significant opportunity for users of
                    the archive to intervene in the cataloguing process we believe that further
                    potential for this exists. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p60">60</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p60">To produce such design work has methodological implications as described but
                    also, we feel, indicates a role for a particular kind of researcher. Such a
                    researcher would have an interdisciplinary background, sensitizing her to the
                    value and interest of the archival materials while bringing a range of technical
                    and creative skills enabling different kinds of design intervention. She would
                    be in a position to quickly conceptualize, develop, and release work in an
                    opportunistic and occasional fashion, using the materials made available, early
                    and often. This particular kind of working practice (one that is agile,
                    responsive, opportunistic) may encounter difficulties at larger scales. As we
                    have suggested, one of the values of our way of working was in supporting a kind
                    of familiarity not only with materials and technical systems but also with the
                    working patterns and concerns of our colleagues in the library. Much of our work
                    was produced with what was effectively unfinished materials (the
                    work-in-progress catalogue particularly) and this access was negotiated on a
                    personal level. A future challenge for this work is to consider how some of the
                    rich temporal features of archiving may translate on a scale where such
                    negotiation is not feasible. One emergent design consideration here is how the
                    technical tools of archivists (such as archival data base software) might be
                    designed to reflect a variety of states of "finishedness" rather than
                    simply being unavailable until the point of completion. It is interesting to at
                    least speculate on the possibilities for design if the default state of
                    catalogues in progress were accessible rather than closed. They could then be
                    used in a timely and experimental way taking advantage of the liveness of the
                    process of archiving.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">Other aspects of our work are more broadly applicable elsewhere. Although
                    user-oriented processes for designing archival interfaces are not without
                    precedent e.g. in [<a class="ref" href="#huvila2008">Huvila 2008</a>] they remain the exception. Rather
                    than as a set of more general user experience (UX) concerns focused on
                    usability, we indicate the suitability of Research Through Design methods as a
                    kind of culturally sensitising activity which we maintain is appropriate, indeed
                    necessary for designing for archive and cultural collection interfaces. We deem
                    this sensitivity "necessary" given the vital role such interfaces have in
                    mediating our cultural heritage. If we, as a society, are to encounter our
                    cultural heritage in digital forms online and elsewhere it seems appropriate to
                    engage ourselves in a conversation about not only usability but also aesthetics
                    and creativity informed by engagement with future users. With this inclination
                    however we immediately encounter future questions regarding the relationship
                    between presentation and interpretation in design work such as ours. Much of the
                    work we produced exemplified our particular attitude to archival materials in
                    which we see them as having value for future creativity. Although our particular
                    interventions were informed by our work with project participants it is
                    undeniable that in their presentation as (at least partly) creative works, we
                    injected our own interpretative stance into their presentation. The later
                    results of this approach can be seen online in our catalogue interface<a class="noteRef" href="#d35939e1077">[3]</a>. This work (which we will discuss
                    in more detail in a forthcoming paper) combines conventional functionality such
                    as search and filter with facets of visualisation, text-mining and image
                    processing techniques to generatively produce connections around the archival
                    materials.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">One of the motivations for maintaining an ostensibly neutral catalogue based on
                    international standards for record keeping is to defer the interpretative moment
                    outside of the catalogue and its interface to allow for a plurality of
                    approaches later on. We sympathise with this position but it is hugely
                    problematized of course by the nature of any claims to neutrality. As Drucker
                        [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2013">Drucker 2013</a>] has pointed out, the design of our interfaces
                    already embodies an epistemological commitment inherited from particular
                    cultural traditions and emphasising hierarchy, standardization, and objectivity.
                    With this characterisation in mind we feel that there remains a huge role for
                    user-oriented, Research Through Design methods in exploring the line between
                    presentation and interpretation.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">Archival liveness addresses a desire (and a need) for the archives and
                    collections to make their holdings publically accessible. Digital archives are
                    dynamic: continually expanding, taken up in larger aggregations, being
                    re-catalogued and described. Thus, a model of design that treats the archive as
                    static, whole, and complete is often not appropriate. With this research we have
                    demonstrated that design interventions before or during the cataloguing and
                    digitization process benefit from early access to a wider range of materials and
                    have the potential to engage audiences and future users of the archive along the
                    way. Above and beyond this though, we have demonstrated the use of archival
                    liveness in a particular kind of Research Through Design process. Archival
                    liveness encouraged us to treat the various temporalities of the archive as
                    material with which to design and provided us with a number of distinct ways of
