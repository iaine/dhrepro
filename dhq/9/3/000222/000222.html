                <p>This paper documents the results of an intensive "data sprint" method for
                    undertaking data and algorithmic work using application programming interfaces
                    (APIs), which took place during the Digital Method Initiative 2013 Winter School
                    at the University of Amsterdam. During this data sprint, we developed a method
                    to map the fields of Digital Humanities and Electronic Literature based on title
                    recommendations from the largest online bookseller, Amazon, by retrieving
                    similar purchased items from the Amazon API. A first step shows the overall
                    Amazon recommendation network for Digital Humanities and allows us to detect
                    clusters, aligned fields and bridging books. In a second step we looked into
                    four country-specific Amazon stores (Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.fr and
                    Amazon.de) to investigate the specificities of the Digital Humanities in these
                    four countries. The third step is a network of all books suggested for the
                    Electronic Literature field in the four Amazon stores we searched, which offers
                    a comparison to the field of Digital Humanities.</p>

                <h1 class="head">INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In this article we seek to tentatively explore the field of digital humanities
                    (DH) through the production of particular outputs of knowledge rather than the
                    tools that are used. In this we are, perhaps, acting counter to the often
                    remarked processual aspect of DH, that is, that digital humanities focuses not
                    just on the outputs but also on the processes involved in producing those
                    outputs, by, for example, creating data sets, digital tools, archives, etc. [<a class="ref" href="#berry2012">Berry 2012</a>]. However, as part of a rapid
                        "Data Sprint", research outputs, in this case books and
                    monographs, offer a means of producing quick datasets amenable to analysis under
                    the tight restrictions on time that the Data Sprint form imposed upon us. We
                    undertook this analysis to examine the epistemic connections represented through
                    a network analysis of key texts in the field and we also aimed to explore the
                    extent to which the digital humanities differ in comparable countries. By
                    including an analysis of the field of electronic literature we sought to compare
                    DH writ large to a possibly more specific discourse field. Electronic literature
                    includes genres such as kinetic poetry, hypertext fiction, social media fiction
                    and generative narratives, where the "the computer (or the
                        network context) is in some way <em class="emph">essential</em> to the performance or
                        carrying out of the literary activity in question"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rettbergs2014">S. Rettberg 2014</a>], and is a strong subfield or related field to the
                    digital humanities, depending on one's perspective.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This article brings two contributions to the field of DH. Firstly, we show the
                    relevance of the "data sprint" method for DH inquiry, during which data are
                    collected and analyzed over a short period of time, offering a mezzo-level of
                    analysis between small and large datasets (or "big data").
                    Secondly, we show how web-based digital platforms can be repurposed to offer
                    insightful data sources to investigate the field of digital humanities itself,
                    therefore contributing to reflexivity in the community. Concerning the first
                    point: the data sprint was part of a Winter School held at the University of
                    Amsterdam in 2013<a class="noteRef" href="#d36968e312">[1]</a> and was designed to facilitate
                    short-form data analysis work in a rapid prototyping format, rather similar to
                    hacklabs and hackathons. The term data sprint itself is drawn from the notion of
                    a Book Sprint which is a "genre of the ‘flash’ book, written
                        under a short timeframe, to emerge as a contributor to debates, ideas and
                        practices in contemporary culture... interventions that go well beyond a
                        well-written blog-post or tweet, and give some substantive weight to a
                        discussion or issue...within a range of 20-40,000 words"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#berry2012">Berry 2012</a>]. This rapid and collaborative means of writing is
                    very creative and intensified, and tends towards the creation of
                    texts that are appropriately geared to a specific subject or topic [<a class="ref" href="#hyde2013">Hyde 2013</a>]. Indeed, participants in a Book Sprint, who are not
                    always necessarily professional writers, are usually experts in a field but from
                    a range of professions, backgrounds and interests. Book Sprints themselves are
                    usually formed from 4-8 people actively involved in the writing process, and
                     are facilitated by another non-writing member. However in the data sprint,
                    which created this paper, the team was made up of five members with varying
                    degrees of competence in data analysis and programming. Nonetheless, the basic
                    tenets of the Book Sprint were observed, in as much as the data sprint was
                    carried out over a period of three days aiming towards final presentation of the
                    results at a workshop organised at the University of Amsterdam. This compression
                    of time naturally results in rapid prototyping and scoping aggressively in order
                    to produce the work within the timeframe available, nonetheless it creates an
                    extremely creative space for the use and reuse of data and algorithms in digital
                    humanities-type work. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Due to the "data sprint" format of this project, several members were
                    involved in multiple projects at the same time, or were not working
                    co-locatedly. As a consequence, we heavily relied on online collaborative
                    applications in order to work remotely together. A specific Skype channel was
                    used for multiple purposes: after the tasks were divided between the various
                    members, it served as a means to let the others know which step was done. It was
                    also used to ask questions on a specific task. Furthermore, it served to quickly
                    transfer lists of ASIN numbers from the seed books, or to transfer .zip files
                    containing Gephi files resulting from requests to the Amazon API. Collaborative
                    spreadsheets on Google Drive were a means to collaboratively write descriptive
                    tables of seed books, but also to share first results from the graph (e.g. in a
                    spreadsheets showing Eigenvector Centrality, indegree or outdegree - see below).
                    Finally, a Dropbox was used to share .gexf (Gephi) files resulting from the
                    crawling, and to share the graphs after working on the visualisation. Data
                    sprints are based on reproducibility: the work done needs to be documented and
                    shared online in order to foster similar work and further developments. In
                    parallel to the collaborative online applications used to work together, we set
                    up a website<a class="noteRef" href="#d36968e335">[2]</a>
                    from the beginning that served to document the methods, process, and results of
                    our work. Similarly, crawl results and graphs were instantly uploaded on a
                    specific Github page<a class="noteRef" href="#d36968e340">[3]</a>, as was the code accompanying the project<a class="noteRef" href="#d36968e346">[4]</a>.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Secondly, this article demonstrates how digital methods [<a class="ref" href="#rogers2013">Rogers 2013</a>] can be useful to reach a reflexive account of the field of DH. By doing so,
                    we rely on both traditional social network analysis and digital methods. One way
                    of mapping a field, and the approach we take here, is by locating the books that
                    are read by its scholars. Traditionally this has been done by citation analysis
                        [<a class="ref" href="#desollaprice1965">De Solla Price 1965</a>] for example by using Web of Science or,
                    more recently, Google Scholar. There are also examples of network analysis of
                    citations, for instance as in Dan Wang’s analysis of key texts in sociology

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Within the graph visualisation (Figure 1) each node represents a book. It is a
                    directed graph which means that the edges between the source (book A) and the
                    target (book B) are directed (A points to B). In our case the edges represent
                    recommendations so the source (book A) points to the target (recommended book B,
                    C, D etc.). We retrieved recommendations to a depth of three, meaning that our
                    data set includes the seed books (i.e. depth 0), books recommended in relation
                    to the seeds (i.e. depth 1), books recommended in relation to the books in depth
                    1 (i.e. depth 2), and books recommended in relation to the books in depth 2
                    (i.e. depth 3). </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">What we see in Figure 1 is the clustering of particular books into more or less
                    distinct genres or disciplinary groups. For example, we see that there are many
                    connections between books on internet and technology, electronic literature and
                    game studies, but fewer between game studies and book studies, or between book
                    studies and speculative realism. A closer reading of this visualization by a
                    topic expert on the Digital Humanities, David M. Berry, revealed that the books
                    cluster around particular fields within the Humanities such as Digital
                    Humanities, Media Studies, Literary Studies and related areas. We identified the
                    following clusters from the visualisations produced: Game Studies, Electronic
                    Literature, Internet and Technology, New Materialism, Digital Humanities, Book
                    Studies, Deleuze Studies and OOO/Speculative Realism. Some books appeared to
                    form bridges between the fairly distinct clusters, such as Hayles’ <cite class="title italic">How We Think.</cite></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">We also see here how, while some books are densely interconnected leading to the
                    clustering in the graph, others simply lead away from the initial seeds. An
                    example is Bate’s <cite class="title italic">The Public Value of the
                        Humanities</cite> (2011), which is bought by many Amazon customers who
                    bought Gold’s <cite class="title italic">Debates in the Digital Humanities</cite>
                    (2012). However, as you see from Figure 2, people who bought Bates’ book don’t
                    tend to buy many other digital humanities books. Instead they are more likely to
                    buy other books about universities and the current crisis in academia. This
                    suggests that digitial humanists are interested in the crisis in academia, but
                    those interested primarily in the crisis in academia are not, on average,
                    particularly interested in the digital humanities. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">We also see many connections between the seed books, which suggests that our
                    initial choice of seeds was reasonably representative of the field.</div>

                    recommendations to two. This means that we only looked at similar items

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">Our analysis suggests that electronic literature is a far less cohesive field
                    than digital humanities is in the USA, at least in so far as printed books can
                    be said to represent the field. Figure 8 shows the network of all books returned
                    for our electronic literature seed books in the four Amazon stores we searched,
                    and you can see that a large number of books were returned for the seed books.
                    The seed nodes, which are marked in yellow, are scattered around the graph
                    rather than clustered in the center as in the US digital humanities graph in
                    Figure 3, and they are not heavily recommended, as is indicated by the small
                    size of most of the seed nodes. The two seed books within electronic literature
                    that Amazon.com notes readers of other books buy are Hayles’ <cite class="title italic">Electronic Literature</cite> and Aarseth’s <cite class="title italic">Cybertext</cite>, but as Figure 8 shows, the Force Atlas 2
                    algorithm in Gephi does not pull them close together, although they are directly
                    linked to each other. This is because people who buy these two books also buy
                    books in distinctly different fields: <cite class="title italic">Electronic
                        Literature</cite> connects to DH, book culture, and disucssions of
                    materiality, and <cite class="title italic">Cybertext</cite> to game studies. There
                    are very few links directly between game studies and DH or game studies and book
                    culture. Between <cite class="title italic">Electronic Literature</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Cybertext</cite> we see a range of key texts in new media
                    studies that are also important in electronic literature, such as Manovich’s
                        <cite class="title italic">The Language of New Media</cite>, Bolter and Grusin’s
                        <cite class="title italic">Remediation</cite>, and Jenkins’ <cite class="title italic">Convergence Culture</cite> as well as core media studies texts such as

                    point of view (see Table 4), we can see that although the electronic literature
                    graph has fewer nodes, it is actually more densely connected than the DH one
                    (see density and average degree). Looking at the average path length, one can
                    see that it is easier to reach other books given a book related to EL according

                    clearly not going to tell the whole story about digital humanities or electronic
                    literature. This type of study of the field excludes other book sellers and
                    traditional scholarly resources such as journals and journal articles and also
                    excludes the outputs of digital humanities projects such as archives, TEI
                    projects, websites, tools and code archives, and also works of art and
                    literature which are central to the field of electronic literature. Also, it
                    bears the temporal limitations imposed by the time constraint of the three-day
                    data sprint format. Finally, there are also technical limitations using the
                    Amazon API in our survey of the fields of electronic literature and digital
                    humanities, such as a limit of ten recommendations per book and a maximum of

                    the Amazon database allows us to see interesting connections between the digital
                    humanities and adjacent fields. Also, even with these caveats it is notable that
                    the results, broadly speaking, do reflect clusters of what we might think of as
                    fields of study, and the connection between them. </div>

                    give information about what other books are bought by customers who buy book X,
                    book sales don’t necessarily mean that the books are read, cited, used, or
                    influential. In addition, customers who buy digital humanities books also buy
                    other books on Amazon and if books are frequently bought together they will be
                    marked as "similar" by Amazon as recommendation engine. This

                    chosen French and German language books, we thought the results yielded were
                    still interesting, and many non-English titles rapidly appeared in these graphs.
                    The seeds introduced similar language-specific items on the topic of digital

                    they appear to have different styles of communication, at least in terms of the
                    importance of printed books in the field. The field of digital humanities in the
                    USA as viewed through Amazon’s SimilarityLookup is cohesive, with a relatively
                    small number of books that are bought together. In France and Germany, on the
                    other hand, we see that the field is far less well defined, and based on the
                    books that are bought together, it is hard to say clearly what the digital
                    humanities are or are not in these countries. Britain offers an intermediate
                    position, where the digital humanities are understood in a less precise or
                    perhaps broader manner than in the US, and where we see relationships to many
                    more fields. </div>

                    SimilarityLookup, is a field that is far less cohesive than the digital

                    intermingle with books in related disciplines: new media studies, game studies
                    and the digital humanities chief among them. Game studies in fact comes to the
                    fore in the graph drawn from our electronic literature seeds, and appears to be
                    a field almost as cohesive as the digital humanities in the US. </div>

                    by looking at the books published in the field rather than at the digital

                    of digital humanities is very clearly defined by its books. Our diagrams would
                    be an excellent starting point for a reading list for a newcomer to the digital
                    humanities. Electronic literature, on the other hand, is not as easily described
                    by this method. Perhaps more of the publications on electronic literature are
                    entirely digital, whether as creative works or as shorter articles in online
                    journals and other online publications, and thus they are not visible to Amazon.
                    Or perhaps electronic literature is more interdisciplinary by nature, and thus
                    people who read books about electronic literature read more broadly rather than
                    focusing on that topic alone. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">The ability to create the graphs from the API is extremely powerful and although
                    we undertook some limited secondary data generation, such as querying the Kindle
                    Highlights database<a class="noteRef" href="#d36968e1808">[23]</a>, it would be useful to
                    formalise this method and generate sufficient data which when linked to the
                    primary graph data enables interactive exploration of the graph output.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p59">59</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p59">As an example of further research we ran some preliminary data requests to the
                    Kindle Highlights database, however, the number of highlights in our texts was
                    very low. Most digital humanists either do not read the digital (or at least,
                    the Kindle) versions of the texts, or they do not highlight their digital
                    versions. Nonetheless, with the growth in e-readers, iPads, tablets, and the
                    like, we can expect this database to be of increasing interest to researchers
                    undertaking similar projects to this in the future. For example, these are the
                    most popular highlights in Kirschenbaum’s <cite class="title italic">Mechanisms: New
                        Media and the Forensic Imagination,</cite> which is important to both the
                    digital humanist and electronic literature subject areas. </div>

                    this approach has much to recommend it. It provides a useful entry point for
                    drawing up an initial map of the field and for developing understanding of the
                    way in which books provide a structure for a field's development. Whilst we wish
                    to reiterate the limitations of this approach, particularly in view of the
                    digital nature of the two fields we chose for comparison, digital humanities and
                    electronic literature, and the resultant absences in the data and visualisations
                    that are created, we nonetheless think that used appropriately it is a method
                    that is very amenable to an exploratory method of field-mapping. </div>

                        digital humanities and Jill Walker Rettberg selected ten key books in the
                        field of electronic literature. The concept of seed used here is drawn from
                        the computational use of pseudo-random numbers to begin a computational
                        process, it is a term also used in "Minecraft" to indicate a starting number

                        paper is a set of values, in this case book ASINs, which can be used to
                        bootstrap the API call process. Using 10 seeds rather than just one
                        increased the space of results which could be produced from the Amazon API
