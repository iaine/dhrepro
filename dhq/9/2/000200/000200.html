                <p>When game studies became an area for scholarly inquiry in the
                    academy, feminist game studies soon followed. The first
                    generation of feminist theory in game studies built on the
                    work of Sherry Turkle, Brenda Laurel, and Janet Murray,
                    although some might argue that the legacy of challenging
                    gender norms in game studies goes back even earlier. Now
                    feminist game scholars organize international conferences,
                    edit journals and scholarly collections, and shape trends in
                    the profession, much as their counterparts in the digital
                    humanities attempt to do, but critics in feminist game
                    studies have been able to take advantage of what is seen as
                    a relatively long trajectory of feminist theoretical inquiry
                    and field development. Articulating a need for a feminist
                    corrective in the digital humanities has come at a much
                    slower pace, perhaps because the instrumentalism of a "tool"
                    seems much less blatantly anti-feminist than the
                    instrumentalism of a gun. Furthermore, calls to action from
                    more radicalized forms of feminist approaches to science and
                    technology studies have been noticeably absent in the
                    literature around digital information retrieval in the
                    humanities. This issue of <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> indicates that a sea change
                    may finally be taking place. </p>

           <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">When game studies became an area for scholarly inquiry in the
                academy, feminist game studies soon followed. After all, when so
                many videogames so obviously featured ejaculatory shooting,
                sexual conquest, objectified femininity, alienated labor,
                separation of the domestic and commercial spheres, physical
                domination, zero-sum negotiations, and waging mass warfare, the
                need for feminist responses to the aggression and opportunism
                represented in computer games might have seemed self-evident.
                The first generation of feminist theory in game studies built on
                the work of Sherry Turkle, Brenda Laurel, and Janet Murray,
                although some might argue that the legacy of challenging gender
                norms in game studies goes back at least to the countercultural
                subversion of the new games movement in the sixties and
                seventies or the work of the Situationists. Perhaps the
                correspondence between Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage about
                his mechanized tic-tac-toe game may point to an even long
                history of feminist engagement in algorithmic game culture. Now
                feminist game scholars organize international conferences, edit
                journals and scholarly collections, and shape trends in the
                profession, much as their counterparts in the digital humanities
                attempt to do, but critics in feminist game studies have been
                able to take advantage of what is seen as a relatively long
                trajectory of feminist theoretical inquiry and field
                development. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Articulating a need for a feminist corrective in the digital
                humanities has come at a much slower pace, perhaps because the
                instrumentalism of a "tool" seems much less blatantly
                anti-feminist than the instrumentalism of a gun. Furthermore,
                calls to action from more radicalized forms of feminist
                approaches to science and technology studies, epitomized by
                decades of work spanning from Donna Haraway to Kavita Philip,
                has been noticeably absent in the literature around digital
                information retrieval in the humanities. Tara McPherson has
                argued that the early humanities computing projects were
                actually characterized by reactionary tendencies to shun
                feminism, queer theory, and multiculturalism in the name of
                preserving great books and memorializing canonical authors in a
                neutral, technocratic archive divorced from the increasingly
                politicized campuses of the free speech era and the subsequent
                culture wars. Despite the fact that librarians and archivists
                have often been allies of the American cultural left, many early
                digital humanities initiatives seemed to aspire to be apolitical
                in their orientation. It could be argued that the digital
                humanities was also surprisingly slow to consider the
                implications of what Judy Wajcman calls "TechnoFeminism" by
                interrogating the masculinist ideologies of technology itself. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">This issue of <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> indicates that a sea change may finally be
                taking place. Recent high-profile blog posts by Bethany
                Nowviskie about gendered language at the heart of the NEH’s
                "Digging into Data Challenge" and from Miriam Posner about
                brogrammer code culture that privileges literacies that exclude
                women have finally catalyzed more serious discussions about the
                possibilities of creating a field of feminist digital
                humanities. Amy Earhart and Julia Flanders remind the DH
                community that collections and archives from nascent women’s
                studies departments often provided impetus for many early
                digital humanities projects. Rising scholars in the #transformDH
                movement are also bringing queer theory, transgender
                perspectives, and posthumanism into public discussions about
                inclusion and exclusion in DH.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">But where would the field of Feminist DH locate its core values?
                How can it be more than simply anti-masculinist in its
                orientation? Criticizing the obvious fetishizing of tools, code,
                competition, and "massive" or "big" data projects is one thing.
                Doing field-building work is another. Furthermore, how would
                feminist DH be specifically feminist in its theoretical
                grounding rather than merely oriented toward improving access
                and equity for women in DH? What does it mean to rethink
                rule-based systems and user agency from a feminist perspective
                and then apply the worldview of feminist game studies to the
                work of the digital humanities? According to Carolyn Guertin,
                subjectivity under feminism "becomes a process and a performance
                that is constantly in a state of redefining its own complexity
                according to a network of power formations" (2009). What would
                it mean to move from a paradigm of tool development to a
                paradigm of process and performance in which the network of
                power formations moves from ground to figure? </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Nina B. Huntemann defines feminist game studies as a field that
                focuses on "how gender, and its intersections with race, class,
                sexuality, etc., is produced, represented, consumed and
                practiced in and through digital games" (2012). Huntemann, like
                many feminist game scholars, is also interested in the
                genealogies of computer games, and their origins in a
                computational media history shaped by military training,
                surveillance technologies, and the exercise of force by the
                power of the state [<a class="ref" href="#huntemann2010">Huntemann and Payne 2010</a>]. Feminist digital
                artists who deploy game technologies, as Anne-Marie Schleiner
                does in her <cite class="title italic">Counterstrike</cite> intervention
                    <cite class="title italic">Velvet-Strike</cite> or Char Davies does by
                using 3D graphics with a head-mounted display in her immersive
                installations, may explicitly promote forms of user interaction
                that defy command-and-control tactics and subvert expectations
                that the user should obliterate obstacles and occupy territory.
                Although some scholars have pointed out how digital humanities
                projects borrow specific technologies of geospatial mapping
                developed for the user interface of flight simulators [<a class="ref" href="#presner2008">Presner 2008</a>], knowledge-sharing between the military and the digital
                humanities often still takes place without comment. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Feminist approaches to videogames and virtual worlds have
                included a range of approaches that explicitly borrow from
                feminist methodologies in ethnography, human-computer
                interaction, science and technology studies, media arts
                practice, and textual criticism. It is worth noting that many of
                these fields are now only beginning to be referenced in the
                scholarly literature of the digital humanities. Many current
                scholars of computer games and virtual worlds – such as Beth
                Coleman, Mary Flanagan, Tracy Fullerton, Celia Pearce, Emily
                Roxworthy, and Katie Salen – also identify as designers and
                bring their experiences as creative professionals with
                prototyping, workflow management, iteration, and user-testing to
                the field. Even if they don’t identify as designers, many in
                feminist game studies identify strongly as players or power
                users of videogames. For example, Mia Consalvo, Lisbeth
                Klastrup, Bonnie Nardi, Carol Stabile, T.L. Taylor, and Jill
                Walker Rettberg have pursued advancement within in-game
                reputation systems, and their scholarly ethos as game scholars
                seems to be enhanced by having progressed from apprenticeship to
                mastery in particular games, as evidenced by their achievements,
                hours logged, and the fame of their avatar names. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Many debates in the digital humanities recall debates already
                rehearsed in game studies. For example, significant cohorts of
                digital designers, programmers, and architects must collaborate
                and compete with those who identify exclusively as critics and
                theorists within the research community. Questions about which
                group can speak with the most authority in public fora can be
                difficult to resolve, particularly when plainspoken discourse
                and highly technical skills prized by builders and makers are
                devalued by the academy. Much as DH purists have called for
                "more hack, less yack" or lionized "builders," designers of
                classic games are often the keynote speakers at game conferences
                and serve as celebrity attendees. However, it may be reasonable
                for digital humanities projects to also consider how certain
                power users intent on exploring collections for hours at a time
                can provide specialized input about system design, much as
                attention to "hardcore gamers" in game studies may provide
                insights about the co-creation of knowledge.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">There are a number of useful insights to be gained in the digital
                humanities from observing how feminist game studies gained
                legitimacy in an environment devoted to machismo mastery and
                performance. Feminist game scholars have done important work on
                protocols, market forces, technoculture, datification,
                instrumentalism, opportunism, and online aggression, as well as
                on appropriation, domesticity, reciprocity, collective agency,
                community building, and empathy. They have also successfully
                built networks, collectives, and collaboratives. However,
                feminist game studies also benefited from the fact that during
                the past three decades feminist scholarship transformed both
                science and technology studies and film and television studies.
                Feminist scholars of literacy, programming, and cultural studies
                including Anne Balsamo, Wendy Chun, Radhika Gajjala, N.
                Katherine Hayles, and Lisa Nakamura used critical frameworks
                that reconfigured ideas about bodies, machines, affect, and
                labor and applied analytic methods formerly reserved for art and
                literary texts to technological discourses, such as those around
                reproductive medicine or computer science. At the same time, the
                contributions of scholars such as Mary Anne Doane, Anne
                Friedberg, Linda Williams, Lisa Parks, Lisa Cartwright, and
                Teresa de Lauretis exerted a major influence on the field of
                media studies by shifting the focus of critical practice from
                text and discourse to matters of the apparatus, technosocial
                environments, embodied experiences, and the interfaces and
                platforms of mediation.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Obviously, to take game studies seriously in the digital
                humanities presents a number of disciplinary, methodological,
                and practical problems. Game studies scholars often situate
                themselves as participant-observers rather than disinterested
                critics or archivists and reject poses of depersonalized
                neutrality. Game interfaces are characterized by the intentional
                frustration of easy user access by the game’s designers. In
                contrast, interfaces for digital humanities projects – search
                engine portals, hyperlinked pages, timelines, maps, or
                visualizations are supposed to be unambiguously user-friendly.
                Players are expected to risk failure as they solve puzzles and
                explore dead ends, which is a key part of game play, rather than
                zip through transparent navigation into the assets of core
                databases. In fact, the pleasure of a game play experience can
                often be attributed to its lack of predictability,
                replicability, and even stability. Furthermore, the attitudes of
                gamers often focus on celebrating acts of individual hacking
                meant to gain personal advantage rather than creating universal
                standards through deliberative processes dictated by
                professional associations. Feminist games may prove to be doubly
                transgressive in design. For example, in <cite class="title italic">The
                    Path</cite> by the Belgian game collective Tale of Tales,
                going directly to grandma’s house ends the game in failure
                immediately; you need to go into the woods, develop sexually,
                and risk danger among the wolves in order to have any hope of
                gaining knowledge of the game world.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">To position oneself as a feminist can also be difficult in the
                context of participating in civil discourse in digital culture.
                In the mid-nineties cyberfeminist critics promised that new
                forms of social relations constituted by user-generated content
                on distributed networks would reshape existing architectures
                that defined gendered power relations, but now many who study
                social network sites, computer games, and virtual worlds contend
                that it is difficult to mount resistance against a neoliberal
                agenda promoted by the very design of infrastructures and
                interfaces upon which our technologically mediated existence
                depends [<a class="ref" href="#gajjala2012">Gajjala and Oh 2012</a>]. Furthermore, although
                identifying as a feminist critic can be an act of solidarity
                with like-minded others, lines of inquiry in game studies that
                challenge the dominant culture can also risk exposure to the
                rhetorical violence of anti-feminist online affinity groups, as
                Mia Consalvo points out: 
            <blockquote><p>While I was writing this piece, for example, a Canadian blogger
                created a game where one can punch and bruise the face of Anita
                Sarkeesian, creator of the popular website <cite class="title italic">Feminist Frequency: Conversations with Pop Culture</cite>
                [<a class="ref" href="#spurr2012">Spurr2012</a>]. The game was in response to news of her
                Kickstarter campaign, where she proposed investigating
                portrayals of women in videogames over the past few decades. The
                game was only the latest in a string of attacks on Sarkeesian
                for her proposed project: she also received death threats, had
                her Wikipedia page defaced with pornographic imagery, and was
                repeatedly harassed on the Kickstarter page and
                elsewhere.</p></blockquote></div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Much as feminist bloggers have been victimized by Internet
                harassment for taking a stand against particular forms of
                aggressive online conduct accepted as normative, feminist game

                the hypermasculinity of existing user behavior. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">To understand the landscape of feminist game studies it may be
                helpful to look at the prototypical collaboration of Ludica, a
                group of four feminist game scholars (Janine Fron, Tracy
                Fullerton, Jacquelyn Ford Morie, and Celia Pearce) who took
                turns presenting their collectively authored papers at game
                conferences throughout the world. The group wrote a paper for
                the Digital Games Research Association that generated
                considerable controversy among that research community by
                calling attention to what they called "the hegemony of play"
                that defined the user population of computer games too narrowly
                and ignored large populations of supposed "non-gamers" who
                actively played online card games or participated in virtual
                worlds that focused on clothing or social interaction. In this
                call to action Ludica envisioned a three-pronged systematic
                critique of existing scholarship and design research around
                games that would encompass "1) the production process and
                environment for the creation of digital games; 2) the
                technologies of play, including the evolution of games from folk
                traditions and cultural artifacts to industrial products and
                intellectual property, and now to digital products and virtual
                societies; and 3) the cultural positioning of games and
                'gamers'"  [<a class="ref" href="#fron2007">Fron et al. 2007</a>]. They noted biases of age and race
                as well as biases of gender in how games and gamers were counted
                and defined. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">What currently constitutes the "big data" digital humanities may
                be similarly charged with ignoring large contingents of archival
                practitioners by virtue of how their labor may be gendered and
                valued, especially given the long pre-digital history of
                low-status librarianship in schools and communities and the
                tendency for men to occupy managerial positions in more
                prestigious libraries [<a class="ref" href="#golub2010">Golub 2010</a>]. Certainly, only the largest
                city libraries, such as the New York Public Library, are
                sufficiently capitalized and connected for participation in
                NEH-scale digital humanities research projects, while local
                librarians must focus on their service as infomediaries who help
                clients navigate the user-interfaces of computer databases and
                locate and interpret sources that meet their needs [<a class="ref" href="#ramirez2009">Ramirez, Parthasarathy, and Gordon 2009</a>]. Ironically, city and school libraries are also more
                likely to have the game and social media functions of their
                computer networks curtailed by government regulators intent on
                users only accessing high-status approved sites for purposes of
                legitimated research labor [<a class="ref" href="#losh2012">Losh and Jenkins 2012</a>]. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">To think about the "small" data digital humanities for a moment,
                it might be useful to look at the function of niche audience
                websites like The Library Observatory, an open-submission Tumblr
                blog, where users can "post screenshots of quirks in data from
                the Digital Public Library of America," such as cataloging typos
                or sloppy metadata parameters, which have been made visible by
                The Library Observatory’s main digital humanities visualization
                site operated by Harvard’s metaLAB. Just as "mess" is an
                important category for feminist HCI researchers [<a class="ref" href="#dourish2011">Dourish and Bell 2011</a>], it also might be important in the small data
                digital humanities, where the foibles of manual labor might be
                made manifest by chuckles in the blogosphere over the bejeweled
                and manicured hand of a female digitizer accidentally appearing
                in the Google Book Search results for <cite class="title italic">The

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">Collaborative scholarship has been an important practice among
                intersecting groups of feminist game scholars. For example,
                Ludica’s Pearce also served as a coauthor of <span class="hi italic">Ethnography and Virtual Worlds: A Handbook of Method</span>,
                along with Tom Beollstroff, Bonnie Nardi, and T.L. Taylor. This
                handbook not only emphasizes the important contributions of
                feminist ethnography to our understanding of digital culture but
                also criticizes the instrumentalism, quantification, and
                subsequent myopia of the scientific rationalism that derides
                subjective, personal, or embodied perspectives. Yet
                collaborative authorship in the digital humanities cannot be
                similarly strongly correlated with feminism. Only one of the ten
                authors of the critical code studies book <cite class="title italic">10
                    PRINT</cite> was female, and women made up only a fraction of
                the multiple authors of the "crowdsourced" book from the
                University of Michigan Press <cite class="title italic">Hacking the
                    Academy</cite>. Perhaps this is not surprising given the
                machismo sometimes associated with multiple authorship in other
                forms of digital textual collaboration, such as when hackers
                generate code or Wikipedia editors produce pages or computer
                scientists rack up publications with the multiple authorship
                that defines their scholarly networks. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Yet feminists can make distinct contributions by providing
                opportunities for digital humanists to think across disciplines,
                particularly to consider how the literature of the social
                sciences or of the digital arts can trouble the simple model of
                coding knowledge promulgated by the humanities computing
                paradigm. After all, to visit a digital archive as a remote user
                still involves accessing, browsing, reading, and wayfinding. In
                particular, contemporary researchers in human-computer
                interaction point to the importance of considering how
                embodiment or identity is experienced by computer users who are
                engaged in computer mediated practices of telepresence or
                ubiquity, and feminist game scholars have led in their
                discipline on these issues. For example, Taylor asserts that
                designers should "rise to the challenge presented by a sociology
                of the body" ([<a class="ref" href="#taylor2006">Taylor 2006</a>, 124]). </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">In <cite class="title italic">Communities of Play</cite>, Pearce focuses on
                how inhabitants of virtual worlds understand their own social
                construction of identity and experience intersubjectivity.
                Pearce uses feminist ethnography to ground her research on
                members of the "<em class="emph">Uru</em> diaspora" of players
                who were forced to recreate their familiar 3D world in new
                platforms after the game was discontinued, much as participants
                in many digital humanities initiatives must cope with choosing
                between the options of "emulation" or "migration" when hardware
                or software that supports a beloved project becomes obsolete.
                She observes that "feminist ethnography has long challenged
                boundaries between subjectivity and objectivity, individual and
                society, researcher and subject, fact and faction, self and
                other, and art and science" [<a class="ref" href="#pearce2009">Pearce 2009</a>, 21]. It is worth
                noting that successful digital humanities projects often
                encourage imaginative identification with other times and places
                and allow the visitor to become a participant in historical
                narratives. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Although feminist game studies is still a relatively new area of
                inquiry, it also benefits from opportunities to reflect on its
                own intellectual history. Looking back to the work of Sherry
                Turkle on the shift in the mid-1980s away from hard mastery and
                toward "soft" forms of computer use in which
                "the computer is
                still a tool but less like a hammer and more like a harpsichord" in Turkle’s words (63), Mimi Ito argues that gaming is much like
                other domains of digital mastery in that user behavior can’t be
                reduced to a "feminine" stance of "soft" engagement that might
                only reinforce gender norms (147). In contrast, Mary Flanagan
                feels like she can build on the work of feminist pioneer Brenda
                Laurel in seeing herself as a "culture worker" capable of
                "conscious interventions" that foster
                "action styles" that offer
                "models for other emerging practices"
                and "sites of empowerment"
                to marginalized groups (256). Of course, the promotion of
                feminist game studies has to do with the agencies of peers as
                well as the existence of progenitors, so perhaps this issue of
                DHQ will serve as an important early step in field building.</div>
