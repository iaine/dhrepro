                <p>This article traces the history of Storyspace, the world’s first program for creating, editing and reading hypertext fiction. Storyspace is crucial to the history of hypertext as well as the history of interactive fiction. It argues that Storyspace was built around a topographic metaphor and that it attempts to model human associative memory. The article is based on interviews with key hypertext pioneers as well as documents created at the time.</p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Michael Joyce has kept a journal for many years. Before he begins to write, he
                inscribes the first page with an epigram: "Still flowing". As anyone who has read
                Joyce’s fictions or critical writing will attest, his work is replete with multiple
                voices and narrative trajectories, a babbling stream of textual overflow interrupted
                at regular intervals by playful, descriptive whorls and eddies. If there is a common
                thread to be drawn between his hyperfictions, his academic writing and his novels,
                then it is this <em class="term">polyglot dialogue</em>, as Robert Coover terms it — a lyrical
                stream of consciousness. Joyce can tell a story. And he has told many stories: four
                books, forty scholarly essays, and at last count (my count), a dozen
                    fictions.<a class="noteRef" href="#d10195e206">[1]</a> What courses through this
                work is a gentle concern, or even fixation, with how stories are told, with "how we make meaning, as if a caress"
                 [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2004">Joyce 2004</a>, 45]. The metaphor of water is an appropriate one.
                Like Ted Nelson, who had his first epiphany about the nature of ideas and the
                connections between them as he trailed his hand in the water under his grandfather’s
                boat, Joyce has long been concerned with how to represent a multiplicity of ideas
                and their swirling interrelationships, with how stories change over time. In the
                essay "What I Really Wanted to Do I Thought",
                about the early development of Storyspace, Joyce writes: <blockquote><p>What I really wanted to do, I discovered, was not merely to move a
                        paragraph from page 265 to page 7 but to do so almost endlessly. I wanted,
                        quite simply, to write a novel that would change in successive readings and
                        to make those changing versions according to the connections that I had for
                        some time naturally discovered in the process of writing and that I wanted
                        my readers to share. [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1998">Joyce 1998</a>, 31]
            </p></blockquote>

                 , the world’s first hypertext fiction [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1987">Joyce 1987</a>]. The
                development of Storyspace is, at least in part, the story of Joyce’s quest to find a
                structure for what did not yet exist, or as he wrote in a lengthy document created
                at the time called the Markle Report (see note on sources<a class="noteRef" href="#d10195e240">[2]</a>), to find "a structure
                editor...for creating 'multiple fictions'
               " 
                [<a class="ref" href="#bolter1986">Bolter and Joyce 1986</a>, 12].</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">As I have argued elsewhere,<a class="noteRef" href="#d10195e292">[3]</a> the early hypertext systems were built to embody particular visions about
                how the human mind and memory work, to represent the "complex interconnections" that
                hold between ideas. Each system (re)presented a different model of these
                interconnections and of the perceived complexity underlying a mass of information.
                As Jay David Bolter put it in 1991, "electronic symbols...seem to be an extension of a
                network of ideas in the mind itself" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#bolter1991">Bolter 1991</a>, 207] (also cited by [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1998">Joyce 1998</a>, 23]).
                Storyspace is no exception; Joyce intuitively felt that stories disclose themselves
                in their "connectiveness," and that "we are associative creatures. That’s what we
                do" 
                [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>]. Unlike the hypertext pioneers van Dam, Engelbart, Nelson or
                Bush, however, Joyce is first and foremost a writer – and Storyspace was designed
                for writers. The image of potentiality that guided Joyce was consequently a literary
                one; it started with an idea for a novel.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In every interview Joyce has given about <cite class="title italic">afternoon</cite> or the
                development of <cite class="title italic">Storyspace</cite>, the leitmotif of a "story that
                changes each time you read it" returns like a Wagnerian melody. Joyce’s writing is
                filled with such recurrences, with images and phrases that return again and again;
                "recurrence is the sounding of memory in air," he writes in <cite class="title italic">Othermindedness</cite> 
            [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2004">Joyce 2004</a>, 97]. As Stuart Moulthrop observed in response to this
                article, the name "Joyce" is also an echo, "an echo he won’t acknowledge for
                fear of trading on homonymity" 
                [<a class="ref" href="#moulthrop2011">Moulthrop 2011</a>]. Joyce, keen as always to create a
                self-reflexive eddy in the text, has a response to that response)<a class="noteRef" href="#d10195e351">[4]</a>. This particular image, the image of a multiple fiction, is important enough
                that it appears verbatim or near verbatim in many of his essays on hypertext (e.g.,
                [<a class="ref" href="#joyce1998">Joyce 1998</a>, 31] 
            [<a class="ref" href="#bolter1991">Bolter 1991</a>, 247] 
            [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2004">Joyce 2004</a>, 123] as a "multiple" story). </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Although he is quick to point out that "it wasn’t a matter of just bringing a set of
                ideals and aspirations to Bolter," and then building a system to do that [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>],
                the idea of a novel that changes with each reading was obviously important to him,
                based on its longevity in his own work. In our interview, he actually corrected my
                phrasing: "forgive this, this is like an English teacher, it’s not 
                    <em class="emph">every</em> reading in the sense of every different reader, but I said <em class="emph">each</em> reading, and I had in mind readers who would go back to
                a text again and again" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>]. If Storyspace has an origin legend, then it begins
                with this multiple fiction; in Vassar College’s version of the tale, Joyce "looked
                at his little Apple II in the early 80s and said I’ll bet you could do a story
                that would change every [sic] time you read it. He called around, looking for such
                software, and it didn’t exist" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#vassar1992">Vassar College 1992</a>].
                Apocryphal stories aside, what is clear is that as a novelist, Joyce was thinking
                about the process of writing, and even more importantly, about the internal
                connections that exist in stories - connections that might, with the aid of a
                computer, be shaped by potential readers.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In the early 80s, as a classics professor working at the University of North
                Carolina, Chapel Hill, Jay David Bolter was also thinking about the computer as a
                writing space, and about the connections that hold between ideas. His department had
                been pioneering research into the computerization of classical scholarship since
                1975, led by David Packard (son of billionaire computing pioneer David Packard, Sr.,
                the co-founder of Hewlett Packard). Unlike his contemporaries, and crucially for the
                future of humanities computing, Bolter had a background in computer engineering. He
                completed a Masters in Computer Science in 1978 as well as a PhD in Classics in
                1977, both from UNC, and he was a member of the Committee for Computer Applications

                storyworld. It was a world simulator, and this world included the characters that
                lived in it and their goals and motivations. TALE-SPIN behaved, in effect, like an
                author’s memory. It had to keep track of these characters and their specific
                environment, access the material, and reformulate the narrative based on these

                profound influence over hypertext theory and criticism, and also the Storyspace
                system; from the outset, the nodes in Storyspace were called "writing spaces," and
                it worked explicitly with topographic metaphors, incorporating a graphic "map view"
                of the link data structure from the first version, along with a tree and an outline
                view (which are also visual representations of the data). "The tree," Bolter tells

                topographic metaphor, writing spaces in Storyspace acted (and still act) as
                containers for other writing spaces; an author literally "builds" the space as she
                traverses it, zooming in and out to view details of the work, the map making the
                territory. This is an important point. "The whole thing about Storyspace was – the

                to repeat terms and nodes throughout the work and have them reappear in new

                ideas as nodes, move them into "spatial" clusters, and link them into an associative

                Storyspace fictions are. WE would assemble the nodes in sequence and print a linear
                document. If the user edited this tree structure, then the structure of the
                corresponding printed document would change. The model was derived from a review of
                the literature in cognitive psychology, composition theory, and the nascent field of
                Human Computer studies (this would become HCI). Bolter coauthored a seminal paper on

                seen. This concept was invented by Bernstein, and eventually made its way into the
                Mosaic browser (Eastgate never implemented breadcrumbs in Storyspace). Possibly for
                this reason, Bernstein was initially more interested in signing Joyce’s hypertext
                fiction, <cite class="title italic">afternoon,</cite> than he was in Storyspace. As Joyce

                thought this was overstating the situation. He remembered approaching Joyce about

                fact that it bridged the gap between humanities and computing science so early, and
                that it was taken seriously by both fields. This was largely due to the fact that
                Bolter "had a seat in both worlds," as Joyce points out, collaborating with
                his engineering colleagues from the outset [<a class="ref" href="#joyce2011b">Joyce 2011b</a>]. Unlike Nelson and Engelbart, Bolter and
                Joyce were not ridiculed; on the contrary, they both felt embraced by computing

                Joyce, "what has gone unremarked is Storyspace’s contribution to a dialogue, if not
                across the two cultures then at least across the engineering and literary

                        recent book, <cite class="title italic">Mechanisms</cite> (2008), "The single indespensible source for the
                        early history of Storyspace is Joyce and Bolter’s report to the Markle
                        Foundation, which funded Storyspace for a crucial development year in 1985"

                        Report"). The Markle Report was written during the first development cycle
                        for Storyspace, and describes both the research process behind the program
                        and the tool itself as it was used at the time over 60 typed pages; for this
                        reason, I will be relying heavily on it. That said, human memory is
                        fallible, but so are documents. The Markle Report was written mainly by
                        Joyce, and in the manner of any document assembled in haste and addressed to
                        a funding body, it presents a particular view of the task at hand (and
                        sometimes gets the minor details mixed up).<br/><br/>
               As Joyce put it when I

                        own petard, but obviously I wrote the whole Markle Report; my imprecisions

Eastgate’s role in stewarding Storyspace is well-known, and has been documented by scholars... My chapter, however, concerned an even earlier period in the software’s
development, based largely on the archival materials housed at the Ransom Center. Whatever our disagreements, I have, and have always had, much respect for Mark Bernstein’s contributions to hypertext and his role in that community.</p></blockquote> (personal email to the author, 2012).</div><div class="endnote" id="d10195e1658"><span class="noteRef">[29]</span>
