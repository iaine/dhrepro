            <p>The past decade has seen a remarkable proliferation of new works of constrained and appropriated writing that prominently incorporate, and in turn investigate, metadata schemes. I argue that these works ought to be of considerable interest not only to critics of contemporary avant-garde writing — but also to media theorists, librarians and textual scholars. By emphasizing classification protocols, conceptual writing makes an implicit case for the interrelationship of these fields. Each of the four main books under discussion here — Tan Lin’s <cite class="title italic">Seven Controlled Vocabularies</cite>, Craig Dworkin’s <cite class="title italic">Perverse Library</cite>, M. Nourbese Philip’s <cite class="title italic">Zong!</cite> and Simon Morris’ <cite class="title italic">Getting Inside Jack Kerouac’s Head</cite> — draws upon pre-existing textual archives. In doing so, these books suggest that processes of data storage, classification and transmission are key to how poetry is created, recognized and disseminated. Conceptual writing’s attention to information classification protocols offers not only a critique of contemporary models of authorship, but also of contemporary frameworks of personal agency and intellectual property. </p>

               In the past one hundred years, people in all lines of work have jointly constructed an incredible, interlocking set of categories, standards, and means for interoperating infrastructural technologies. We hardly know what we have built. No one is in control of infrastructure; no one has the power centrally to change it. To the extent that we live in, on, and around this new infrastructure, it helps form the shape of our moral, scientific, and esthetic choices. Infrastructure is now the great inner space.

         <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">We are, it could be said, in the midst of a metadata revolution. By the term <em class="term">metadata revolution</em>, I mean to describe the extraordinary proliferation of powerful online catalogues and finding tools. The most obvious player in the metadata revolution would be Google, but in a larger sense most current media distribution platforms — Amazon, eBay, Facebook, iTunes, Mediafire, Pirate Bay, Youtube, library.nu — operate as gigantic catalogs. We have entered into a new age of cataloging and data aggregation at every level of society: governments, corporations, universities and individuals have access to unprecedented quantities of data, and they require metadata to access, classify, and prioritize that data. The effects of the metadata revolution are too complex to detail here; without doing full justice to the concept of a metadata revolution, this paper examines recent works of conceptual writing which foreground questions of classification. In what follows I hope to show that conceptual writing ought to be of interest to media theorists, librarians and textual scholars — as well as to critics of contemporary avant-garde writing. By emphasizing classification protocols, conceptual writing makes an implicit case for the interrelationship of these fields. Each of the four main books under discussion here — Tan Lin’s <cite class="title italic">Seven Controlled Vocabularies,</cite> Craig Dworkin’s <cite class="title italic">Perverse Library</cite>, M.

Marjorie Perloff (who in other contexts has been supportive of digital poetries) has recently written:
         <blockquote>
               <div class="ptext">E-poetry never quite got off the ground, the compositional process of an e-poem (however much animation might be used) not being essentially different from that of a "normal" print poem.</div>
               <div class="ptext">The revolution that soon occurred was not in writing for the computer screen but writing in an environment of hyperinformation, an environment, moreover, where we were all authors. [<a class="ref" href="#perloff2010">Perloff 2010</a>, xi]
               </div>
            </blockquote>
         </div>
         <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Notwithstanding her abrupt dismissal of e-poetry, Perloff makes an important observation about what she calls "poetry by other means in the new century." This new poetry takes much of its content, as well as many of its constraints, from the "environment of hyperinformation." Even if it does not take the end form of <em class="term">e-poetry</em> (the designation is problematically general and already sounds obsolete), conceptual poetry relies heavily on recent technologies such as email, blogs, Facebook, search engines, Twitter, iPad apps and data visualization programs.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3428e272">[2]</a> Much of this writing is profoundly self-conscious of processes of remediation and transcoding. Collectively these works demonstrate a distinct fascination among poets with the "organization of knowledge."
         </div>
         <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The most widely cited definition of metadata — "data about data" — is clearly inadequate: information could be said to be data about data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3428e324">[3]</a> In information theoretical terms, data is the most basic form of signification — thus any organized data could be construed as metadata. If we qualify our definition, as the <cite class="title italic">OED</cite> does, by requiring that metadata be "a set of data that describes and gives information about other data," then we come closer to a useful definition. In the collection <cite class="title italic">Introduction to Metadata</cite>, Anna Gilliland suggests that a "useful, 'big picture' way of thinking about metadata is as the sum total of what one can say about an information object at any level of aggregation," and she defines "an information object" as "anything that can be addressed and manipulated as a discrete entity by a human being or an information system" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#gilliland2008">Gilliland 2008</a>, 2]. According to the recent volume <cite class="title italic">Metadata and Semantics</cite>, "Metadata can be defined as structure data about an object that supports some function(s) related to that object described, achieving a degree of uniformity in description by means of schemas. Metadata schemas are structured representations of information for a given use or domain…." 
            [<a class="ref" href="#lytras2009">Lytras and Sicilia 2009</a>, v]. Although metadata is typically associated with digital artifacts, the term need not be restricted to digital contexts. According to Stephen Ramsay,
         <blockquote><p>[T]he seeds of the modern computerized database [are] fully evident in the many text-based taxonomies and indexing systems which have been developed since the Middle Ages. Whenever humanists have amassed enough information to make retrieval (or comprehensive understanding) cumbersome, technologists of whatever epoch have sought to put forth ideas about how to represent that information in some more tractable form. [<a class="ref" href="#ramsay2004">Ramsay 2004</a>]

         </div>
         <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">As tractable as those forms may be, they are never value-free. Johanna Drucker has recently written that "metadata schemes must be read as models of knowledge, as discursive instruments that bring the object of their inquiry into being, shaping the fields in which they operate by defining quite explicitly what can and cannot be said about the objects of a particular collection or online environment" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2010">Drucker 2010</a>, 11].</div>
         <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Analogues to a number of claims made in this paper can be found in recent writing on data visualization, and in particular within Lev Manovich’s influential notion of <em class="term">the database logic</em> of new media <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#manovich2004">#manovich2004</a></span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3428e389">[4]</a> Expanding upon Manovich’s account, Mitchell Whitelaw’s essay "Art Against Information: Case Studies in Data Practice" argues:<blockquote><p>Manovich suggests that one of the roles of data art is to reflect on data subjectivity; I would go further and say that data art is involved in the construction of that subjectivity…. It pulls us away from information, from the well-formed messages that dominate our experience of digital media. [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2008">Whitelaw 2008</a>]
            </p></blockquote>
         </div>
         <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Conceptual writing similarly asks us to reflect upon, as well as reconstruct, patterns of "data subjectivity." Poetry, as the literary genre linked most closely to expressions of direct, "authentic" subjectivity, presents a particularly rich forum for exploring the construction of personhood. Metadata has an important role to play in Whitelaw’s account of the potential of data art to reconfigure notions of subjectivity:
         <blockquote><p>By directing us instead towards data, [data art] opens spaces for potential, for the distributed reconstruction of information. Yet in the process it invariably encodes its own metadata — data about data — that can be read out through the artists’ processes, as this paper has demonstrated. This metadata must in turn inform us as data subjects, if we are to move past immersion and navigation to a more critical, and active, agency. [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2008">Whitelaw 2008</a>]
            </p></blockquote>
         </div>
         <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Whitelaw offers an optimistic appraisal of data art, and I believe much the same could be said of conceptual writing. All of the works surveyed in this essay thematize in some manner the relation of the writer to a data set, and these works raise important questions concerning privacy, authenticity and identity. These works are not necessarily, for the most part, directly prescriptive of social change. They could even be said to take the form of parodic compendia — substituting reclassification and remediation for direct expression. </div>
         <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">The title of Kenneth Goldsmith and Craig Dworkin’s <cite class="title italic">Against Expression</cite> 
            [<a class="ref" href="#dworkin2011">Dworkin and Goldsmith 2011</a>] suggests an outright rejection of traditional notions of poetic sincerity and lyric confession — or what is often described as the individual poetic "voice." This rejection of expression is clearly aimed at the creative writing establishment — as an overarching rubric, however, it is somewhat misleading. The writings of Goldsmith and Dworkin themselves (as I have argued elsewhere) are often surprisingly personal.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3428e442">[5]</a> Perloff suggests that "Paradoxically, this new citational and often constraint bound poetry — a poetry as visually and sonically formalized as it is semantically charged — is more accessible, and in a sense, 'personal' than was the Language poetry of twenty years earlier" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#perloff2010">Perloff 2010</a>, xi]. Conceptual writing acknowledges its debt to Language poetry, and, like Language poetry, attempts a critique of a naturalized poetic voice. But the critique is not so much of expression <cite class="title italic">per se</cite>, as it is of either the <em class="term">naturalization</em> or the <em class="term">industrialization</em> of expression. Language poets of the 1970s challenged direct poetic expression at the level of syntax, arguing that even poetic language was inherently ideological.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3428e468">[6]</a> Conceptual writing continues that critique of poetry as direct expression, but it does so with a new awareness of the extraordinary changes brought about by digital technologies in the past two decades.</div>
         <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Many of the practices explored in this essay have their origins in 1960s conceptual art.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3428e484">[7]</a> Dan Graham’s 1966 "Poem-Schema," its creator claimed, "defines itself in place only as information" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#graham2009">Graham 2009</a>]. The writings of Vito Acconci, Lawrence Weiner, Lucy Lippard, Sol Lewitt and others could be cited as exemplifying conceptual art’s interest in information technologies and the representation of "raw" data. What is different about conceptual writing of the past ten years — according to proponents including Perloff, Goldsmith, Dworkin, Fitterman and Place — is (in Goldsmith’s words), "the sheer quantity of language" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#dworkin2011">Dworkin and Goldsmith 2011</a>, xviii] made available by the emergence of the Internet. "Digital media," according to Goldsmith, "has set the stage for a literary revolution" 
            [<a class="ref" href="#dworkin2011">Dworkin and Goldsmith 2011</a>, xvii]. Whether or not Goldsmith’s rhetoric is hyperbolic, conceptual writing exists in a kind of dialectical tension with recent developments in information technology — depending on improvements in information storage and dissemination for much of its content, and yet at the same time remaining attached to the print book as its dominant vehicle.</div>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">Lin describes his work as an "ambient poetics," about which he writes "[Today] a work architecture [or film] or [poem] or [novel] should have as fluid and standardized an ID [OBJECT ID™ SYSTEM] as possible and function like a waiting area, time slot, universal market/currency or metadata standard" 
                   [<a class="ref" href="#lin2010c">Lin 2010c</a>, 131]. Lin is clearly mocking the rhetoric of genre hybridity, but he is also pointing out that in an era of media convergence, poetry, while it may evade a specific use value, is still implicated with homogenizing systems of distribution and classification. Lin’s ambient poetics acknowledges its place with a hypermediated society, and yet attempts to resist being instrumentalized in the interests of any single cause or subject matter. For Lin, "A book should be the weakest information pattern that is visible to the eye. Only in that way can it outlive its data" 
               [<a class="ref" href="#lin2010c">Lin 2010c</a>, 130]. A book is, of course, in many ways one of the strongest information patterns with which we are familiar — compared to electronic documents, the book is a relatively stable artifact. By emphasizing the metadata protocols of the book as physical object, Lin subverts the unit of the poetry book, and by extension places poetry within a far wider discursive field. That field also extends beyond American Written English, as well as beyond categories such as Asian American and Chinese American. Lin has even made a Google translation of <cite class="title italic">Seven Controlled Vocabularies</cite> available on lulu.com. No pretense is made of it being an authoritative cross-cultural document. Lin’s output over the past several years has been prodigious: there are a number of companion volumes to <cite class="title italic">Seven Controlled Vocabularies</cite>: an entire <cite class="title italic">Appendix</cite> volume, a critical reader, a book of blurbs, a book of mini-essays, and even a handmade book. Lin has made collaboration a key feature of his work — in the "EDIT: Processing Network Publishing" event at Penn in which Lin participated last year, for instance, different media technologies were employed to produce work on site. One product (or byproduct perhaps) of the event was the volume (available as a pdf and as a Lulu print-on-demand book) <cite class="title italic">Selected Essays About a Bibliography</cite>edited by Danny Snelson. The book features mini-essays by nearly fifty contributors; among the contributions are two essays titled "Metadata." One essay, credited to Kareem Estefan, simply reprints the definition provided by the National Information Standards Organization. The other essay, by Dan Visel, explores paratexts, such as book covers, as forms of metadata. According to Visel, "A book is not a text. It’s more than a text. It’s a text and a collection of information around that text, some of which we consciously recognize and some of which we don’t"

The book comprises a bibliography of 2,247 works, as well as a remarkable forty-page introduction entitled "Pinacographic Space." Pinacography, or the compiling of lists, derives from the <span class="foreign i">Pinakes</span>, or tables of learning, compiled by Callimachus at the library of Alexandria. According to Alex Wright, in his <cite class="title italic">Glut: Mastering Information Through the Ages</cite>, "this elementary bibliographic constituted the first systematic abstraction of metadata" 
               [<a class="ref" href="#wright2007">Wright 2007</a>, 73]. Dworkin offers an exhaustive description of his library, but at the same time his entire project recognizes the difficulties of classifying and describing a physical library. The book includes two bibliographies, "A Perverse Library" and "The Perverse Library" — the difference between the definite and indefinite article presumably denoting books the author would like to own as opposed to those the author actually does own. Dworkin’s fundamental classificatory choice is to group his books by publisher. He acknowledges that he has not provided a complete bibliography of his library — many titles, particularly those of mainstream publishers, are excluded. The effect of this is to present the reader with an extraordinary cornucopia of recent avant-garde writing.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">There is something of a voyeuristic show-and-tell feel to a personal pinacography — perhaps that is part of what Dworkin means by the perversity of the project. On the one hand, many of the likely readers of this book will look for books they own or have written. On the other hand, this book has induced me to buy a number of books I otherwise would not have, and in this sense the book could be said to have a strikingly direct effect on its readers. Dworkin hardly mentions electronic publication in his introduction, but it is clearly a specter haunting the book. Dworkin is no technophobe, and has made much of his library available online at his Eclipse website. He has even extensively theorized his own practices as an online archivist.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3428e704">[11]</a> In some sense, <cite class="title italic">The Perverse Library</cite> shows that no amount of metadata can stand in for the sensory data of physical books. The book could almost be taken as a refutation of Goldsmith’s "If it isn’t on the internet, it doesn’t exist" — except that ironically the maxim almost holds true in that almost all of these books are online, in the sense that it is possible to find instantaneous metadata, including prices and library access information, about nearly all of these titles.

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Dworkin both celebrates and laments the physical space taken up by the library. He insists his project is an architectural one, a documentation not simply of the library’s textual contents, but also an account of its materiality. In his introduction, Dworkin engages in an extended excursus on the olfactory aspects of his library — a form of sense data seldom recorded bibliographically. The catalog presents us with a paradox — it makes information accessible, but it also deforms it through reducing it to fixed categories. Dworkin’s book could be the most compelling single volume account of small-press Anglo-American poetry publishing over the past few decades, and yet it does not contain a single image. Despite its seeming copiousness, it is a radically reduced representation of these objects and those persons and institutions that produced them. The title suggests a sexualized relation of the bibliophile to his books, but etymologically the word "perverse" — in the sense of <em class="emph">through verse</em> — could also be considered entirely appropriate to a poetry library. </div>

Philip’s printer introduces what Benzon calls "the standardization of error" into the text of <cite class="title italic">Zong!</cite>. The malfunctioning printer resists the protocols of a clean, direct presentation of text. Writing of Andy Warhol’s <cite class="title italic">Aa: A Novel</cite>, Benzon suggests that "At both the microscopic and the macroscopic levels, the systematization of textual production that inhered in the typewriter and elsewhere in the office influenced writing and reversed its effects" 
                   [<a class="ref" href="#benzon2010">Benzon 2010</a>, 96]. It is perhaps more difficult to introduce serendipitous errors into computer texts than typescripts, and it would seem even more difficult to encounter such errors in works which are extensively copyedited for publication. According to Benzon, "Each typed document, each piece in the massive archive of postwar corporate discourse, is a unique record of an individual sequence of body-machine interfaces and technological inscriptions" 
               [<a class="ref" href="#benzon2010">Benzon 2010</a>, 96].

               [<a class="ref" href="#coolidge1982">Coolidge 1982</a>, 29]. Lists can mark absences also, as for instance in Maya Lin’s 1981 Vietnam Memorial, which arranges the names of the dead not alphabetically but chronologically by date of death.

               [<a class="ref" href="#belknap2004">Belknap 2004</a>, 3]. The formal organization of lists and inventories suggests order and coherency, but that organization can also display the injustices of classifications based on flawed conceptual principles.</div>

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">Morris’ choice of cover designs could hardly have been accidental. But what does he mean by the book’s title? It could be interpreted as an ironic critique of what Daniel Belgrad calls the mid-century "culture of spontaneity" 
                  [<a class="ref" href="#belgrad1998">Belgrad 1998</a>]; it could also be taken as suggesting that the process of recopying is a more active form of reading, allowing greater insight into the mindset of an author. But given the hypermediated nature of the <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite> text(s), as well as of Kerouac’s persona, how can an act of remediation get Morris (or Morris’ readers) into Kerouac’s head? Importantly, <cite class="title italic">Getting Inside Kerouac’s Head</cite> involves at least two remediations — from printed book to blog, and from blog to détourned book. The book reprints (nearly) the exact pages of the <cite class="title italic">Original Scroll</cite> book, only in reverse order. Thus it is possible to read the entire text of the <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite> scroll (book), word for word, simply by turning the book’s pages to the right rather than to the left. Although the book and the blog may contain exactly the same (or nearly the same) words, they are very different works. Morris, it should be noted, reproduces the lineation and exact formatting of the original scroll book — although occasionally slight variations in lineation can be noted. He also reproduces Kerouac’s errors exactly, as for instance "jaloppy" on the first page [<a class="ref" href="#kerouac2007">Kerouac 2007</a>, 109].</div>
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">After considerable, but not exhaustive, examination, I have found only a few minor errata in Morris’ "transcription", but those errata demonstrate that retyping the book was a labor of love, rather than simply a scanned version of the original (which to the casual observer would appear identical). The most conspicuous erratum is in the book’s first sentence. Howard Cunnell, the editor of the <cite class="title italic">Original Scroll</cite>, has preserved a double met in the famous first sentence of the book: "I first met met Neal not long after my father died. . ." 
                  [<a class="ref" href="#kerouac2007">Kerouac 2007</a>, 109]. Morris does not preserve the double met. According to Cunnell, the double met was "preserved because it so beautifully suggests the sound of a car misfiring before starting up a long journey" 
                  [<a class="ref" href="#kerouac2007">Kerouac 2007</a>, 101]. Whether or not this is the case, it is unlikely that Kerouac would have preserved such an error. Morris may have inadvertently corrected the redundancy. Aside from several other errata (a reversed quotation mark on page 291, which can also be found in the blog’s November 29, 2008 entry; a missing sentence on page 269; some missing text on page 275), Morris (and Thurston as editor) appear to have carried out an extraordinarily careful transcription — contrary to what one might expect from a blog as a casual form of instantaneous publication.</div>

The book features an expanded introduction by Goldsmith. The introduction is worth quoting at length, since it bears on the book’s genesis, as well as its meaning:
         <blockquote><p>A few years ago I was lecturing to a class at Princeton. After the class, a small group of students came up to me to tell me about a workshop that they were taking with one of the most well-known fiction writers in America. They were complaining about her lack of imagination. For example, she had them pick their favorite writer and come in next week with an "original" work in the style of that author. I asked one of the students which author they chose. She answered Jack Kerouac. She then added that the assignment felt meaningless to her because the night before she tried to "get into Kerouac’s head" and scribbled a piece in "his style" to fulfill the assignment. It occurred to me that for this student to actually write in the style of Kerouac, she would have been better off taking a road trip across the country in a ‘48 Buick with the convertible roof down, gulping Benzedrine by the fistful, washing ‘em down with bourbon, all the while typing furiously away on a manual typewriter, going 85 miles per hour down a ribbon of desert highway. And even then, it would’ve been a completely different experience, not to mention a very different piece of writing, than Kerouac’s. [<a class="ref" href="#goldsmith2008">Goldsmith 2008</a>, 142–143] 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#morris2010">Morris 2010</a>, vii]
                  </p></blockquote>
               </div>
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">Morris’ appropriation of this paragraph provides an ingenious "unoriginal" point of origin for his project. As a repudiation of creative writing pedagogy, Goldsmith’s provocation is rather standard fare. More interestingly, Goldsmith is proposing a radically mimetic way of producing (or reproducing) a literary text — requiring not merely the rewriting and rereading of the text, but the attempted reconstruction (or imitation) of the author’s total writing experience. Setting aside for a moment the playfulness (and impossibility) of Goldsmith’s Borgesian pedagogical strategy, he makes an important point about how "very different" the student’s piece of writing would be from Kerouac’s. Although Goldsmith trots out familiar clichés of <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite>’s composition, as anyone who has read the <cite class="title italic">Original Scroll</cite> edition knows, many of those clichés are false. Kerouac claimed not to have used Benzedrine while working on the scroll. Kerouac made no secret of his dissatisfaction with the 1957 version of <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite>, but he did not claim the scroll was the text to be preferred. He worked on editing the book for six years after producing the scroll, and there are two extent subsequent typescripts by his hand that incorporate substantial changes. Not only are there divergences between the scroll and the 1957 text, there are also letters and journals Kerouac used in composing the book. In effect, to choose a text of <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite> is a matter of choosing at what point in time one wants to get inside of Kerouac’s head. One commentator [<a class="ref" href="#hunt2009">Hunt 2009</a>] has even suggested that <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite> should be considered primarily an oral text, a form of "typetalking." Goldsmith’s snapshot account elides much of this process — his syntax suggests that Kerouac was typing while driving (and drinking!). Goldsmith emphasizes the bohemian dimension of the book, rather than the three weeks in which Kerouac composed the scroll in his mother’s apartment, or the complex collective editorial process that led to the 1957 text.</div>
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">One effect of the scroll text is that it de-novelizes <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3428e1236">[15]</a> By using real names, the book becomes a more direct record of Kerouac’s experiences. The scroll text is more homoerotic and more misogynistic; it is, in the words of its editor, Howard Cunnell, "a markedly darker, edgier, and uninhibited text than the published text" 
                  [<a class="ref" href="#kerouac2007">Kerouac 2007</a>, 31]. Perhaps the scroll text does allow readers to get further into Kerouac’s head, but the many layers of mediation and irony in the presentation of Morris’ project would seem to suggest the difficulty of undertaking such a telepathic procedure by textual means. Consider for instance this exchange (<a href="#figure16">Figure 16</a>) between Morris and a fan of his blog, Jannie Sue "Funster" (a real person so far as I can ascertain):</div>
               <div id="figure16" class="figure">
                  <div class="ptext"><a href="resources/images/figure16.png" rel="external"><img src="resources/images/figure16.png" alt=""/></a></div>

               <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">There is a healthy dose of English sarcasm in Morris’ grin, but there is also politeness and empathy. Jannie Sue’s identification with the project is seemingly at odds with the heroic masculinity typically associated with the book. In fact, Kerouac misspelled LuAnne Henderson’s (Neal Cassady’s first wife’s) name throughout the scroll (in the 1957 Viking edition she is known as Mary Lou). Jannie’s identification is predicated on a mistaken homology, and yet her tragic reading of the novel is to my mind oddly more accurate than the conventional pop cultural reading of the novel as a celebration of bohemian escapism. Why shouldn’t Morris share Jannie Sue and Kerouac’s sense that "everybody’s got this broken feeling"? Perhaps that is just as authentic a response to the book.</div>
               <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">Is Morris being sincere when he suggests that "chewing on Kerouac’s words is the most thrilling read/ride of my life"? Retyping one page per day of someone else’s novel into a blog would hardly seem thrilling — in a sense it is the inverse of Goldsmith’s notion of vicariously retracing Kerouac’s journey. Morris seemingly goes nowhere beyond his keyboard. He makes no direct comment on the textual and cultural morass that is <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite> — rather he unimagines (and perhaps even re-personalizes) what by now can only be read as a collective text, a product of millions of readings. The blog — the most democratic and derided of publishing formats, as well as perhaps the easiest means by which to violate copyright online — is a fitting venue. Kerouac’s legendary typing skills are returned to the bureaucratic regimens from which they emerged. To add another ironic dimension to Morris’ project, the Kerouac estate has for decades been extremely protective of Kerouac’s letters and unpublished manuscripts. Morris has thus republished a document that for over fifty years was unavailable to readers. <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite> provides ample proof of Jerome McGann’s claim that "Every document, every moment in every document conceals (or reveals) an indeterminate set of interfaces that open into alternate spaces and temporal relations" 
                  <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#mcgann2001">#mcgann2001</a></span>. Whereas <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite>’s marketing has largely sold readers on the prospect of getting inside Kerouac’s head, Morris’ project rejects an unmediated entry into the psyche. Though Kerouac’s writing process was often frenzied and sporadic, <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite> took nearly ten years of sustained effort to reach print. Morris’ rewriting, by contrast, takes the form of a daily ritual practice. Every post indicates the date and time of its posting. For some twenty minutes each day, Morris could be said to conduct a devotional exercise within the highly regimented chronological format of the blog.</div>

                  [<a class="ref" href="#morris2010">Morris 2010</a>, xii].

If Morris’ project pushes at the boundaries of fair use (or fair dealing in the UK), it would be a rich irony to accuse him of copyright violation. Exactly fifty years after its composition, the scroll sold for $2.4 million, setting the world auction record for a literary manuscript [<a class="ref" href="#block2001">On the Block 2001</a>]. The scroll’s consignor was Tony Sampas, the nephew of Kerouac’s third wife, Stella Sampas, the presumed forger of the will. The winning bidder was James Orsay, owner of the Indianapolis Colts, who although he owns the physical manuscript, is not listed as a copyright holder of the book version of the scroll. As a result of the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of 2008, the 1957 text of <cite class="title italic">On the Road</cite> will remain under copyright in the United States until the year 2052 (95 years from the date of its first publication). <cite class="title italic">The Original Scroll</cite> edition will be copyright until 2102.

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">The readings of Lin, Dworkin, Philip and Morris that I have suggested here could be extended to encompass a broader range of recent writing; I would mention in particular the writing of Robert Fitterman, Monica de la Torre, Kenneth Goldsmith, Vanessa Place, Kim Rosenfield, Caroline Bergvall, Nicholas Thurston, Matthew Timmons, Derek Beaulieu and Ara Shirinyan — although this list (or meta-list) is far from complete. Recent avant-garde writing from the US, UK, and Canada has a near obsession with classification. The Listmania found in this writing challenges a passive acquiescence to the cataloguing procedures we experience every day. Perhaps avant-garde poetry has transferred itself from the prison house of language of the 70s and 80s to the prison house of classification in the Internet era. In saying this, I recognize that I am awkwardly assigning agency to a number of overlapping historical categories. The writers under discussion in this paper are careful not to assume simplistic correlations between metadata schemes and ideology (or politics). Though these works suggest that we are captives of classification, they do not necessarily claim that we are deterministically imprisoned by our classifications. To adapt the prison house metaphor, perhaps the door of the Bastille has been open for a while. Contrary to enduring myth, only seven prisoners were freed in the storming of the Bastille. This makes it no less important as an event, or rather no less important as a shifting series of events, images, descriptions and (re)categorizations.</div>
