                <p>This is a review of a collection of essays by rhetoricians and writing studies researchers examining the intersections and affinities between rhetoric and the digital humanities. Edited by Jim Ridolfo and William Hart-Davidson (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2015), this volume is a valuable effort to sustain a conversation across these important fields. The essays that make up this collection are relevant to both titular fields, and to a wider range of writing and English studies scholars.</p>

           <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The twenty-three chapters that make up <cite class="title italic">Rhetoric
                    and the Digital Humanities</cite>, edited by Jim Ridolfo and
                William Hart-Davidson, represent the first book-length effort to
                sustain a conversation around the affinities between these two
                fields. Though only "rhetoric" is included in the title, this
                volume really speaks more broadly across writing
                studies — rhetoric, composition, computers and writing, and
                technical and professional writing. The theoretical and
                methodological conundra worked through in the chapters
                (especially demonstrated through specific project applications)
                are important first steps toward what will hopefully be a more
                sustained engagement between the digital humanities and writing
                studies. On the whole, the volume should be read by the writing
                studies community, especially as an introduction to the tools
                and methods employed in the digital humanities that might be of
                use to their research. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Yet, it might be slightly less obvious at the outset what digital
                humanists outside of rhetoric and writing studies might gain
                from reading the volume. Part of the confusion may arise from
                the tone of the introduction. Citing an increased level of
                investment in the digital humanities, both within institutions
                and through external funding agencies, Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson
                begin their introduction by calling on Matthew Kirschenbaum’s
                "Digital Humanities as/is a Tactical Term" to argue that
                rhetoric and writing studies scholars can leverage DH in two
                ways:
            <blockquote><p>First, we argue that scholars may want to consider selectively
                redefining digital projects under the umbrella of DH in order to
                leverage funding, institutional recognition, and extrafield
                audiences, Second we propose studying the DH job market as an
                example of how fields in crisis (literary studies and history)
                are responding to market pressures and, additionally, how
                rhetoric studies can leverage DH for additional hires. [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 4]</p></blockquote></div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">This is pragmatic, to be sure. However, one might imagine
                beginning this volume not with concerns of funding and
                disciplinary legitimation, but rather with a vision of how the
                two titular fields can be more mutually constitutive. Ridolfo
                and Hart-Davidson work toward this vision at
                the end of their introduction, especially when they sketch the
                many lines of inquiry animating the contributions of the volume.
                The fourteen bullet points that close the introduction indeed
                look both ways — toward how rhetorical theory can inform DH praxis
                and how DH methods and theories can be adopted and adapted to
                rhetoric and writing studies research. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Perhaps the stance Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson begin with is merely
                reactive to a less productive version of conversations between
                writing studies and the digital humanities: what Shannon Carter,
                Jennifer Jones, and Sunchai Hamcumpai call a territorial
                dispute, pitting computers and writing scholarship against
                digital humanities scholarship in a struggle over who was here
                and who said what first [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 36–37].
                The pragmatic opening may be an effort to shake stubborn
                computer and writing scholars from their defensive positions
                into a more open dialogue. Some chapters in the volume still
                stake territorial claims — DH should recognize certain kinds of
                work as DH scholarship (Sano-Franchini), or rhetoric and writing
                programs should be cautiously defensive in the face of
                institutional pressures to conform/contribute to DH initiatives
                (Walls) — but the stance throughout is more productive, and more
                reflective of the fourteen rich questions with which Ridolfo and
                Hart-Davidson end their introduction.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The volume is divided into three sections. In Part One,
                "Interdisciplinary Connections," the authors take up relations
                between rhetoric and the digital humanities, seeding new
                conversations by providing frameworks for digital humanities
                work (Reid; Sano-Franchini; Anderson and Sayers), examining
                fruitful ground for collaboration (Brown; Carter, Jones, and
                Hamcumpai; Eyman and Ball), and advocating for DH methods to be
                taken up in rhetoric (Johnson). At times, though, there seem to
                be assumptions or misunderstandings about the digital humanities
                within the chapters. For example, James Brown Jr. seeks to draw
                a parallel between the current relations between rhetoric and
                the digital humanities and past disciplinary struggles within
                English departments between rhetoric/writing studies and
                literature faculty. In doing so, Brown paints a monolithic
                portrait of the digital humanities as literary criticism. His
                discussion of electronic literature and software studies is
                compelling: arguing that the "procedural rhetoric" of electronic
                literature is a potential point of interrogation for
                rhetoricians to "theorize the relation between production and
                interpretation" [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 29]. However,
                his larger point about the disciplinary identity of the digital
                humanities elides scholarship outside of literary studies
                (especially history, geography, and the public humanities). </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Despite possible mischaracterizations, Part One outlines some of
                the potentials for rhetorical theory to inform approaches to
                digital humanities work. In particular, Sano-Franchini’s
                "Cultural Rhetorics and the Digital Humanities: Toward Cultural
                Reflexivity in Digital Making" is a timely effort that can speak
                to the transformative and postcolonial digital humanities
                initiatives of scholars like Roopika Risam, Moya
                Bailey, and others. Sano-Franchini employs a "cultural
                rhetorics" approach, which "theorizes how rhetoric and culture
                are interconnected through a focus on the process by which
                language, texts, and other discursive practices like
                performance, embodiment, and materiality create meaning"
                 [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 52]. In so doing, she provides
                a heuristic for the creation of multimodal texts and the
                metadata associated with those texts from a cultural rhetorics
                viewpoint. Her heuristic is also a powerful call for
                rhetoricians moving toward digital representations to be
                reflexive to how metadata and underlying data structures can
                affect projects, often in unforeseen ways. Sano-Franchini’s
                chapter is representative of the best the volume has to
                offer — contributions that look both toward DH and back upon
                rhetoric and writing studies to imagine a mutually beneficial
                relation. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Nathan Johnson’s chapter, "Modeling Rhetorical Disciplinarity:
                Mapping the Digital Network," the last chapter in Part 1, is the
                first in the volume to take up quantitative methods. Johnson
                argues for the use of factor mapping in the humanities for
                tenure and promotion. According to Johnson, with factor mapping,
                humanities scholars can leverage "one of the more powerful argumentative
                rhetorics of the twenty-first century — the use of mathematics to
                support an argument"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 100]. He
                closes his chapter with an interesting discussion of metadata:
                "Even though full-text analysis is possible for humanistic
                interpretation, perhaps some of the richest types of metadata
                for factor-mapping projects are the subject headings,
                classifications, descriptors, and keywords associated with
                primary and secondary texts. This type of information is
                frequently generated by human interpretation, usually by
                librarians or indexers who are hired specifically to interpret
                the nature of books" [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 105–106].
                Here, the humanistic aversion to quantitative data that Johnson
                identifies is mitigated through the mediation of library
                metadata practices. Johnson’s chapter could certainly provide a
                starting point for further research and also provides a nice
                transition to Part Two, "Research Methods and Methodology."</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The volume may ultimately be most useful for rhetoricians and
                writing studies scholars as a primer or introduction to DH
                methods as they have been (or could be) applied. Johnson’s
                contribution is the first instance of this type of text, and
                Part 2 of the volume provides a wide range of projects and
                methodological discussions that anchor the volume. Johnson’s
                focus on quantitative, computer-aided methods is mirrored in
                contributions by Kennedy and Long, Hart, Hoffman and Waisanen,
                and Koteyko. Likewise, McNely and Teston’s "Tactical and
                Strategic: Qualitative Approaches to the Digital Humanities"
                should be required reading for almost any DH researcher, but
                especially those coming newly to DH from rhetoric and writing
                studies. Their warning bears quoting in full since the history
                of methodological appropriation in rhetoric and composition runs
                deeply: "rhetorically informed digital humanists should proceed
                with caution — <em class="emph">doing</em> DH is not as simple as
                choosing a digital tool and then combining that tool and tactic

                analysis – and one particular tool – DICTION – as relevant to
                rhetorical research. Hart briefly discusses some findings of
                DICTION, a proprietary, commercial text analysis tool, which, he
                admits, are not shocking unless "one remembers that they were
                unearthed by a machine" [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 161].
                Perhaps the most useful of Hart’s contributions here is to
                temper what he calls the positivistic and humanistic
                overreactions to automated text analysis [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 154]. Recalling the work of Jerome McGann
                and Stephen Ramsay (deformative/algorithmic criticism), Hart
                argues that DICTION, by employing a bag-of-words approach to
                documents, can "make the text strange" in ways that readers are
                unlikely to do on their own [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 158]. For her contribution, Koteyko critiques text analysis

                networked) aspects of a text in ways that rhetoricians coming

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">In a slight departure from automated and computer-assisted
                analysis, Boyle’s "Low Fidelity in High Definition: Speculations
                on Rhetorical Editions" takes on scholarly markup and digital
                editions: topics rarely discussed in rhetoric and writing
                studies writ large (even in computers and writing, the subfield
                that shares the most obvious affinities to the digital
                humanities). As such his chapter is an important initial foray
                into this long-standing branch of DH work. Boyle argues that
                literary digital editions in DH privilege a "fidelity to texts
                and interpretation" while a rhetorical edition would
                "re/construct texts as dynamic situations, confusing the
                primary, secondary and tertiary" [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 132]. Boyle’s understanding of digital editions created in
                DH comes largely from Stephen Ramsay’s algorithmic criticism,
                but he also mentions Jerome McGann’s "idea of radiant
                textuality" [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 132]. It is
                surprising, then, that Boyle ascribes such stability and
                fidelity to digital critical editions. One can see the theory of
                a dynamic and unstable text Boyle lauds as uniquely rhetorical
                in Jerome McGann’s "The Rationale of Hypertext," originally
                written in the mid-1990s and republished in his 2001, <cite class="title italic">Radiant Textuality</cite>. McGann writes, 
            <blockquote><p>Unlike a traditional edition, a hypertext is not organized to
                focus attention on one particular text or set of texts. It is
                ordered to disperse attention as broadly as possible. Of course
                it is true that every particular hypertext at any particular
                point in time will have established preferred sets of
                arrangements and orderings, and these could be less, or more,
                decentralized. The point is that the hypertext, unlike the book,
                encourages greater decentralization of design. Hypertext
                provides the means for establishing an indefinite number of
                "centers," and for expanding their number as well as altering
                their relationships. One is encouraged not so much to find as to
                make order — and then to make it again and again, as established
                orderings expose their limits.  [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann2004">McGann 2004</a>, 71]</p></blockquote></div>
