                <p>My paper contains original "Word Processor Art" compositions and an
                    explanation of the theoretical grounding for my work. I compose visual images
                    (comprised of words primarily taken from advertisements about the object they
                    construct) in a program not intended for that purpose (Microsoft Word). I break
                    from the expected form of the "Word Processor Document" to scrutinize how
                    machines, especially computer programs and the graphical user interface (GUI),
                    influence the consumer's utilization of computers. In particular, my project
                    questions how machines influence users' thinking and how the
                        "user-friendly" inhibits creativity. The process disassembles the
                    notion of "user-friendly" as a transparent influence and reveals how media
                    shapes the author's imagination and creations.</p>

                <p>The ever-present PC, in many ways, parallels the presence of the typewriter in
                    the 1950s, 60s and 70s, which led artists to experiment with the grid-like form
                    of mechanical type to create concrete and, eventually, dirty concrete poetry. My
                    work is inspired by these artists and the typewriter poetry they composed. My
                    work also references art collective JODI's compositions and how our contemporary
                    society resists the limitations of the GUI.</p>

                <p>My intent is to draw attention to the media of the composition. My work disobeys
                    the prompts of the GUI to emphasize the idea that pre-packaged programs elicit
                    conditioned responses and stifle genuinely creative uses of computing devices.
                    Nietzsche writes that "our writing tools are also working on
                        our thoughts" (quoted in [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1986">Kittler 1986</a>, 200]). My
                    purpose in producing this work is not a rejection of computing or the GUI, but
                    to draw attention to an interface’s existence and influence on its user. My work
                    points to a creative space outside of conditioned responses to the GUI.</p>
            </div>
            
        
        
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Nietzsche writes that "our writing tools are also working on our
                    thoughts" (Nietzsche, cited in [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1986">Kittler 1986</a>, 200]).
                Avid users of technology justify their reliance on technology, because they believe
                that these devices facilitate, speed, strengthen, or seemingly eliminate the
                unnecessary or unproductive from commonly occurring activities. However, this
                relationship between the user and the device is anything but one-sided. Rather, a
                user begins to anticipate the exclusion of these processes, trading cognition for
                output. Nietzsche’s observation translates to the 21st century: our digital tools
                work on our thoughts, and the result is undesirable. The standardization of
                    "user-friendly" and its seemingly invisible presence teaches its users,
                through inculcation, to respond to machines' prompts. Users engage particular
                programs for prescribed purposes and anticipate a predictable type of product.
                Contemporary, American, techno-centric culture accepts the incredibly specific role
                    "creators," the makers of machines and their programs, design for consumers
                of computers. The constant exposure to media as tools for communication and
                expression dulls creative thought processes by training users to simply respond as
                the program's designers expect. This does not have to be the case.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">In the following paper, I disobey the conventions of Microsoft Word to demonstrate
                that, despite the corporate intention of its marketers, the controlled ways users
                interact with their machines need not be obstacles to creative thought; rather,
                these mechanisms, programs and the Graphical User Interface (GUI), can serve to
                assist in the creation of new forms of expression. In my project, I create visual
                images out of words, using a program not intended for that purpose (Microsoft Word).
                By breaking from the expected form of output, which resembles what I am creating in
                this text, I ask the audience to scrutinize how machines, especially the GUI of
                modern computers, limit the consumer's creative utilization of computers. The GUI
                utilizes visual icons (trash cans, menus, etc.) as an electronic platform through
                which users interact with technology in lieu of command-line interfaces. My work
                questions how the manufacturers’ notion of "user-friendly", both through
                programs and the GUI, deliberately inhibits creativity in the effort to create
                passive, unthinking consumers, who use uniform products in predictable and
                prescribed ways. Resisting this level of corporate control, I manipulate a program
                in ways not intended by its creators. By fighting limitations inherent in the
                average consumer’s personal computing experience, I disassemble the notion of
                    "user-friendly" as a transparent and benign influence. Rather, digital
                tools, which <em class="emph">should</em> aid the user, hazard becoming potentially
                disruptive censors, which discourage exploration of the digital page and stifle the
                author’s creative imagination.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The first digital poetry surfaced in the 1950s and surged with the emergence of the
                personal computer in the 1980s. As digital compositions evolved from the printed
                page to include generative, kinetic, interactive, and multimedia work, these pieces
                continued to rely on the computer screen as a space for composition. Since my work
                draws much inspiration from the work of concrete and dirty concrete poets, my poems
                rely on the "shaping of the poem [as] an embodiment of its
                    content," or in some cases as the foil of its content [<a class="ref" href="#funkhouser2007">Funkhouser 2007</a>, 13]. This qualifies my work as what Christopher
                Funkhouser names static visual digital poetry. He states that <blockquote><p>
                    Static works – or poems that do not move – are made from one
                        of two distinct approaches: they are either shaped by an artist (presented
                        to readers in print or in an exhibition setting) or built as
                        viewer-activated work (viewed onscreen or printed out). Digitally rendered
                        poems portray at least three different traits: words are arranged into
                        literal shapes; words show patterns that represent dispersal or displacement
                        of language; or words are combined with images (as in a collage). 
                     [<a class="ref" href="#funkhouser2007">Funkhouser 2007</a>]
                </p></blockquote></div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">I shaped my work as a static presentation, meant to be viewed, not altered, by the
                reader. The "literal shape" of my compositions alters the way in which the
                reader engages with both the text and image, and draws attention to how form and
                content intertwine. Rather than simply reading the words that make up my
                compositions, a reader must grapple with the shape the poem has taken. According to
                Funkhouser, the diverse body of static visual poetry relies on both shape and text
                in its composition, but engages with the visual and textual in widely different
                    ways.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8747e251">[1]</a> My own work expands on the body of currently existing visual digital poetry,
                through my method of selecting and arranging textual material. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5"> On the most basic level, my poems purposefully layer media to deconstruct the
                marketed purpose of their medium (Word Processor). Their new construction creates a
                place where printed advertisements, physical objects, producer intentions, interface
                restrictions, and user creativities collide. First and foremost, my poems undermine
                the comfortable and familiar constraints of the word processor. Instead of using
                Word to compose the expected products (8.5 x 11 inch page after page), I imitate
                hacker-typewriter artists of the dirty concrete movement like Steve McCaffrey, bp
                Nichol, John Riddell, and Robert Zend, who relied on the grid of the typewriter page
                as a canvas for their creations. Much like these authors reimagined the grid of the
                typewriter page as a place where typographical rules might or might not apply, I
                envision the digital page as a place for something other than prose
                compositions.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">In my own compositions, I draw attention to the limitations and requirements of the
                computer as media and the word processor as a program, when it is obeyed. As I
                deviate from the expected format, a remarkable number of red, green, or blue
                squiggly lines alert that my composition has not behaved well. Spellchecking and
                grammar warnings initially mar these reconstructions. Becoming an unfriendly user, I
                click through layers of menus and disable the bulk of the surface-level constraints
                Microsoft Word imposes and continue composing.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7"> Distributers prime consumers to be receptive to their product long before it is ever
                in their hands. That is, consumers use a product in the way producers instruct them
                to use it; they color within the lines. In order to simplify production, minimize
                user error, protect copyrights, and make money, producers standardize not only their
                products, but also the marketed uses of these products. They eliminate access to the
                product’s inner workings to promote only particular utilization of the machine. They
                teach their consumers obedience, which <cite class="title italic">The Oxford English
                    Dictionary</cite> defines as "compliance with or performance of a command, law,
                        etc."
                     [<a class="ref" href="#obedience">OED Online</a>]. The producers of a machine rely on the willingness of its customers to
                comply with the marketed use of the machine and its applications, in order to
                achieve a product that universally appeals. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8"> By disobeying machines' prompts, a creator can use constraints as a source of
                inspiration to rediscover a space for creativity that has long been ignored, in lieu
                of mass-marketed, user-friendly technology. My compositions criticize the media’s
                self-promoted user-friendliness by using its original product advertising as the
                foundation of each poem. I reassemble old advertisements, articles, and instruction
                manuals in the two dimensional shape of the product on the pages of a word
                processor. Visual icons and rhetorical devices, meant to seduce the user into
                    "properly" using this newly available technology, confront the user in this
                new construction, which takes shape in a program intended for prose-like
                compositions. In <cite class="title italic">Media Parasites in the Early

                    of media" requires one to "(ab)use media technologies… in the system in a way not
                        intended by hegemonic powers"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#niebisch2012">Niebisch 2012</a>]. Rather than conforming to the expectations of the digital page, one ought to
                defy them. This deliberate, albeit limited, subversion demonstrates the author’s
                awareness of processes behind the most accessible interface. Working against these
                constraints creates opportunities to think critically in forgotten, invisible
                spaces, and to shirk off the often unacknowledged influences of user-friendly.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9"> But why resist these constraints in this way? Well-meaning producers of products,
                who want to sell lots and lots of their products, inhibit (intentionally or
                unintentionally) the creative uses of their products by stressing their
                user-friendliness and cutting off the user’s access to the product’s inner workings.
                Although this logic follows from a marketing standpoint (why <em class="emph">not</em>
                protect the interests of the company through copyrights and closing off the
                system?), it involuntarily circumvents the machine’s processes, writing them off as
                necessary and seamless. The old adage, "It’s about the journey, not the
                    destination" surprisingly simplifies what should be obvious to the consumer.
                In always skipping to the end, the user misses opportunities for creation and
                innovation. In his chapter "The Unworkable Interface",
                Alexander Galloway revises McLuhan’s idea that the "medium is
                    the message", writing: <blockquote><p class="ptext">Politics thus reveals why the door or window theory of
                            the interface is inadequate. The door-window model, handed down from
                            McLuhan, can only ever reveal one thing, that the interface is a
                            palimpsest. It can only ever reveal that the interface is a reprocessing
                            of some other media that came before. </p>
                        <p class="quote"> On this point I will be absolutely clear; a palimpsest the interface may
                            be; yet it is still more useful to take the ultimate step, to suggest
                            that the layers of the palimpsest themselves are "data" that must
                            be interpreted. To this end, it is more useful to analyze the intraface
                            using the principle of parallel aesthetic events, and to claim that
                            these parallel events reveal something about the medium and about
                            contemporary life. [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2012">Galloway 2012</a>]</p></blockquote></div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Galloway stresses the idea that each "layer" of the medium reveals something
                about the culture in which that medium exists. If we are to follow the layers of
                traces that he describes, then we should expect to access some essential truth by
                sifting through the effaced, the constructed, and the erased. The fact is, consumers
                have been taught to accept that there is nothing to excavate below the surface of
                the GUI. The GUI masks the product’s processes under the guise of facilitation, not
                inhibition. Does this make the processes and programs of our computers and smart
                phones faster and more accessible? Sure. Do users feel like unimpeded, even
                liberated, creators, who need not be bogged down with the particulars of messy
                programming? Mostly. However, this compulsory system, which reveals nothing to the
                vast majority of users about what happens between input A and output Z, provides
                almost no opportunity for an individual who might find meaning in what occurs in
                between. That space is a missed opportunity to create, expand, and innovate, if the
                user is willing to fight the system rather than merely conform to conditioned
                expectations.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11"> Fighting the system is difficult, especially when the producers of the systems are
                working hard to make working with their products seem effortless. Galloway describes
                the artistic impulse of these programmers, stating "Today’s ludic capitalist is therefore the consummate
                        poet-designer, forever coaxing new value out of raw, systemic interactions
                        (consider the example of Google). And all the rest has changed to follow the
                        same rubric: labor itself is now play, just as play becomes more and more
                        laborious […]"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#galloway2012">Galloway 2012</a>, 29]. The overlap of work and play conflate our society’s ideas about the
                boundaries of those two worlds. To take Galloway’s example of Google further, if he
                is correct, then the makers of Google’s seemingly infinite algorithms, maps, search
                engines, etc. are the ultimate magicians. The data-mining, the prioritization of
                information, the masking of processes all disappear behind the blank white search
                page of Google. When users play, they supply user-generated content that producers
                need to develop and market a new product back to that very consumer. These moments
                of play become essential to development, production, and consumption. These
                interactions are camouflaged in the most accessible interface. As consumers, we
                consume the simplicity of the product. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12"> I designed my poems as easy to view, but tricky to read. The in-your-face simplicity
                of the GUI functions in a similar way. These compositions emphasize the presence of
                a GUI in the "user-friendly." They are products of the program in which (and
                artifacts from which) they were composed. If the observer interacts only
                superficially, casually observing the image with no interrogation of the words, the
                item remains "user-friendly." It appears a jumbled amalgamation of letters that
                presents a cohesive picture. With this approach, the composition remains merely
                visual, masking the meaning of its text. However, as the reader transitions to
                reading the project actively, work becomes vital to discovering what occurs
                underneath the most accessible interface. To marry the meaning of the text with the
                visual image it constructs, the reader must link words across gaps and lines,
                unearthing meaning along the way. The process of reading is necessarily enhanced and
                disrupted by the visual form of the composition. Funkhouser describes the experience
                of reading static visual digital poetry, stating "Reading the embedded text is not as fluid an experience as
                        reading it on a blank page without visual distraction. Readers are more
                        likely to scan the compacted version, receiving the language in bits and
                        pieces"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#funkhouser2007">Funkhouser 2007</a>]. This method of excavation rewards readers, as they work to link shape and
                content. In my compositions, this process reveals history about the product and its
                marketing. Much like Galloway’s layers of the medium, each layer of these
                compositions shows how producers portrayed, marketed, and utilized these machines.
                Moreover, the marketed uses of these first computers contrast starkly with the
                black-boxed programming inherent in many devices today.</div>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">In my composition "Simplicity (Apple II)," I focus on
                Apple's marketed simplicity: simple design, simple to use, and simple to purchase.
                When Steve Jobs introduced the Apple Macintosh in 1984, he designed his product with
                    "user-friendly" in mind. The Macintosh was the first personal computer
                marketed specifically for the masses. The Macintosh features a GUI, which allows the
                user to initiate computer processes by using a mouse to navigate the visual images
                on a virtual desktop, in lieu of textual commands.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8747e393">[2]</a> These substitutions allowed a user to master
                the machine with minimal training. For the shape of the poem, I imitate the profile
                of the Apple IIe that is on the cover of its user manual (see fig. 2). This
                photograph is white and tan, a single finger hovers over the keyboard. This image,
                reminiscent of Michelangelo’s "The Creation of Adam"
                suggests that humans have now stepped into the ultimate role of creator. This
                machine is developed as a divine extension of our own selves. For the text, I draw
                from three advertisements (Figures 3, 4, and 5). Each of these texts boasts the
                sophistication, user-friendliness, and simplicity of the machine. For example, in
                    "How to buy a personal computer," the advertisement
                states that <blockquote><p>
                    And kids of all ages are finding how much fun computers can
                        be, and have no time for TV once they’ve discovered Apple. The excitement
                        starts in your local computer store. It’s a friendly place, owned by one of
                        your neighbors. He’ll show you exactly what you can use a personal computer
                        for….
                     [<a class="ref" href="#howto1979">How To Buy a Personal Computer 1979</a>]
                </p></blockquote> The machine is so simple that kids can use it. It is such fun that it can
                replace passive entertainment of the television. Just as Galloway earlier suggests,
                the lines between work and play overlap in this medium. Instead of elevating this
                machine to perform solely adults' work or minimize it as a venue only for play, the
                user is encouraged to search instruction on "exactly what you
                    can use a personal computer for[,]" which includes programming, "expansion capability," and "a personal computer that can grow with you as your skill
                        and involvement grow"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#howto1979">How To Buy a Personal Computer 1979</a>]. Ironically, in this phase Apple celebrated Apple IIe as "the one you can program yourself. So there’s no limit to
                        the things you can do"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#howto1979">How To Buy a Personal Computer 1979</a>]. Shortly thereafter, Apple developed the Macintosh, which severely restricted
                the user's access to the system, starting a trend that made the GUI of its operating
                system nearly impermeable for the average user. </div>

                GUIs on the consumer. She points to the accepted and prevalent model, originating in
                the Macintosh, as a point of man’s exclusion from the functions of the machine,
                which the user accepts because of his illusion of control. She writes that: <blockquote><p>
                    "user-friendly" now takes the shape of keeping users
                        steadfastly unaware and uninformed about how their computers, their
                        reading/writing interfaces, work let alone how they shape and determine
                        their access to knowledge and their ability to produce knowledge. As Wendy
                        Chun points out, the user-friendly system is one in which users are, on the
                        one hand, given the ability to "map, to zoom in and out,
                            to manipulate, and to act" but the result is a "<em class="emph">seemingly</em> sovereign individual" who is
                        mostly a devoted consumer of ready-made software and ready-made information
                        whose framing and underlying mechanisms we are not privy to. However, it’s
                        not necessarily the GUI <em class="emph">per se</em> that is responsible for the
                        creation of Chun’s "<em class="emph">seemingly</em> sovereign
                            individual" but rather a particular philosophy of computing and
                        design underlying a model of the GUI that has become the standard for nearly
                        all interface design.
                     [<a class="ref" href="#emerson2013">Emerson 2013</a>]
                </p></blockquote> Modern personal computers rely on the popularized GUI model to cultivate the
                consumer's superficial relationship with the product. Instead of the user imagining
                what a computer might do and programming it to do so, that individual surveys the
                list of available, ready-made programs and uses one for its intended function. A
                user, for example, might not understand how a search engine like Google shapes his
                experience of information. This user might equate a search on Google to searching
                the entire internet (or the entirety of human knowledge, for that matter). Because
                of this assumption, he remains unaware of websites Google excludes from its database
                and oblivious to how Google presents and privileges information. Furthermore, the
                user gains access to this database by responding to the keyword prompt Google's
                search engine requires. The "user-friendly" design shapes how the user searches
                and filters his experience of information. In spite of the seemingly infinite
                expanse of information presented, the program limits the creativity of the user and
                the diversity of the resultant information. Emerson explains that "Without a fully open, flexible, and extensible
                        architecture, the home computer becomes less a tool for learning and
                        creativity and more a tool for simply ‘handling information’"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#emerson2013">Emerson 2013</a>]. User-friendly transforms into a tool of unquestioning passivity. Its systems
                stifle originality. The system allows users to control, access, and move
                information, but it trains the user to react to prompts. The user composes on word
                processors, calculates in spreadsheets, and draws in <cite class="title italic">Paint</cite>. And, since the use of these machines saturate our society (at
                the time I composed this, I had a PC, a tablet, and a smart phone within three feet
                of me), it is natural that the habit of interacting with these machines increasingly
                influences users’ cognitive processes and patterns.</div>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15"> The term user-friendly is of course loaded and slippery. It derives from consumer
                desires and creator requirements. Consumers want to be masters of their machines
                without feeling dumb or discouraged. Moreover, many resist investing the time,
                energy, or attention it requires to become experts. Computer corporations devote
                themselves to creating user-friendly GUIs and programs for their devices, which make
                the consumer believe that they control their product and that the device empowers
                the consumer. Creators construct the glossy illusion of user-friendly with intense
                labor. In a 1995 issue of <cite class="title italic">Forbes</cite>, an article titled
                    "New Hope for Computer Illiterates" cites the general
                manager of IBM personal systems division Richard Thoman's estimate that one in three
                personal computers taken home "fails"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pitta1995">Pitta 1995</a>]. This overwhelming failure rate motivated creators of personal computers to
                improve how the consumer both interacts with computers and anticipates interacting
                with computers.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16"> Creators devoted themselves to discovering how average consumers consume computers.
                Kelly Stapleton, leader of one of Microsoft’s "usability" think-groups cited in
                    "New Hope," says that her research division works
                towards understanding what types of frustrations "novice" users encounter while
                computing. She relates that "We found surprising things, like people doing budgets in
                        the word processor rather than a spreadsheet because the spreadsheet was too
                        intimidating"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pitta1995">Pitta 1995</a>, 89]. The article stresses that "It’s not enough to establish standards so that different
                        parts of a computer system can talk the same language. You have to get
                        inside the mind of the consumer and figure out how to make that language
                        intelligible to him, too"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#pitta1995">Pitta 1995</a>, 89]. In order to achieve "user-friendly," programmers watched consumers
                through one-way mirrors, product teams met for tens of hours with computer-using
                families, and companies fluxed telephone support lines. Designing computers that

                into personal computing. "New Hope" laments the "unfriendliness" of computers still experienced in 1995: <blockquote><p>
                    Mail merge lets Microsoft Word, the company’s popular word
                        processor, add names and addresses ‘instantly’ to a form letter. But there’s
                        nothing instant about mastering the feature: Walking a perplexed user
                        through mail merge typically takes 30 minutes. Computer pros might have
                        laughed off such problems a few years ago, when most computers sat in
                        offices that had in-house help. But now that the personal computer business
                        is moving to the home market, murky, quirky software and hardware can lose a
                        customer forever. Some marvel that consumers keep on buying, despite their
                        disappointments.

                </p></blockquote> The economic impetus of "user-friendly" certainly gained momentum in the
                1970s and 1980s, but the battle against "murky, quirky software
                    and hardware" waged on through the 1990s [<a class="ref" href="#pitta1995">Pitta 1995</a>, 88]. It continues today. In fact, Microsoft's redesign of the time-tried,
                user-trained, classic desktop has met mixed receptions. In response to complaints
                about Windows 8's user-unfriendliness, classicshell.net created a program, which
                simulates the previously existing, familiar PC desktop. Classic Shell boasts that it
                provides "free software that improves your productivity, enhances the
                        usability of Windows and empowers you to use the computer the way you like

                15 million downloads over four years. The threat of losing consumers, through a
                not-so-transparent GUI model, drives software development and determines the
                marketability of a machine. </div>

                resistance, Apple personifies its machine, dubbing the Macintosh 512k with a

                of the self. This extension draws exquisitely, speaks foreign languages with ease,
                and produces prodigious music with the click of a mouse. By focusing the user on the
                ease of navigating visual icons, the efficiency of the machine to produce specific
                output becomes to the focus of the personal computer, not the adaptability for
                personal use.</div>

                more universally user-friendly, the system of variables must be closed. Creators
                need to standardize the production of computers and their components and relegate
                users to their place as interchangeable parts of the system. The concept of
                conforming to new media rather than controlling it, although cultivated in computing
                in the 1980s and 90s, has been an element of how mankind experiences media for as
                long as media have existed. Systems of writing, paper, and writing utensils
                standardize written language. Humans, as consumers over time, become increasingly
                passive in mediatic participation, especially as systems become more complex. In
                Jonathan Crary’s essay "Techniques of the Observer," he
                discusses Sir David Brewster’s kaleidoscope, which was invented in 1815. According
                to Crary, Brewster views "productivity and efficiency" as
                essential to this visual machine (Brewster, cited in [<a class="ref" href="#crary1988">Crary 1988</a>]).
                More importantly, he considers it a "mechanical means for the
                    reformation of art according to an industrial paradigm" (Brewster, cited
                in [<a class="ref" href="#crary1988">Crary 1988</a>, 22]). The resultant art form, a reflection and
                collection of still images, orders seemingly common objects into a beautiful
                narrative. As the observer interacts with the machine, minimal work creates
                endlessly original forms to admire. This action and its product is, of course,
                limited. For the machine to function properly, the user maintains distance from the
                inner workings and plays the role expected by the designer. Evolving visual and
                industrial technologies require users to play a specific part in the functioning of
                the machine. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">No longer the maker, the user becomes an element of the apparatus, a cog in the
                machine. Crary justifies this move by applying Marxist theory to elucidate
                human-machine relationships, "In the factory, Marx contend[s], the machine makes use of
                        man by subjecting him to a relation of contiguity, of part to other parts,
                        and of exchangeability… the apparently passive observers of the stereoscope
                        and Phenakistiscope were in fact made into producers, by virtue of specific
                        physical capacities, of forms of verisimilitude"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#crary1988">Crary 1988</a>, 33]. By becoming necessary not to the functioning, but to the purpose of the
                machine, the user becomes part of the machine itself. In order to create the artwork
                these machines were designed to produce, the user must actively contribute. That is,
                the observer must work to observe. The consumer continually embraces illusions,
                which deceive him into thinking he maintains control: "An apparatus openly based on a principle of disparity […]
                        inevitably would give way to a form that preserved the referential illusion
                        more fully than anything before it"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#crary1988">Crary 1988</a>, 35]. The user depends on the illusion of natural, human privilege to structure
                his consumer existence. For our current society, the ways in which consumers want
                and expect the quick, accessible, and "user-friendly" still denote these
                individuals as components of the machine. They become increasingly dependent on
                technologies as self-explanatory extensions of themselves. Users engage with digital
                technology in much the same way that the observer engages with the phenakistiscope.
                In both cases, the user works as an element of the machine in order to produce
                beautiful objects that are limited by the medium of their creation. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">No one exemplifies how to defy the limits a medium, using its constraints as a source
                of inspiration, better than the makers of concrete poetry. Concrete poetry became
                internationally significant beginning in the 1950s. In her seminal work entitled
                    <cite class="title italic">Concrete Poetry: A World View</cite>, published in 1968,
                Mary Ellen Solt traces the emergence of concrete poetry on the international stage.
                The movement originated simultaneously in Switzerland, with poet Eugen Gomringer,
                and in Brazil, with the Noigandres group. In her introduction, Solt offers a broad
                definition of concrete poetry: <blockquote><p>
                    Generally speaking the material of the concrete poem is
                        language: words reduced to their elements of letters (to see) syllables (to
                        hear). Some concrete poets stay with whole words. Others find fragments of
                        letters or individual speech sounds more suited to their needs. The
                        essential is reduced language... the concrete poet is concerned with
                        establishing his linguistic materials in a new relationship to space (the
                        page or its equivalent) and/or to time (abandoning the old linear measure).
                        Put another way this means the concrete poet is concerned with making an
                        object to be perceived rather than read. The visual poem is intended to be
                        seen like a painting; the sound poem is composed to be listened to like
                        music. Concrete poets, then, are united in their efforts to make objects or
                        compositions of sounds from particular materials.
                     [<a class="ref" href="#solt1968">Solt 1968</a>]
                </p></blockquote> Concrete poetry breaks with traditional forms set out by canonical poetry and
                constructs previously uncharted structures on the page. Juri Valoch, a
                Czechoslovakian poet, states that concrete poetry permits "as
                    much freedom as possible" and that the concrete poet’s goal is "to move as far as possible from traditional poetry" and
                write his "own things, unhampered, yet with a sense of
                    form" (Valoch, cited in [<a class="ref" href="#solt1968">Solt 1968</a>]). This focus on
                structure occupies the focus of the artist, but form must be of the artist’s own
                creation, uninhibited by the formalities and expectations of the existing canon of
                literature. The concrete poets revise what it means to compose. They rethink and
                revise the literary, historical, and media expectations in order to create a space
                for their own creative imaginations to flourish. In <cite class="title italic">Culture is
                    Our Business</cite>, McLuhan describes creative composers as the ultimate
                visionaries. He writes that "Poets and artists live on frontiers. They have no feedback,
                        only feedforward. They have no identities. They are probes"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#mcluhan1970">McLuhan 1970</a>, 44]. These individuals, like their work, accept no boundaries. Concrete poets
                compose with multimedia, often appealing in diverse ways (through writing, sound,
                and sight), in what the Noigandres refer to as "verbivocovisual." These "experimental" poems
                serve "as an act of protest against... traditionalism"
                (Ernst Jandl, cited in [<a class="ref" href="#solt1968">Solt 1968</a>]). The authors of these often
                intense compositions use concrete methodology to reject prescribed methods of
                creative thinking. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22"> The typewriter fulfilled a central role to authors' rising interest in composing
                concrete poetry. Charles Olsen describes the appeal of the technology, "It is the advantage of the typewriter that, due to its rigidity
                    and its space precisions, it can, for a poet, indicate exactly the breath, the
                    pauses, the suspensions even of syllables, the juxtapositions even of parts of
                    phrases, which he intends" (Olsen, cited in [<a class="ref" href="#solt1968">Solt 1968</a>]).
                Emerson writes that the pervasiveness of the typewriter made it "invisible to its users. The point at which a technology
                        saturates a culture is the point at which writers and artists, whose craft
                        is utterly informed by a sensitivity to their tools, begin to break apart
                        that same technology to once again draw attention to the way in which it
                        offers certain limits and possibilities to thought and expression"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#emerson2014b">Emerson 2014b</a>]. Poet Ronal Johnson supports Emerson's theory, when he admits, "As I am unable to think except on the typewriter, my poems have
                    been, from the beginning, all 8 1/2" X 11" (Johnson, cited in [<a class="ref" href="#solt1968">Solt 1968</a>]). The ever-present typewriter so completely permeates this
                time period that concrete poets, resisting the formalism inherent in the tradition
                of the poem, come to reject the normalized use of the typewriter, too. Instead of
                obeying the restrictions of the grid, they disrupt the expected pattern to draw
                attention to their intentional misuse of the apparatus.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23"> In spite of this radical refusal of traditional verse, concrete poetry attracted
                attention as being overtly academic and excessively "clean." bp Nichol coined
                the phrase "dirty concrete" to describe a less
                prescribed, more authentic style of composition. These poets achieved "dirty" by "court[ing] a visual and
                    linguistic non-linearity and illegibility by putting the typewriter to the test.
                    As these poets created smeared letters with inked ribbons or different carbons
                    while turning and twisting the page, the result was often the imprint of letters
                    that appeared literally dirty or rough around their edges"
                [<a class="ref" href="#emerson2014b">Emerson 2014b</a>]. Authors like bp Nichol implemented these
                compositional tactics to avoid falling into the "trap" of
                    "clean" concrete. He stresses that the author must
                remain "open and flexible... willing to keep seeking new exits
                    and entrances with regard to the poem" (Nichol, cited in [<a class="ref" href="#emerson2014b">Emerson 2014b</a>]. By resisting the strict concrete poetry or even Solt's
                suggestion that a generalized definition exists, dirty concrete remains aggressively
                counter to its ostensibly mainstream counterpart.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24"> The ever-present PC, in many ways, parallels the presence of the typewriter in the
                1950s, 60s and 70s, which led artists to experiment with the grid-like form of
                mechanical type to create concrete poetry. Perhaps the most obvious reincarnation of
                these dirty typewriter artists and their goals is through glitch art. Glitch art or
                glitch aesthetics has its roots in the most basic malfunctioning of electronic
                equipment (glitch). Its aesthetics reside in those moments when the digital, visual,
                or auditory performs in unexpected ways: the "wrong" colors, extreme
                pixilation, a skipping recording, an alien-like photo, an upside-down video, a link
                that leads nowhere, etc. Glitch aesthetics, then, as Emerson explains it in <cite class="title italic">The John Hopkins Guide to Digital Media</cite>, "involves experimentation with the visible results of
                        provoked or unprovoked computer error"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#emerson2014a">Emerson 2014a</a>, 235]. The artists who "glitch" rely on the unanticipated, and often
                anxiety-producing, behaviors of technology as the foundation of their art form. That
                is, theirs are compositions focus on what usually creates unease in the user,
                something other than the standard, anticipated construct of the GUI. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25"> Disobeying through art, especially digital art, is nothing new. Art collective JODI,
                comprised of Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans, chose the Internet as its medium in
                the mid-1990s and, since then, have built one of the most expansive collections of
                digital art, radicalizing what is expected, respected, and produced. JODI revels in
                the inconstancy of technology and machines. Its creators juxtapose any number of
                tools (glitch art, unseen hyperlinks, familiar formatting, uncomfortably distorted
                interfaces, etc.) with the user's expectations for what the interface should do.
                They masterfully and unpredictably upset those expectations. On March 17, 1999,
                Christiane Paul wrote, "There are interfaces so commonplace that we hardly notice
                        them anymore. The computer presents itself as a desktop, with a little trash
                        can bottom right, pull-down menus, scroll bars, system icons. With its
                        'interface in your face' approach, the website of jodi.org might be an
                        antidote to our obliviousness to interface standardization"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jodi1999">JODI 1999</a>]. Users have been so successfully trained to interact with their machines that
                responding to the interface requires hardly any concentration. It is second-nature.
                As true as Paul’s observation of the commonplace, invisible interface was in 1999,
                how much more so might it be today? In this age of smart phones, tablets, laptops,
                and (increasingly) wearables, the pervasiveness and touted user-friendly,
                self-explanatory nature of these multi-media devices has become the norm for any who
                can afford it and many who cannot. Perhaps Paul is correct, maybe our society needs
                JODI to draw attention to the processes in which the user partakes. When a user
                clicks "I Agree" under a "User Agreement," the system is not supposed to
                shut down (as it inevitably will at <a class="ref" href="http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org" onclick="window.open('http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org'); return false">wwwwwwwww.jodi.org</a>). When the user mouses over nothing, that mouse should
                not encounter a hyperlink. That very hyperlink should, the user is taught, direct
                the computer’s flow to a new, recognizable interface.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26"> JODI does not subscribe to these "shoulds," rather they revel in glitch to
                disrupt the user’s passive compliance to their machines. In <cite class="title italic">Technology and Industry News – Chicago</cite>, tech-artist Nick Briz explains
                that "Where technology attempts to be transparent and
                        nonintrusive, JODI makes it obvious, abrupt, unsettling, confusing"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#briz2011">Briz 2011</a>]. As JODI provides opportunities for an individual to toy with their
                creations, they interrupt the user’s expectations of the interface. The user must
                confront the idea that the apparent transparency of the taken-for-granted GUI is
                actually a disguise for many complicated processes, which lie beneath the surface of
                the interface and which overtly shape what the user creates. When a user encounters
                JODI’s work, that individual is made "forcefully aware of the role technology is playing in
                        [his/her] relationship to the world (or at the very least aware that it is
                        playing a role)"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#briz2011">Briz 2011</a>]. Through their disruption of the norm, JODI highlights how distant the user
                is from what happens behind the interface.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">To distract the user from his or her ignorance of a device’s inner workings,
                manufacturers place humanity at the center of a device’s advertising. My "iPhone" composition shows how the element of community
                became central to "iPhone mania." Unlike my previous compositions, I drew the
                text for this poem from Rob Kelley’s article, titled "iPhone
                    mania hits flagship stores"
                [<a class="ref" href="#kelley2007">Kelley 2007</a>]. This piece hearkens back to the human qualities Apple
                began to emphasize with Lisa. Instead of recognizing this device as an extension of
                an individual’s cognitive and creative abilities, the iPhone morphed into a promise
                of "connectedness" and community. Although smart phones supply knowledge at the
                swipe of a finger, they (more importantly) reconnect the isolated with the
                community. Kelley points out that when this new technology (the iPhone) came out,
                individuals lined the streets for days in advance. However, the technical prowess of
                the machine was rarely the focus: <blockquote><p>
                    At the Apple Store on Manhattan's tony Fifth Avenue, the man
                        who was fifth in line was planning to propose to his girlfriend with a ring
                        and an iPhone. For lunch Friday, a 44 year-old graphic designer who was
                        No.88 in line, ordered foie gras and sparkling lemonade delivered.
                            "Half the fun is the experience of the line," said Herman,
                        adding that there was talk among the iPhone hopeful of having a
                        post-purchase celebration.
                     [<a class="ref" href="#kelley2007">Kelley 2007</a>]
                </p></blockquote> This article points to engagements, shared meals, and celebrations, as the
                appeal of purchasing an iPhone. Although ease of use and technological capabilities
                certainly play a role in convincing consumers to purchase a device, it seems
                undeniable that the calculated inclusion of human capabilities, including social
                connectivity and individual creativity, remains central to the lure of these
                products.</div>

                     [<a class="ref" href="#criticalart1997">Critical Art Ensemble 1997</a>, 25]. In a battle there is the effort of fighting. So, my goal is individual
                effective resistance: resisting machines’ default settings, denying information
                access, unearthing what goes on behind even the most basic programs, and thinking
                creatively outside the "page." I hope to inspire the idea that, although
                functionality and user-friendliness are comfortable and convenient, they should not
                only be available at the cost of lock-boxed, streamlined, productive output.</div>

                    the mouse, created the keyset in the 1960s. This device, although initially
                    difficult to use, allowed individuals to manage both the functions of the
                    keyboard and the mouse, without needing to physically move their hands from one
                    to the other. Engelbart’s focus was to amplify the user’s control of the
                    computer’s capabilities. He envisioned the keyset as essential to unlocking the
                    potential of the computer. However, when Steve Jobs encountered both the keyset
                    and the mouse in 1979, he selected the mouse for use at Apple. He preferred the
                    mouse, because it required far less instruction, and therefore time, to learn to
                    use. The mouse was ultimately the "user-friendly" option [<a class="ref" href="#mars2015">Mars 2015</a>].</div></div><div id="worksCited"><h2>Works Cited</h2><div class="bibl"><span class="ref" id="d8747e1131"><!-- close --></span></div><div class="bibl"><span class="ref" id="apple1980"><!-- close -->Apple 1980</span> Apple Computer 1980, <cite class="title italic">Apple IIe Owner’s Manual</cite>.
