                    and frequently read print genres during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
                    By focusing on readers’ annotations in almanacs about everything from social

                    Creating a searchable, digital corpus of high-resolution images from annotated

                    methodological, and theoretical challenges often bleed into one another.
                    However, here we’d like to step back from some of the concrete technical aspects
                    of <cite class="title italic">The Almanac Archive</cite>’s design and implementation
                    to address the theoretical and methodological questions that a project like ours

                    outline the theoretical work going into its creation. Therefore, this article
                    also engages Kenneth Price’s assertion that we "need descriptions of digital thematic research
                            collections that highlight the editorial work and other types of
                            scholarly value that are added to the raw materials populating the

                    our approach to the issue of theorizing and encoding manuscript annotations in
                    printed books is especially relevant at a time when digital scholars’ interest
                    in marginalia has been increasing. In articulating the goals and challenges of
                        <cite class="title italic">The Almanac Archive</cite> we also make a case for
                    both questioning what defines a duplicate copy in a digital project and, by
                    extension, seeking out and reproducing these so-called duplicate copies.</div>

                    which shapes the form and goals of our resource’s creation as well as its unique
                    research potential. Understanding how readers used eighteenth- and
                    nineteenth-century almanacs makes clear how the genre offers scholarly research
                    possibilities that are not easily harnessed without digital tools. In the second
                    section of the article we consider the theoretical questions that our project
                    raises in dialogue with other theorists of digital and print media. In
                    particular, we explain <cite class="title italic">The Almanac Archive</cite>’s
                    intended organizational structure with reference to trends in digitization that
                    often highlight what Jerome McGann terms a text’s "linguistic codes" over its "bibliographic
                        codes"; our archive aims to make the material features of almanacs,
                    including their annotations, as accessible as the printed content of the texts
                    themselves [<a class="ref" href="#mcgann1991">McGann 1991</a>]. Finally, we end with a brief discussion
                    of the research potential of <cite class="title italic">The Almanac

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Unlike other print genres, almanacs and the marginalia that readers added to them
                    give us insight into both everyday life in the Romantic century and the
                    organization systems that people used to manage it. Offering information about
                    holidays, university term dates, hours of sunrise and sunset, predictions for
                    the future, and chronologies of historical events, almanacs were vital books for
                    a mass number of readers who recorded their observations and daily activities in
                    their pages. Importantly, almanacs didn’t simply provide a variety of
                    information; they provided diverse readers with the same standard information.
                    Variation certainly existed between different almanacs aimed as specific groups
                    of readers, such as farmers or lawyers; however, the genre as a whole was
                    largely unified (and, indeed unifying) in the basic, utilitarian information it
                    provided users about time, geography, tidal shifts, and history.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">While almanacs were crucial reference tools, they were also for many readers
                    repositories of daily observations and records of both public and private life.
                    Studies of life writing from the Early Modern period to the nineteenth century
                    have noted that writing in almanacs was one of the earliest and most common
                    forms of diary keeping. Famous diarists such as William Gladstone and George
                    Washington began their diaries in almanacs, and far more common, of course, were
                    anonymous readers who noted births and deaths, daily activities, and memoranda
                    in their margins (see Figure 1) [<a class="ref" href="#gladstone1968">Gladstone 1968</a>, 16]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#mccarthy2013">McCarthy 2013</a>, 11]. For example, Adam Smyth has identified
                    the practice of writing personal notes in almanacs as "the most common form of self-accounting in early modern
                            England"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#smyth2008">Smyth 2008</a>, 204].<a class="noteRef" href="#d6415e362">[4]</a> The almanacs’ prevalence and
                    their use as diaries increased in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as
                    growing numbers of people were able to purchase, read, and write in their
                    almanacs.</div>

                    related to the weather made in the month of January 1801. The search results may

                    Drucker’s work on theoretical approaches to interface design applies to our

                    for interface design that makes evident the role of performativity in systems of
                    organization. She explains: "Multiple imaging modes that create palimpsestic or
                            parallax views of objects make it more difficult to imagine reading as
                            an act of recovering truth, and render the interpretative act itself

                    different readers approached, organized, and interpreted both time and their

                    published calendars and readers’ annotations about their lives and schedules —
                    may reveal certain patterns of thinking about time, individual copies with
                    readers’ annotations speak to the relational and interpretative nature of
                    reading and annotation. The resource, then, offers the type of palimpsestic
                    representation that Drucker has so convincingly praised. Thus, <cite class="title italic">The Almanac Archive </cite>is not primarily about discovering
                    truths about almanacs or annotation practices in the Romantic century, but
                    instead it is about conveying the numerous ways that readers adapted and
                    subverted, employed and rejected the structures of truth and temporality that
                    individual almanacs seemed to promote. Moreover, in allowing digital users to

                    is especially relevant to duplicate copies, since the rise of the machine-press
                    period in the early nineteenth century made mass producing printed texts a real
                    possibility for the first time. Indeed, the Romantic century encompasses a vital
                    and volatile time in the material production of printed knowledge, yet the media
                    transition from the hand-press era to the machine-press era is one that is all
                    too often simplified and has led to unfounded, persistent assumptions about the
                    "sameness" of books from the machine-press period. Many scholars working across
                    disciplines and temporal periods acknowledge the crucial changes in material
                    knowledge production that marked the transition from the hand-press to the
                    machine-press period at the end of the eighteenth century. Laid paper shifted to
                    wove paper and, soon thereafter, to machine-made paper. The wooden press that
                    had remained substantially the same since Gutenberg gave way to the iron-hand
                    press in the early nineteenth century followed by an assortment of other
                    (steam-powered) presses that produced printed materials in unprecedented
                    quantities. Yet it wasn’t just the scale of print that grew; the uniformity of
                    the printed materials themselves also increased. The prominence of edition
                    binding, for instance, expanded rapidly from the 1820s onward, so that the
                    standardization of the covers of printed books aligned with the perceived
                    uniformity of their printed content.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6415e587">[10]</a> Such a narrative, of course, obscures the granularity of
                    technological changes while representing the production of material artifacts as
                    a flat teleology of technological advancement occurring at the expense of text’s
                    physical uniqueness or "aura," to borrow Walter

                    gradual and the ability and desire to create uniform, duplicate copies has been
                    overestimated. As bibliographers have long realized, the variety and uniqueness
                    associated with early modern books is also "true of books printed after the hand-press

                         [<a class="ref" href="#stauffer">Stauffer forthcoming</a>]. One way to quantify this variation is to examine not only
                        "duplicate" copies of individual texts or editions (which Stauffer has
                    done with ten copies of the 1902 edition of the poet James Whitcomb Riley’s
                        <cite class="title italic">An Old Sweetheart of Mine</cite>, each containing
                    significant bibliographical variants [<a class="ref" href="#stauffer">Stauffer forthcoming</a>]) but also to
                    trace a largely-standard genre such as the almanac through this period of media
                    transition. Comparing duplicate almanacs as well as examining runs of particular
                    almanac titles across decades challenges the
                    notion of sameness and duplication in historical forms of printing and reading
                    practices.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Yet, even while we advocate for digitizing and preserving duplicates, we still do
                    struggle with the logistics of digitally representing them. The question we
                    return to again and again is how much physical variation or annotation makes a
                    copy unique for the purposes of our project? A single word written in the
                    margins? A doodle? A mark? And how do we describe indecipherable or amorphous
                    marks in our database? In posing these questions, we recognize the necessity of
                    balancing our resource’s comprehensiveness with its usability. We are reluctant
                    to flood users with redundant search results containing duplicates with only the
                    most minor or indecipherable annotations, but we also want to create a resource
                    that users with research questions very different from our own can employ to
                    their advantage. The challenge, which continually returns us to the most
                    interesting and fundamental of digital humanities questions, is how to create a
                    database structure that categorizes and tags information in a way that permits
                    users to navigate and search effectively, while also minimizing interpretive
                    decisions on the backend that foreclose client-side interpretative
                    possibilities. For example, we initially considered dismissing some of the less
                    intelligible marks we encountered in almanacs — short horizontal lines penciled
                    next to given dates. However, even these small marks hold important research
                    potential. Maureen Perkins’s study of nineteenth-century almanacs notes that
                    women may have used almanacs discretely to keep track of their menstrual cycles,
                    for example, and such marks may constitute interesting and valuable data for
                    researchers interested in women’s studies or the history of sexuality [<a class="ref" href="#perkins1996">Perkins 1996</a>, 44]. The variety of uses that readers brought
                    to their almanacs — and which we are trying to illuminate through our own
                    resource — reminds us that digital resources risk precluding user
                    interpretations through the decisions their designers make while structuring

                    limitations. Focusing on the unit of the page in <cite class="title italic">The

                    uses in significant ways [<a class="ref" href="#mak2011">Mak 2011</a>]. Prioritizing the page and

                    attempts to limit the appropriative, flattening elements that Hillel Schwartz
                    associates with copying technologies that take "without
                        homage" and obscure "the historical steps that
                        gave rise" to the original and, in turn, its original uses [<a class="ref" href="#schwartz2014">Schwartz 2014</a>, 191]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">Theorizing <cite class="title italic">The Almanac Archive</cite> has therefore led us
                    to think critically about prominent ways of categorizing digital objects. In
                        "Digitizing Latin Incunabula: Challenges, Methods, and
                        Possibilities," Jeffrey A. Rydberg-Cox describes five different
                    categories of digitization: Image Books, Image Books with Minimal Structural
                    Data, Image Front Transcriptions, Carefully Edited and Tagged Transcriptions,
                    and Scholarly and Critical Editions [<a class="ref" href="#rydbergcox2009">Rydberg-Cox 2009</a>, 8].
                        <cite class="title italic">The Almanac Archive</cite> fits into the category of
                    Image Books with Structural Data, yet we resist the connotations of
                    Rydberg-Cox’s term "minimal," for the metadata
                    attached to each image and almanac will allow refined searching by individual
                    categories, such as publisher, place of publication, library collection, type of
                    almanac (i.e. astrological or agricultural), and type of annotation (i.e.
                    textual or pictorial). Thus, we challenge the idea that there is a hierarchy of
                    digitization involving various degrees of access to textual content. Instead we
                    conceive ways of digitizing that prioritize the bibliographic unit of the page.
                    Because the project recognizes and highlights that almanacs were physical
                    interfaces that users interacted with, we want to avoid creating a digital
                    interface that privileges either printed text or manuscript annotations, but
                    instead always displays the two side by side, in relation to each other. John
                    Bradley’s work on digital annotation has emphasized how annotated texts involve "two rather different applications [that] must
                            co-exist"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2012">Bradley 2012</a>, 12]. While we agree that the different agents, intentions, and technologies
                    of the publishers and the annotators must be recognized, our archive seeks to
                    emphasize the codependence of these two applications. In this respect, our
                    approach prefers thinking of these applications as "overlapping hierarchies," as Joanna Drucker does, thereby
                    recognizing the competing ways of valuing different linguistic and bibliographic
                    components of a digitized object [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2007">Drucker 2007</a>, 182]. </div>

                <h1 class="head">The Research Potential of <cite class="title italic">The Almanac
                    Archive</cite></h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">The unique research potential of our archive is a function of the fascinating
                    corpus and little-studied genre we have chosen and of our commitment to making
                    both bibliographic and linguistic features of the almanacs accessible to users.
                    By valuing equally annotations, printed text, as well as key metadata that will
                    be included in the archive, we resist privileging one type of information over
                    another. For our own research we will use the resource to track how eighteenth-
                    and nineteenth-century readers related to time and historical events, and we
                    will therefore focus primarily on the annotations found in the almanacs to
                    compare reader responses to time. Yet annotations also offer other avenues for
                    scholarly research. For readers unable to afford both an almanac and a dedicated
                    pocket-book diary, these volumes functioned as diaries. Because they were so
                    inexpensive, often costing between just one and three shillings, almanacs were
                    affordable to people who were unable to purchase other printed matter. Given the
                    characteristics and uses of the almanac in this period, the potential
                    applications for this project are diverse. Historians of weather, for instance,
                    might track weather patterns or climate change since users frequently noted
                    weather anomalies. Thus, material from <cite class="title italic">The Almanac Archive
                    </cite>might support other digital resources such as <a class="ref" href="http://www.oldweather.org" onclick="window.open('http://www.oldweather.org'); return false"><cite class="title italic">Old
                        Weather</cite></a>, which invites users to transcribe weather-related
                    entries found in ships’ logs. Some almanacs include annotations about payments
                    to employees and other financial records, indicating that they may be untapped
                    resources for information about labour and economic history. Readers’ notes in
                    farming almanacs provide insight into historical agricultural practices. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">While in some instances information about an almanac’s annotator remains unknown,
                    in others inscriptions of ownership or records of provenance provide key
                    information about annotators such as gender, occupation, geographical location,
                    and socioeconomic status. Aggregating these entries and this information will,
                    as the corpus expands, offer a new tool for historians, particularly those
                    interested in questions of everyday life and gender in Britain. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">As compelling as the almanacs’ annotations and annotators are, we are designing
                        <cite class="title italic">The Almanac Archive</cite> to foster other potential
                    areas of research. For example, the database will contain a metadata field for
                    the prices of almanacs. This information about price combined with information
                    about readers’ marginalia could help researchers make more concrete arguments
                    about annotation practices related to cost of books. The metadata will also
                    include information about provenance and how copies of almanacs are organized in
                    library collections. We have, for instance, noted that some users bound a series
                    of almanacs together. As our corpus of almanacs grows, it will be possible to
                    draw conclusions about not only the culture of annotating individual volumes but
                    also larger cultural value systems that impacted how groups of almanacs were
                    preserved and organized. As Thomas R. Adams and Nicolas Barker have suggested,
                    the survival and durability of different kinds of texts is an important variable
                    in any model of book history [<a class="ref" href="#adams2001">Adams and Barker 2001</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">Of course, just as eighteenth- and nineteenth-century readers used the interfaces
                    of their almanacs in surprising ways, we anticipate that once the resource
                    becomes live scholars and teachers will use it in similarly original ways. The
                    flexibility and the variety of our archive’s applications, then, seem to embrace
                    in a digital, scholarly form the original aspects of the historical artifacts
                    that will comprise the archive itself. Ultimately, our archive’s unique research
                    potential lies in the light it sheds on the diverse and unexpected ways users
                    respond to structured data, whether in eighteenth-century printed texts or in
                    contemporary digital resources.</div>

                        the category proposed by William Galperin and Susan Wolfson to describe the
                            "intellectually and historically coherent"
                        period between 1750 and 1850 [<a class="ref" href="#galperin1997">Galperin and Wolfson 1997</a>]. This period
                        involved significant changes both in the production and consumption of
                        almanacs, including the end of the Stationers’ Company long-held monopoly on
                        the production of almanacs in 1775, the abolition of the stamp duty on
                        printed almanacs in 1834, and a general increase in the size of the British
                        reading public. On the legal decisions influencing the end of the monopoly

                        manual transcriptions of historical readers’ annotations rather than OCR is
                        theoretically-driven, yet it is also informed by practical, technological
                        limitations. Almanacs’ printed content is largely in tabular form with
                        numerous columns; there is little text that’s readable (to humans or
                        computers) in a traditional, literary sense. Almanacs contain significant
                        quantities of numbers, symbols, and abbreviations that are inconsistent
                        across different almanacs. The almanacs’ original form, then, makes them
                        difficult to OCR. Other resources that provide access to digitized almanacs
                        such as HathiTrust and Internet Archive do OCR the texts. The resulting
                        transcriptions, however, are of limited usefulness since they are plagued by
