                <p>This is a review of <cite class="title italic">Rhetoric and the Digital Humanities</cite>
                    (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2015), a collection
                    of essays by contemporary rhetoricians edited by Jim Ridolfo
                    and William Hart-Davidson. These essays are often notable in
                    their thoroughgoing efforts to theorize the work of digital
                    humanities in scholarship and teaching. In addition to
                    serving as an introduction to the digital humanities for
                    rhetoricians, this book is of value to digital humanists
                    residing in informatics programs, as well as those in
                    English studies generally</p>
            </div>
            
        
        
           <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Rhetoricians can boast working in a more or less unbroken
                conversation stretching back to before Corax and Tisias, two
                millennia before modern English was spoken. Of course, humans
                have been speaking, reasoning, and arguing long before that, and
                all over the planet. The rhetorical tradition starting in the
                Mediterranean is generally considered unique because it both
                produced and theorized rhetoric at the same time. And in the
                present, the teaching and study of rhetoric is consistently
                theoretically self-aware. Surveying the methodologies of
                presenters at the 2015 Indiana Digital Rhetoric Symposium and
                also reflecting on the state of the field, Crystal VanKooten
                assigns theory more than half of a pie chart and concludes
                "Most
                of us are theorizing digital rhetoric"  [<a class="ref" href="#vankooten2015">VanKooten 2015</a>].</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">That is one reason for reading this book. It has been argued (by,
                for example, Drucker and Liu in the landmark collection <cite class="title italic">Debates in the Digital Humanities</cite>) that
                digital humanities is strong on method and short on
                self-examination, criticism, and theorizing. Although most of
                the 23 chapters in this collection are applied studies of one
                form or another, they are all theoretically informed. As their
                authors – who are mostly faculty in rhetoric programs – join
                this conversation on the digital humanities, they bring a
                thoroughgoing theoretical examination.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Drucker and Liu’s stance toward DH is reinforced when
                contributors McNely and Teston assert: "Rhetorically-informed
                digital humanists should proceed with caution — doing DH is not as
                simple as choosing a digital tool and then combining that tool
                and tactic with a given methodological approach; indeed, a given
                tactic may be at odds with one's strategy"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 112]. Their observation might seem
                self-evident, an enthymeme grounded in how critics have been
                trained for decades: we always have a theory and some narrative
                of literary history in mind when we read. This may not be so
                self-evident in a time when it is not surprising to see a
                digital humanist pick up the latest technology and run with it
                just to see what happens. We might throw fifty novels at an
                algorithm to see what sticks, and think about interpretation and
                narrative after we have some results — and many might argue that
                this is an entirely valid methodology. But there is more at
                stake here. This book is published and I write this review in a
                moment when some argue that theory is no longer necessary — see
                for example Chris Anderson's essay "The End of Theory" and the
                cluster of essays it introduces in <cite class="title italic">Wired
                    Magazine</cite> [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2008">Anderson 2008</a>], and the collection of essays
                published by Microsoft, <cite class="title italic">The Fourth Paradigm
                </cite> [<a class="ref" href="#hey2009">Hey et al. 2009</a>]: machines process mountains of data and
                find patterns and correlations with more predictive power than
                our theories can. Beyond truisms, what we need is an examination
                of how the use of theory has and is changing. Digital tools are
                (or should be – provided one's tools are not a black box)
                manifestations of theory, such as Bayes' theorem or other
                statistical models, along with some basic structuralist
                assumptions.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Below I account for some of the contributions to this thoughtful
                collection.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The positionality of the digital humanities, and how it might
                disrupt established disciplinary lines, is much discussed at the
                moment (for that matter, so is the institutional status of
                English studies generally). Chapters take on these disciplinary
                issues, and these are all distinguished by self-awareness. Reid
                argues that just as digital humanities disrupts the humanities,
                digital rhetorics are post-human, post-structuralist disruptions
                of humanist traditions in rhetoric. Carter, Jones, and Hamcumpai
                argue for viewing disciplinary lines like rhetoric and DH not as
                territory to be seized and defended but rather as
                <em class="emph">kairos</em> (situations, occasions of
                opportunity and need for rhetoric). Walls builds a theory of
                interdisciplinarity (a "rhetoric of alliance"), based on
                histories of native peoples in North America.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Two theoretically-aware case studies of editing projects
                demonstrate how we might proceed on practical projects while
                trying to maintain theoretical awareness. Eyman and Ball narrate
                their efforts to put in place a new online publishing system for
                the online journal <cite class="title italic">Kairos: A Journal of
                    Rhetoric, Technology and Pedagogy</cite>. This effort at
                digital production included rhetorical self-analysis at every
                step. Along similar lines, Boyle asks what makes an online
                archive of Quintilian's works genuinely rhetorical.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Other contributors explore new methods to conduct research in
                writing and communication. Johnson suggests ways we might model
                scholarly influence, beginning with citation data. These include
                factor analysis, grouping by institutions, and geographic
                mapping. How he would get all the information he plans to model
                is not always clear, but his arguments could point to future
                studies. The primary counter-argument Johnson sets himself
                against is that many humanists are skeptical of numbers and
                suspicious of reducing their own influence to numbers
                (particularly as these numbers could be used for tenure) and he
                says, "Scholars who are hesitant to adopt numerical values as a
                way to bargain for tenure and promotions are giving up one of
                the more powerful argumentative rhetorics of the twenty-first
                century — the use of mathematics"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 100]. While the data
                available are far from complete,<a class="noteRef" href="#d7425e252">[1]</a> this does not mean that
                studies that map what we can see, like what Johnson suggests,
                cannot lead to important results. If, say, we can see a third or
                half of all citations or some other fraction, then
                generalizations we make about influence could still be worth
                investigating in the ways that Johnson suggests, even if the
                rate of recall would be unacceptable for matters of tenure and
                promotion.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Kennedy and Long use online interaction to view the writing
                process. They argue that sources such as the version histories
                of wiki pages (where every single edit is recorded), can be an
                excellent place to study authorship: "these writerly moves and
                practices reveal the authorial life of the writer . . . as well
                as the life of the document"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 148]. They provide a short primer on qualitative approaches to
                online behavior, and discuss how the data can be collected,
                managed, and coded — as well as ethical considerations. This
                chapter would serve as an excellent starting point for research
                projects investigating digital authorship and online behavior
                more generally, as would McNely and Teston's chapter.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Hart describes his effort running a commercial program, DICTION,
                to perform sentiment analysis of the words in a corpus of texts
                with predefined genres. The corpus is described only as "sixteen
                thousand contemporary texts spanning the rhetorical universe"
                [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 161] and I wish we were told
                what the texts were and how they were assigned to genres. He
                observes that "DICTION cannot distinguish between a sentence
                like 'the dog bit the man' and 'the man bit the
                    dog'"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 158].</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">To Hart’s credit, this is the only reference in the collection to
                the concept of the "bag of words," so it
                was disappointing how quickly he moved past this important
                point. In topic modeling, a very popular method of text mining
                at the moment, a <em class="emph">topic</em> is defined as a
                distribution of words over a fixed vocabulary [<a class="ref" href="#blei2012">Blei 2012</a>] and
                should not be conflated with a rhetorical <em class="emph">topos</em>.
                Hart says that the software supposes "that
                audiences depend on human understandings of proportionality when
                responding to a text" [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 158],
                that is, simply: the more optimistic words are contained in a
                text, the more optimistic a text is. This methodology holds up
                and shakes documents so that the words fall into a bag, defining
                as a text a set of probabilities of words. This general method,
                combined with the scale of corpora, would seem to flatten
                rhetorical situations and empty individual texts of their
                intentional (if we might otherwise be inclined to look for
                intention) and suasive content. I hope to hear more speculation
                by rhetoricians of what happens to rhetorical texts when they
                are viewed at the scale at which Franco Morretti and many other
                digital humanists prefer to operate. We can argue
                    about whether Hart has adequately theorized his digital
                    tools here, but this piece deserves credit for spurring
                    exactly that argument.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Three thoughtful chapters on archives and digitization should be
                read by the broad community of researchers concerned with
                digital archives and libraries. Hoffman and Waisanen's chapter
                provides a survey of algorithmic tools for analyzing texts and
                corpora. Like Hart, they theorize these methods rhetorically.
                They bring in the theory of the "ideograph" as formulated by
                Michael McGee, referring to specific words that carry
                ideological weight in a given historic moment [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 180]. The idea here is similar to Raymond
                Williams' "keywords," and several other formulations linking
                words with ideologies. When in DH we count words and find
                patterns, we hope that the words will serve as surrogates for
                something significant. But so far this is a blunt instrument and
                we cannot generalize from one case to another very well. This
                activity would benefit from more general theorizing, and
                contributors to this book offer some points of entry.</div>

                be done more often. They survey theoretical issues –
                "invigorating epistemological
                    dilemmas"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 235] – raised by digital archives: location,
                access, authorization, digitizations, publics, and metadata
                (along with Eyman and Ball’s, this essay stands out for
                addressing issues of metadata). This is a starting point, and

                similar to many projects in community-based archiving and
                community informatics (and they would probably benefit from
                studying this body of research). The archives Rice and Rice
                advocate are bottom-up and not necessarily built to last:
                "while
                its longevity may be useful for a number of reasons, we would
                not consider this archive a failure if it is erased tomorrow.
                The pop-up archive's focus is not in preservation but in the
                gesture and performance of archiving moments" [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 251]. Like many contributions in this
                collection, I would love to take the essay into a seminar in
                informatics and ask graduate students to respond to this

                sound like a shot across the bow. What I mean is: everything
                that Barack Obama and John Boehner say is carefully preserved
                with the intention of keeping it findable, usable, and
                trustworthy for as long as there might be persons to read
                it — because it is considered important. Many in the cultural
                heritage community are doing the same thing with the texts,
                artifacts, and stories left behind by members of subaltern
                groups which otherwise might be forgotten. On the one hand,
                building archives not defined by persistence is wonderfully
                provocative: it can prompt questions about the nature of memory
                and cultural production and narrative. On the other hand, the
                longevity of archives from Queen Elizabeth II or Donald Trump is
                in little doubt. We preserve what we value.</div>

                archives: "these systems are clunky at best and irrelevant at
                worst"; they "prioritize data over
                    experience"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 255].
                She states "What these archives in
                practice and the digital humanities in general desperately need
                is a sense of audience, appeal, and interaction"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 255]. In fact, were Potts to walk into an
                iSchool she would find research and practitioners in whole
                subfields like knowledge organization, computer-supported
                cooperative work, community informatics, and even wonks in
                information retrieval who are constantly asking the same
                user-centered questions. My point here is not simply to refute a
                deficit Potts would fill, but rather to say that there are more
                people speaking her language than she seems to expect.</div>

                students in the humanities should learn to code, and also Ian
                Bogost's formulation of "procedural literacy." Two of the most
                interesting pieces, by Stolley and Ballentine, could be read as
                responding directly to Potts, arguing "Many of the discussions
                of making fetishize the concept of coding"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 257] — and this is another claim I would
                take into an information science seminar. This pair of essays by
                technical communication specialists makes fascinating arguments
                in favor of learning to program, and are among the most
                interesting in the volume (the editors did place them
                immediately following Potts' piece, and rhetoricians do love an

                with Hart's contribution, is probably the best read in the book.
                He argues that coding is an essentially writerly activity. In
                observing that Rails is installed and accessed entirely through
                the command line with no downloading, dragging, or
                double-clicking, he says, "Rails can be installed, invoked, and
                developed entirely though writing"  [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 265]. This is one of the most striking sentences, seeming
                self-evident once it is said yet thought-provoking, that I have

                own interpretive practices) because we do not have the language
                to argue in these spaces" [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 278–279]. He goes on to offer a case study of a technical
                writing project, providing documentation integrated into the
                display of X-ray, MRI, and CT scans. An intimate understanding
                of the code controlling how the documentation displays and
                interacts with the operation of the system is necessary for
                effective writing. Lack of such understanding would render the

                disciplinary homes. It is a good introduction for those coming
                from a rhetoric background, and is of interest not only to those
                in English studies generally, but also to digital humanists in
                informatics programs. Of course, it is somewhat artificial to
                segregate rhetoricians, who swim in the same water as their
                colleagues in English and Communications departments, from other
                scholars with research agendas in digital humanities. But we can
                go further. Reading the essays in this book, I often found
                myself thinking that if these researchers were to walk into the
                nearest iSchool, and compare notes with researchers in
                informatics, both would benefit from the resulting

                        timely and important enough to note the accuracy and
                        recall of citation counting. There are good reasons to
                        be skeptical of citation numbers when it comes to the
                        humanities and social sciences: our abilities to extract
                        citation from databases of journal articles in the
                        humanities and social sciences is not as reliable as it
                        is in the natural sciences; monographs are much more
                        important in the humanities and social sciences than
                        they are in the hard sciences, and citations in books
                        have not been reliably mined at the moment; and articles
                        in the sciences cite more sources. There is also
                        evidence that researchers are reading more even as they
                        cite less (see Renear and Palmer 2009; Larivière,

                        current ability to gather all citations in the sciences
                        is less thane ideal.</div></div><div id="worksCited"><h2>Works Cited</h2><div class="bibl"><span class="ref" id="anderson2008"><!-- close -->Anderson 2008</span> Anderson, Chris.
