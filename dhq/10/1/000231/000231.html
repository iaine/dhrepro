                <p>In this paper, I offer an overview of an idea for a metadata
                    archive, called the <cite class="title italic">Sentences
                        Commentary Text Archive</cite>, that attempts to
                    collect and make accessible metadata about the five
                    century-long medieval tradition of commenting on the <cite class="title italic">Sentences</cite> of Peter Lombard. If
                    scaled for production, this kind of archive would enhance
                    collaboration among editors, promote previously impossible
                    analyses of large sections of the Sentences commentary
                    tradition, and generally become the backbone of future
                    applications making use of this data.</p>

            <div class="div div0">
                <h1 class="head">I. What is a "Sentences" Commentary?</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Peter Lombard wrote the medieval book, known as the <cite class="title italic">Sentences</cite>, during the course of
                    his teaching career at Paris in the middle of the twelfth
                    century. In this work, Lombard intended to bring together
                    diverse theological opinions (<em class="emph">sententia</em>) and to
                    harmonize them into a single concordant system. The book
                    soon became the standard theological textbook in European
                    theology faculties. By the thirteenth century, writing a
                    commentary on the <cite class="title italic">Sentences</cite> of
                    Peter Lombard was a required exercise for anyone hoping to
                    become a Master in the faculty of theology.<a class="noteRef" href="#d34613e212">[1]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Given that Lombard's <cite class="title italic">Sentences</cite>
                    covers a broad spectrum of philosophical and theological
                    issues, it is an extremely valuable source for tracking the
                    development of ideas. Today, we know of approximately 1,000
                    extant commentaries. Unfortunately, only a small number of
                    these commentaries are available in printed editions, and an
                    even smaller number are available in critical editions. Most
                    remain available only in difficult to read Latin manuscripts
                    stored away in difficult to access libraries.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">While the current scholarly practice primarily aims to make
                    these texts available in printed editions, this workflow
                    suffers from a couple of problems. Today, a static print
                    edition of these commentaries remains the gold standard.
                    This is not always without good reason. The unchangeable
                    nature of the text helps create stable citation practices
                    that online resources often have a hard time replicating.
                    Likewise, the print edition is easier to document for
                    purposes of tenure and promotion. In the present proposal, I
                    am not interested in disputing these realities, but rather
                    in thinking about a workflow towards print that can enable
                    other possibilities at the same time. One such possibility
                    lies in making working drafts and on-going editions of texts
                    — editions that often take decades to complete —
                    sufficiently discoverable so as to promote collaboration. It
                    is, however, hard for potentially interested scholars to
                    collaborate if they are unaware of texts or editions in need
                    of collaborators. Another important possibility is the
                    future large-scale analysis of the tradition as a whole. The
                    divergence of editorial practices, file formats, and the
                    generally isolated practice of print production makes
                    large-scale analysis of the entire corpus difficult. Often
                    very little is known about the digital format of the
                    post-publication file. But these post-publication files, if
                    archived and catalogued in an accessible way, could become
                    the bases of a new understanding of this five-century long
                    tradition and its various developments across time and
                    region.</div>

                <h1 class="head">The Function of a Metadata Archive</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In this short paper, I offer an overview of a metadata
                    archive (still in development) that, if scaled for
                    production, could support the kind of collaboration
                    mentioned above, promote previously impossible analyses of
                    large sections of the <cite class="title italic">Sentences</cite>
                    commentary tradition, and generally become the backbone of
                    future applications making use of this data.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">By "archive" I mean a large collection of
                    resources produced by an identifiable tradition and
                    organized (with intentional metadata) according to the
                    organic relationships that constitute said tradition. While
                    Kate Theimer has noted the propensity of digital humanists
                    to play fast and loose with the meaning of an
                        "archive," she mentions one important
                    criterion of an archive that fits my present use of the
                    word. In attempting to describe the difference between an
                    archive and a collection she writes: <blockquote><p>
                        What defines the work of archivist,
                            and so "an archive" in the mind
                            of an archivist, is what materials are selected and
                            how they are managed. Archivists select and preserve
                                "archives" as defined in the
                            primary definition, <cite class="title italic">which is to
                                say aggregates of materials with an organic
                                relationship</cite>, rather than items that may
                            be similar in some manner, but otherwise unrelated
                            (emphasis mine).<a class="noteRef" href="#d34613e266">[2]</a>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The suggestion that an archive is a collection of materials
                    with an <em class="emph">organic relationship</em> is what I have in
                    mind here. This metadata archive attempts to aggregate a
                    collection of intimately related resources that build on and
                    reference each other over time. The goal of the metadata is
                    to organize these resources in such a way that organic
                    relationships can be tracked and made discoverable by future
                    users.</div>

                    archive and the basis on which a user or application can
                    search and sort resources. As such, it also true to say that
                    this conception of archive does depart from the perhaps more
                    traditional notion of an archive as a collection of material
                    objects and is instead primarily interested in a "purposeful collection of digital
                        surrogates"

                    (TEI), of a very late-fourteenth century <cite class="title italic">Sentences</cite> commentary written by a
                    Parisian thinker named Peter Plaoul. What I now call the

                    is, to allow users access to early transcriptions and to
                    allow them to comment and collaborate, should they become
                    interested in the text: an approach that has much in common
                    with what is elsewhere called "interactive dynamic

                    needed to be harvested and presented. Second, as I began to
                    detach the <cite class="title italic">LombardPress</cite>
                    framework from the text of the Plaoul edition in order to
                    support the presentation of other editions (see for example
                        <a class="ref" href="http://adamwodeham.org" onclick="window.open('http://adamwodeham.org'); return false">http://adamwodeham.org</a>), I noticed that there was
                    a lot of repeated and re-useable information. The prospect
                    of a central archive would not only allow different
                    applications to reuse redundant information, but would also
                    allows users and applications to recognize interesting
                    connections across the entire tradition: connections like
                    the reuse of a particular quotation by multiple authors or
                    spikes in the use of key words across time.</div>

                <h1 class="head">III. Technical Specifics: The Current <cite class="title italic">Sentences Commentary Text Archive</cite> Prototype and
                    Workflow</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">A primary goal of the <cite class="title italic">Sentences
                        Commentary Text Archive</cite> is to be a coordinating
                    service that both humans and machine applications can use.
                    While the archive could itself include the capacity to store
                    the actual source text of an edition, this is not its
                    central function. Rather, as individual sections of a text
                    begin to be edited, it is recommended that they be stored in
                    a development repository (e.g. <a class="ref" href="http://github.com" onclick="window.open('http://github.com'); return false">http://github.com</a> or
                        <a class="ref" href="http://bitbucket.org" onclick="window.open('http://bitbucket.org'); return false">http://bitbucket.org</a>). Subsequently,
                    strategically selected versions should be deposited into an
                    institutional repository. The proposed metadata archive
                    would then become a central clearinghouse of information
                    about these texts that can, first and foremost, point users,
                    developers, and publishers to the location of the encoded
                    text, as well as to any plaintext or HTML manifestations.
                    With these pointers in place, substantial amounts of
                    metadata can be added to facilitate the discovery of various
                    texts.</div>

                    technical details about the current prototype of the archive
                    that I have built. The point of such a report is not
                    necessarily to declare the best possible practice or even
                    describe what the final form of the <cite class="title italic">Sentences Commentary Text Archive</cite> should look
                    like. Rather, the primary point is to identify one possible
                    (and tested) route by which the idea might be implemented.
                    Second, it is to simply demonstrate that the technical
                    challenges are the smallest obstacles to implementation.
                    Technically speaking such an archive is not overwhelmingly
                    difficult to construct. The larger obstacle is finding
                    institutional support and generating the collective will of
                    the field to contribute its semantically encoded
                    transcriptions (both in draft and final form) for metadata
                    harvesting. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">In the current prototype (an early incarnation of which can
                    be found at <a class="ref" href="http://scta.info" onclick="window.open('http://scta.info'); return false">http://scta.info</a>), the archive metadata
                    extraction begins with an XML document, called a
                    "projectdata.xml" file that includes a list of
                    &lt;item&gt;s. Each &lt;item&gt; in this document represents
                    a discrete section within a given <cite class="title italic">Sentences</cite> commentary. Generally, it is assumed
                    that an &lt;item&gt; is a natural place for discrete file
                    divisions to be made and thus each &lt;item&gt; would
                    correspond to a TEI file replete with its own metadata-rich
                    &lt;teiHeader&gt;. This kind of list of &lt;item&gt;s is
                    usually called a "Question List" when
                    published in academic journals. See for example [<a class="ref" href="#friedmanschabel2001">Friedman-Schabel 2001</a>] or [<a class="ref" href="#marcolino2008">Marcolino 2008</a>]. Since these lists are the
                    starting point of the archive, one future goal is to solicit
                    new "question lists" encoded according to
                    an established schema wherein the editors of each list —
                    both the compiler of the original list and the encoder of
                    the data — are clearly credited for their work. Our current
                    working database includes eight such lists including over
                    1,300 indexed &lt;item&gt;s. There are, however,
                    approximately 1,000 possible lists and therefore tens of
                    thousands of question &lt;item&gt;s to be indexed. Depending
                    on the structure of the commentary in question, these
                    &lt;item&gt;s can be nested inside grouped sections,
                    typically distinctions or books: a relationship that will be
                    recorded in the extracted metadata. It is also possible that
                    information about individual diplomatic transcriptions,
                    including the folio numbers where this &lt;item&gt; of text
                    can be found, might be nested within a given item. This
                    foundational document will also include pointers to the
                    repository where the raw TEI text of each item and any
                    individual diplomatic transcriptions may be found. As part
                    of the transition from prototype to implementation, an XML
                    schema will need to be constructed to make sure each of
                    these files adheres to a recognizable standard. </div>

                    of the "rdfextraction.xsl" is that it not only

                    particular part of text (i.e. an &lt;item&gt;) is
                        "available,"
                    "in progress," or "not yet started." If a user

                    schema tailored to this specific genre of text — it is
                    possible to begin automatically harvesting all kinds of
                    information about the text itself. For example, when

                    tags are identified with unique standardized identifiers

                    authors, or the use of titles, references, quotations, or

                    of metadata from a thoughtfully TEI encoded edition is

                    simply run through the current texts it is assigned to

                    have been identified with agreed upon name IDs), and then
                    query the <cite class="title italic">Sentences Commentary Text

                    then use this custom list to generate a custom name

                        "projectdata.xml" file which includes a lot of
                    redundant information already contained in the archive, such
                    as the location of the text in institutional and development

                    by parsing the response, can access all the other pertinent

                    an entire commentary, but rather to curate a selection of
                    texts that are united by a common theme or subject matter.
                    For instance, suppose someone wants to present a selection
                    of texts by multiple authors on the topic of "baptism".
                    Suppose further that these various texts were edited by
                    several different editors and stored in various different
                    institutional repositories across the globe. Using the
                    archive, it is possible first to search for and select all
                    the texts that discuss "baptism". Subsequently, an
                    application can follow the metadata pointers to the location
                    of the raw source text and then (using more associated
                    metadata) display these texts chronologically. </div>

                    the metadata archive could be used to suggest connections

                    Future development on <cite class="title italic">LombardPress</cite> aims to create a suggested
                    readings list that identifies quotations or key words used

                    long-term sustainability of both the text and any particular

                    be a continual work in progress, which is simply the nature
                    of modern web development. Thus, through rigorous separation
                    of the text and the platform in which it is viewed, the text
                    can survive and remain accessible through all the

                    their own challenges, are not particularly difficult to
                    meet. With a little bit of funding, a small team of
                    developers could easily implement and augment the workflow
                    described above. The biggest challenge is contribution.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">One obvious hurdle is getting people to edit their texts
                    according to the TEI schema or in a format easily
                    convertible to TEI. However, I imagine that even if users
                    are allowed to submit in any format, and different scripts
                    are designed to harvest the metadata from the various
                    formats, people will still be reluctant to allow metadata to
                    be harvested from their ongoing work.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">In response to this concern, let me conclude with a couple of
                    pertinent facts about the above proposal. The first is that,
                    while it is possible for the archive to be a place to
                    actually host the XML files themselves, this is not its
                    primary function, and it is not necessary for the text to be
                    permanently handed over to a third party. In the end, the
                    ideal scenario would be for the raw texts to be deposited
                    into an editor's own institutional repository. In this case,
                    editors and projects managers can retain control over where
                    their files actually live. The second pertinent fact is that
                    individual editors can still control accessibility to these
                    texts by indicating their publication status in the
                    &lt;teiHeader&gt;. What we are primarily talking about here
                    is metadata abstraction. While the extraction will initially
                    need access to the raw text, it does not need permanent
                    access. Further, metadata tags regarding status of the text
                    and its publication license can alert users to the
                    availability of the text and individual editors can choose
                    whether or not to make the full text accessible to many or
                    to just a few. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">In sum, two dominant principles continue to guide the present
                    proposal. The first principle is a healthy appreciation for
                    the need to support and foster collaboration. To support
                    this collaboration, we need to create a finding aid that
                    gives people enough access to a text to become interested in
                    it. The second principle is an equally healthy respect for
                    an editor's desire to control the content he or she is
                    working on for both development and publication purposes. I
