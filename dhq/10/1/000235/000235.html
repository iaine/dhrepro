                <p>Classifying and categorizing the activities that comprise
                    "digital humanities" has been a longstanding area of
                    interest for many practitioners in this field, fueled by
                    ongoing attempts to define digital humanities both within
                    the academy and in the public sphere. The emergence of
                    directories that cross traditional disciplinary boundaries
                    has also spurred interest in categorization, with the
                    practical goal of helping scholars identify, for instance,
                    projects that take a similar technical approach, even if
                    their subject matter is vastly different. This paper tracks
                    the development of TaDiRAH, the Taxonomy of Digital Research
                    Activities in the Humanities developed by representatives
                    from DARIAH, the European cyberinfrastructure initiative,
                    and DiRT, a digital humanities tool directory. TaDiRAH was
                    created specifically to connect people with information on
                    DiRT and in a DARIAH-DE bibliography, but with the goal of
                    adoption by other directory-like sites. To ensure that
                    TaDiRAH would be usable by other projects, the developers
                    opened drafts for public feedback, a process which
                    fundamentally altered the structure of the taxonomy and
                    improved it in numerous ways. By actively seeking feedback
                    from the digital humanities community and reviewing data
                    about how the source taxonomies are actually used in order
                    to inform term selection, the development of TaDiRAH
                    provides a model that may benefit other taxonomy
                    efforts.</p>

                        resources in the DiRT directory and the DARIAH-DE

                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Since the inception of the DiRT Wiki
                            in 2008, the site has used an ad-hoc set of
                            categories. In its original form, each category
                            represented a wiki page where tools were listed. In
                            2010, a migration to the Drupal content management
                            system gave each tool its own profile page. However,
                            even under this new structure, the original
                            categories persisted as a way to organize the
                            individual profiles. Starting in late 2012, the DiRT
                            Directory undertook an assessment of its categories,
                            with the goal of identifying any gaps, phasing out
                            rarely-used terms, and adding new terms to better
                            reflect the scope and nature of the tools presented
                            in DiRT. Early investigation into how the categories
                            were being used produced striking results. Entire
                            classes of commonly-used digital humanities tools
                            were largely rendered invisible through the lack of
                            an obviously matching category. For instance,
                            optical character recognition (OCR) tools were
                            scattered between the categories of "data
                            conversion", "transcription", "data collection" and
                            "annotation". The DiRT categories clearly needed
                            revision; when an opportunity arose to collaborate
                            with DARIAH-DE on a taxonomy that could be shared
                            across multiple sites with different purposes, doing
                            so was clearly preferable to undertaking another
                            isolated effort.</div>

                            of TaDiRAH was a working group in DARIAH, the
                            European initiative to build a "digital research
                            infrastructure for the arts and humanities" (see
                            [<a class="ref" href="#romary2014">Romary 2014</a>]). This working group was concerned with
                            research and education and formed part of DARIAH-DE,
                            the German contribution to DARIAH. The group aimed
                            to establish a principled overview of the research
                            methods and procedures shared by humanities
                            scholars. Presented as prose, such an overview
                            (published in [<a class="ref" href="#reiche2014">Reiche, Becker, Bender, Munson, Schmunk, Schöch</a>] could help
                            newcomers understand the field more quickly and
                            could connect established and digital research by
                            demonstrating their fundamental methodological
                            similarities. Presented as a taxonomy or ontology,
                            the same overview would form the basis for discovery
                            systems for bibliographic references, tutorials or
                            research projects. The first use case for such a
                            taxonomy was DARIAH-DE's "Doing Digital Humanities"
                            public bibliography on Zotero <a class="noteRef" href="#d10e258">[1]</a>, which became a test bed

                        McCarty and Short's idea of the methodological commons.
                        Using the metaphor and the tool of "mapping" to
                        represent the complex "terrain" of the digital
                        humanities, McCarty &amp; Short (2002) suggest a map
                        which has the "methodological commons" at its center.
                        They define the methodological commons as "an
                        abstraction for the computational methods that the
                        various disciplines of application share", which
                        functions as a space of encounter between "disciplinary
                        groups" and "areas of learning". The research methods
                        are not named, but are represented through broad data
                        types with which they are associated, such as "narrative
                        text", "images", or "music". McCarty and Short's data
                        types are roughly equivalent to TaDiRAH's "Object"

                        proposed in 2000 a short list of "Scholarly Primitives"
                        of research, particularly in the humanities. Contrary to
                        McCarty and Short, Unsworth defines scholarly primitives
                        as "activities [which] are basic to scholarship across

                        Referring, Sampling, Illustrating, Representing.

                            the team began with an analysis of the existing DiRT
                            taxonomy and how it was applied across DiRT content.
                            That was followed by a series of mappings, starting
                            by mapping DiRT to DARIAH-DE, identifying and
                            resolving points of poor alignment. It was much more
                            challenging to map the results of the DiRT/DARIAH
                            alignment to the very granular art-humanities.net
                            taxonomy. Fortunately, the latter included detailed
                            scope notes which facilitated discussions and
                            decision-making throughout the process. The final
                            step before releasing TaDiRAH for public comment was
                            adding scope notes to all terms in the final draft.

                        was open for comments for a two-week period, where it
                        received over 60 comments from individuals outside the
                        project team. In addition, the team received multiple
                        emails pointing to published and unpublished work in the
                        area of digital humanities taxonomies. The comments
                        ranged from suggesting that scope notes be rephrased to
                        discussions about the best choice among a set of
                        near-synonyms to use as the label for an overall concept
                        ("scanning" vs. "imaging" vs. "digitizing" was the
                        subject of particularly active debate).</div>

                        specific techniques (such as "stylometry" and "topic

                        did much broader terms, like "publishing" and
                        "annotating". Multiple commenters pointed out this
                        issue, and recommended that "techniques" be moved to a
                        separate list. This was preferable to creating a third
                        level of the taxonomy, as it would be difficult in some
                        cases to unambiguously assign a technique to only one
                        parent term. Having a separate list for techniques had
                        the added benefit of better supporting the rapid
                        evolution of new techniques, without requiring constant
                        revision to the core TaDiRAH terms; like the "objects"

                        and asynchronous work. In early February 2014, the
                        taxonomy team opened a revised draft for feedback, this
                        time for a week. While there was still considerable
                        engagement (with over 20 external comments), comments in
                        the second round were mostly focused on smaller issues
                        of phrasing, and there were no fundamental challenges to
                        the structure of the taxonomy. Within a week after the

                        able to incorporate the proposed changes and release the

                            the work on TaDiRAH was originally viewed as part of
                            the ongoing cooperation between the research and
                            education working group of DARIAH and NeDiMAH, the
                            Network for Digital Arts and Humanities. NeDiMAH’s
                            goal is to "contribute to the classification and
                            expression of digital arts and
                            humanities"<a class="noteRef" href="#d10e760">[15]</a> by developing a
                            theoretically sound ontology that can classify work
                            in digital arts and humanities, thereby contributing
                            to its visibility and academic credibility.<a class="noteRef" href="#d10e766">[16]</a> Ontology development has
                            moved forward in collaboration with DARIAH as there
                            was a considerable overlap and synergy between the
                            two organizations. Developing this ontology is
                            necessarily more challenging and time-consuming than
                            developing TaDiRAH, which has a pragmatic
                            orientation. Nonetheless, the TaDiRAH team intends
                            to work with the NeDiMAH team to ensure that the
                            taxonomies are interoperable to the greatest extent
                            possible.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">TaDiRAH is currently available in
                        version 0.5 in several human-readable as well as
                        machine-readable forms. It has been implemented in
                        several different contexts, has been presented at
                        several high-profile venues (including the Digital
                        Humanities Conference, see [<a class="ref" href="#borek2014">Borek, Dombrowski, Perkins, Schöch 2014</a>] and the
                        Dublin Core Metadata Initiative Conference, see [<a class="ref" href="#perkins2014">Perkins, Dombrowski, Borek, Schöch 2014</a>], described in dh+lib (see
                        [<a class="ref" href="#dombrowski2014">Dombrowski2014</a>], and is likely to be adopted by more
                        projects. What can be learned from TaDiRAH's brief
                        history so far is that a bottom-up approach such as the
                        one adopted by TaDiRAH can work if a small but
                        sufficient number of people can be brought together to
                        collaborate on a common goal. In the context of a
                        taxonomy aiming to attain a certain level of consensus
                        from the community of potential users, it has been
                        essential to quickly publish and publicize preliminary
                        versions of the taxonomy in order to gain the broadest
                        range of feedback possible. This seems particularly true
                        in the context of a taxonomy that prioritizes pragmatic
                        adoption over theoretical soundness. The TaDiRAH team
                        has sought to learn as much as possible from previous
                        practical implementations in the same domain of digital
                        research methods in the humanities, while seeking to
                        address issues arising in projects that implement
                        TaDiRAH. We strongly believe that the best way to move
                        forward and learn more about the strengths and possible
                        limitations of TaDiRAH lies in actual experience with
                        using it in various contexts. In this sense, the value
                        of TaDiRAH and the true potential of the development
                        approach undertaken here will increase as more projects
                        adopt it and feed their experience into future versions
                        of TaDiRAH. </div>
