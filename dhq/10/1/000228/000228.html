                <p>This article argues for a speculative, exploratory approach to literary history
                    that incorporates information visualization early on into, and throughout, the
                    research process. The proposed methodology combines different kinds of expertise
                    — including that of fans and scholars in both literary studies and computer
                    science — in processing and sharing unique cultural materials. Working with a
                    vast fan-curated archive, we suggest tempering scholarly approaches to the
                    history of science fiction (SF) with fan perspectives and demonstrate how
                    information visualization can be incorporated into humanistic research
                    processes, supporting exploration and interpretation of little-known cultural
                    collections.</p>

                         [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>, 36]. Such collaborations require that we acknowledge the value of different

                    using visualizations solely to display the final "results" of our research,
                    we are experimenting with evolving interactive visualizations in tandem with our
                    research questions and ongoing investigations of Gibson’s untapped collection of
                    little-known materials. The visualizations are thus integral to our research
                        "process", shaping and being shaped by our research questions and
                    ongoing findings, and are not simply tools used as a means to an end. This
                    exploratory approach is necessary because very little is known about the primary
                    materials we are investigating. Moreover, we want to make visible our research
                    process as it is impacted by digital tools and to remain open to unforeseen
                    questions and research avenues that arise through our first-hand interactions

                    approach to genre, and we demonstrate how integrating information visualization
                    early on in the research process can support exploration and guide the
                    interpretation of vast, largely unknown literary collections. We begin by
                    introducing the Gibson anthologies and their unique characteristics before
                    describing our theoretical approach to investigating and classifying their
                    material contents, and the design considerations underlying our visualizations.
                    Because the focus of this paper is primarily on the value of visualizations
                    employed throughout the research process, we describe our initial visual
                    explorations and findings as well as new iterations of our visualizations as
                    they evolved. Finally, we identify the benefits and limitations of our approach

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The Bob Gibson anthologies of speculative fiction are unique compilations of SF
                    stories hand-crafted by Canadian collector and devoted SF fan, Bob Gibson
                    (1908-2001). Gibson harvested a wide range of science-fictional materials for
                    his more than 890 anthologies from primarily English-language magazines
                    published from the 1840s onwards.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e302">[1]</a> He then bound these materials
                    himself into unique compilations, illustrated many of his covers (see Fig. 1),
                    and provided for each anthology a hand-written table of contents, which —
                    significantly — includes symbols through which he rated the "SF content" of
                    the items he collected (see Fig. 2). Although Gibson left no key to these
                    symbols, we argue that his system of classification will help elucidate the
                    history of periodical-based SF. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The Gibson anthologies promise to be of scholarly importance for several reasons.
                    First, Gibson appears to have archived materials that are routinely neglected in
                    many scholarly histories of the SF genre. The Gibson anthologies contain a wide
                    range of literary forms (prose and verse, fiction and non-fiction, short
                    stories, comics, and serialized novels) and visual art (illustrations and
                    photographs) in what appears to be an attempt to archive cultural engagement
                    with science and speculation in many aesthetic forms. Rather than focusing on
                        "major" works, usually novels, written by
                        "major" authors, as many scholarly histories of the genre
                    do, Gibson is attentive to numerous literary and visual forms and a diverse
                    range of "major" and so-called "minor"
                    writers who published in popular periodicals, where, arguably, much
                    experimentation necessary to genre development took place. This means that
                    Gibson has amassed precisely the ephemeral materials that are "readily overlooked" in scholarly histories of the genre
                        [<a class="ref" href="#ashley2000">Ashley 2000</a>].<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e347">[3]</a> In radically expanding
                    the set of materials that "matter", Gibson’s anthologies offer an implicit
                    challenge to received histories of the genre. Moreover, his anthologies
                    destabilize existing characterizations of SF that are based on a miniscule
                    portion of published SF, especially in its earliest years, while neglecting an
                    abundance of materials that contribute to (but do not quite fit traditional
                    definitions of) SF. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In choosing to explore Gibson’s own assessment of the genre, we hope to
                    acknowledge the importance of fan perspectives more generally, but also to
                    highlight Gibson’s own contribution specifically. His anthologies must be
                    understood as the work of a particularly industrious fan, an active participant
                    in the robust tradition of SF fandom well-known for (among other things) playing
                    a key role in developing "resources for criticism"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#rabkin2004">Rabkin 2004</a>, 458]. However, even among this distinguished group, Gibson’s work stands out.
                    He was a lifelong collector, recognized by other collectors in the international
                    SF fan community as the one who "had the best stuff," and by university
                    librarians as a collector who single-handedly collected one of the largest

                    the way Gibson’s unique anthologies do. In fact, even an initial perusal of the
                    anthologies suggests that they have the potential to alter drastically our
                    understanding of early SF in particular. In the 167 anthologies containing works
                    published before 1930, that is, before SF is named as such and before the
                    emergence of pulp magazines devoted to this "new" genre, we
                    have already identified 83 women writers not mentioned in Everett Franklin
                    Bleiler’s authoritative bibliography of early SF<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e408">[5]</a>; their very presence in the Gibson anthologies offers a
                    substantial revision to accounts of early SF that see this history as dominated
                    by male writers. Of course, the contributions of these (and many other)
                    forgotten writers included in the anthologies cannot be fully assessed without
                    also assessing Gibson’s challenge to the definition of SF and its related genres
                    that led him to include these writers in the first place. </div>

Information visualization techniques
                    make visible patterns within data collections that are otherwise difficult or

                    that it can also facilitate more micro-level analyses. As Hayles suggests,
                    information visualization allows us "both to see large-scale

                    quantitative analyses of distant reading with the thoughtful, deliberative
                    interpretations of close reading. In addition, we are testing the extent to
                    which information visualization helps raise new research questions and

                    through Gibson’s archive even as it explores the use of information
                    visualization in generating new research questions, hypotheses, and
                    classifications. Of these two, necessarily entangled, experiments, this paper

                    of this little-known body of early SF. While we could track imagined
                    technological inventions or another widely recognized “novum” of more recent SF,

                    that we remain sensitive to the unique features of this under-studied moment in
                    the genre’s evolution. As Moretti himself notes, "when a new

                    adopts an evolutionary approach: Rabkin and Simon’s Genre Evolution Project
                    (GEP). The GEP tracks the evolution of American SF stories published from 1927
                    onwards through a relational database, which links individual works to major
                    historical events and keeps track of reprints and translations of stories as
                    evidence of their "survival" — unlike Moretti’s evolutionary approach,
                    which tracks the emergence and evolution of <em class="emph">formal features</em> rather
                    than stories. GEP is remarkable for its focus on periodical-based short stories,
                    its attention to the wider cultural context in which these stories were
                    published, and for its unique approach to developing keywords for each story.
                    However, because it begins with stories published in 1927, it effectively skips
                    over the messiest part of the genre’s evolution.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e511">[7]</a>
                    Moreover, the project’s definition of survival commits it to a major works/major

                    so-called minor works and writers in the genre’s development. In contrast, we

                    based on formal features to tackle the wide diversity spectrum of an emerging
                    genre. This approach is already showing the limitations of current scholarly
                    histories and classifications of early SF, most of which are based on the

                    However, teasing out and exploring the aspects that these systems make
                    invisible, exclude, and otherwise silently define are equally necessary if we
                    are to create what G. C. Bowker and S. L. Star call a "living classification"

                    parameters and limitations. We believe that the Gibson anthologies — with their
                    78 "SF content" symbols used by Gibson to classify each item<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e545">[8]</a> — offer
                    an opportunity to challenge existing classifications of SF and to explore new
                    and more flexible systems. The openness of the Gibson anthologies themselves
                    therefore guides our classification choices and our presentation of these
                    anthologies, which in turn forms the basis of our database structures and our
                    visualizations. However, we also recognize the need to compare Gibson’s

                    previous SF bibliographies, dictionaries, and encyclopedias, aiming for a system
                    that would allow us to classify the formal features, plot devices, and content
                    of the anthology items. Many compilations were rejected, as they provided only a
                    broad definition of SF, typically based on 20th-century texts<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e551">[9]</a>. Others provided a detailed
                    classification structure, but still focused on full-blown SF and/or canonical
                    novels, while using terms, such as cyberpunk and nanotechnology, that are
                    anachronistic to early/proto SF<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e569">[10]</a>. Similar anachronistic
                    terms, as well an understanding of "Hard SF" based on problematic
                    20th-century assumptions about scientific disciplines, inform the classification
                    structure used by GEP [<a class="ref" href="#rabkin2014">Rabkin and Simon 2014</a>]. Relying substantially on any
                    of these systems would superimpose modern definitions of SF onto the anthologies

                    takes into account early periodical publications, including stories and authors
                    that may only have been published once. His extensive bibliography covers over
                    3000 stories written between the third century BC and 1930, with most works
                    falling between 1870 and 1930. Bleiler also includes a list of nine major SF
                    motifs that are then divided into sub-motifs, all of which were developed using
                    terminology drawn from the stories that comprise his bibliography, thereby
                    minimizing the imposition of anachronistic terms (see Fig. 3). Bleiler’s system
                    allows us to categorize the diverse science-fictional items in each Gibson
                    anthology according to the nine major motifs, while also allowing us to account

                    tensions prove at least as productive as their points of similarity. For
                    example, like many other critics, Bleiler underestimates the importance of the
                    supernatural in early SF. This is reflected in the positioning of the
                    supernatural last among Bleiler’s major motifs and in the motif’s title: "Incidental supernatural motifs occasionally found,
                        particularly in the earlier works"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#bleiler1990">Bleiler 1990</a>, xviii]. Furthermore, this motif is the least
                    differentiated in Bleiler’s hierarchy; in contrast to other motifs, it contains
                    few sub-motifs (see Figure 3, highlighted in orange), thus limiting the
                    specificity with which supernatural elements can be coded through Bleiler. In
                    contrast, our preliminary analysis of the earliest subset of anthology items
                    shows that Gibson does not exclude the supernatural, but rather seems to suggest
                    its affinity with SF. In fact, many of the items in our subset include
                    supernatural elements together with more recognizable SF elements, such as
                    technology, medical developments, and/or experiences with other worlds or
                    planets. As we will show in our discussion section, such hybridity indicates
                    that the supernatural has haunted SF since its beginnings, and that it is modern
                    understandings, rather than the historical moment, that have sought to exclude
                    it. Consequently (and perhaps unsurprisingly) such stories, rigorously tracked
                    by Gibson, rarely occur in Bleiler’s bibliography. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Adopting Bleiler’s motifs does not mean that we neglect relationships such as the
                    one between SF and the supernatural, nor does it mean that we seek to override
                    Gibson’s classifications with Bleiler’s. Rather, the productive tension between
                    Bleiler’s and Gibson’s approaches to categorization highlights the need for
                    precisely the type of close analysis enabled by Gibson’s anthologies and our
                    visualizations. Moreover, we are not relying exclusively on Bleiler as a point
                    of comparison, as we are allowing trends in our data set itself to indicate when
                    new keywords, perhaps unique to this collection, are needed. These keywords are
                    being developed through our own reading of the stories, and so continue
                    Bleiler’s efforts to create keywords inductively from the SF content itself.
                    Maintaining an open space of interaction between existing systems (Bleiler and
                    Gibson) and our own emerging classification system allows us to apply multiple
                    lenses through which to zoom in on the messy areas of early SF that have been

                        strategies toward digital collections, moving beyond query-based search
                        interfaces. In our project, the ability to examine Gibson’s anthologies in
                        an exploratory way is essential because of the open-ended nature of the
                        research questions and because of the need for both researchers and
                        general-interest users to first familiarize themselves with this unknown
                        collection. We aim at addressing an open-ended interaction paradigm in the
                        design of our visualizations.</li></ul></div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">Our first visual explorations focused on cracking the Gibson code of symbols.
                    From our work in Special Collections, we suspected that the symbols served at
                    least two functions. Notes and marginalia left by Gibson indicate that he was
                    coding for "SF content" but also rating the stories
                    for the "quality" of such content. However, Gibson’s
                    notes do not explicitly outline the system of symbols, nor do they provide any
                    key. Given the sheer number of symbols (26) and the number of items (1513), even
                    in our relatively small subset of 72 anthologies (out of the total 890), we
                    brainstormed ways that visualizations might help us explore the meaning of
                    specific symbols and their relation to other similar-looking symbols. We
                    therefore relied on both literary studies and computer science perspectives on
                    the data and its conceptualization, eventually deciding to juxtapose anthology
                    items and their corresponding Gibson symbols with Bleiler’s motifs through a
                    radial visualization that correlates these motifs with Gibson’s symbols. The
                    resulting visual explorations are shown in Figures 4 – 7. As we will explain,
                    these visualizations helped us begin to characterize the Gibson symbols, helped
                    make the collection more accessible by beginning to clarify the contents of the
                    anthologies for users unfamiliar with the collection, and, last but not least,
                    invited further exploration while helping to generate new hypotheses, research
                    questions, and new iterations of visualizations designed to help us address
                    these new hypotheses and questions.</div>

                    diagram (left), which includes Gibson’s symbols at the centre and Bleiler’s
                    hierarchical motifs in the radiating branches, and is interlinked with a list of
                    anthology items (right), providing multiple points of entry to explore the
                    contents of the anthologies. The cluster of circles at the middle of the radial
                    tree diagram shows all of Gibson’s symbols present in our subset, with the size
                    of each symbol representing its frequency<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e712">[11]</a>; for example, we can see that the "dash" and
                    the letter "F" are the most frequent symbols used in our subset, as they
                    appear largest. The branches that radiate from centre of the diagram show
                    Bleiler’s hierarchical motifs, with the stroke weight of each radial branch
                    representing the frequency of the motif (measured by the number of corresponding
                    anthology items associated with the motif). The list to the right of the radial
                    tree diagram shows each anthology item’s symbol, title, author and publication
                    year with a cover image of the corresponding anthology. This list is an entry
                    point to more details about each item (e.g., a content summary and a link to the
                    original item, where available), while also revealing information about the
                    symbols when a particular symbol is selected. Any selection in one part of the
                    visualization will result in corresponding adjustments to all other parts that
                    invite possible hypotheses and/or interpretations. </div>

                    to a selected symbol, a particularly ambiguous Gibson symbol, which might either
                    be described as a conjoined "JF" or a stylized F with a tail. By reading
                    the individual stories marked with this symbol, one might suspect that this
                    symbol refers to "Juvenile Fiction" or "Fairytale", as it includes
                    titles such as "The Little Mermaid" and "Wyemarke and the Forest Fairies". However, the
                    visualization brings all these stories together onto one screen, which allows
                    for easy comparison and confirmation of the hypothesis. Although using database
                    queries might also lead to similar results, the visualization makes the
                    discovery much more accessible and immediately meaningful, because it allows the
                    user to see simultaneously how, for example, these fairytales intersect with
                    Bleiler’s motifs, how many other stories share this symbol, and what anthologies
                    and source magazines contain these stories. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">The simultaneous communication provided by the visualization is particularly
                    important for symbols that have hundreds of items associated with them, as in
                    the case of the "F" or "-" symbols. In order to decipher these symbols
                    without the help of the visualization, one would either have to retrieve dozens
                    of anthologies from Special Collections and peruse hundreds of stories, keeping
                    careful notes of any observable patterns, or scroll through database search
                    results, all while (again) manually keeping track of observable potential
                    patterns (which becomes difficult the more items one attempts to track). All
                    such work would have to be done before being able to develop — let alone confirm
                    — hypotheses about a symbol’s meaning. With the help of the visualization,
                    however, certain hypotheses are suggested by the simultaneous visual
                    intersection of variables (symbols and motifs, and story titles) and can be
                    quickly ruled out and/or validated. For example, in the case of the "F"
                    symbol, a perusal of the abstracts and motifs provided in the visualization
                    reveals that this symbol is not likely related to the stylized F (or JF) that
                    signifies fairytales or juvenile fiction, as the stories associated with the
                        "F" symbol are much more eclectic, tend to deal with ghosts,
                    disappearances and mysteries, and are directed at a more adult audience. This
                    prompted us to look into the "F" symbol items further, and with the
                    guidance of Gibson’s marginalia, we now believe that this symbol refers to
                        "Fortean" stories, stories that focus on unexplainable observed
                    phenomena. Returning to the visualization and perusing the motifs and abstracts
                    of stories labeled with this symbol confirms this hypothesis. In the cases of
                    both the stylized F or JF and the plain "F" symbols, it is clear that
                    visualization is effectively incorporated into the research <em class="emph">process</em>
                    (which includes more traditional humanistic modes of inquiry such as archival
                    work), even at its earliest, most exploratory stages, and not, as is often the
                    case, used solely as a way to showcase <em class="emph">results</em> visually. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">In addition to Gibson symbols, the visualization offers Bleiler motifs as another
                    point of entry to Gibson’s anthologies. The nine branches of Bleiler’s hierarchy
                    are named in the text that surrounds the radial diagram (for comparison, refer
                    to Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) and, as mentioned, the stroke weight of each radial branch
                    represents the frequency of the motif. While Bleiler’s numbered hierarchy
                    suggests an order of importance, moving from the first ranked category,
                    Ultimates, to the last, Incidental Supernatural Motifs, we intentionally laid
                    out the hierarchy in a radial geometry that does not privilege certain motifs
                    over others so that the anthologies themselves could suggest the significance of
                    certain motifs over others. Selecting a motif highlights its corresponding
                    branches (in orange) and filters the item list to show all stories associated
                    with the selected motif and its sub-motifs, while the Gibson symbols in the
                    middle circle are adjusted to show their distribution within this motif
                    selection. For example, Figure 6 shows that, so far, 521 of 1513 items in our
                    subset are associated with the motif branch "Incidental Supernatural
                        Motifs" and that that this motif is related to 19 of Gibson’s symbols.
                    Here, the motif to which Bleiler granted the least importance appears in
                    Gibson’s anthologies to be the most prominent.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Moreover, the visualization shows how the motifs inter-relate. When a motif is
                    selected, blue branches represent sub-motifs that co-occur with the selected
                    motif across at least one anthology item (see Fig. 6). Using the blue branches
                    as a guide to correlations, several motif branches can be selected at once in
                    order to trace connections between motifs, their associated items, and the
                    Gibson symbols. For example, while one might expect that the supernatural
                    remains only distantly related to the development of SF (at least since Darko
                    Suvin’s highly influential definition of the genre, SF has typically been
                    defined against the supernatural), this visualization of the Gibson collection
                    suggests that supernatural motifs are everywhere associated with more common SF
                    motifs, including technology and a number of sciences, such as Astronomy and
                    Astrophysics (see Fig. 7). This becomes apparent by selecting the "Incidental
                        Supernatural Motifs" branch and noting that almost all other branches
                    co-occur with the supernatural. This in itself is a significant finding in that
                    it points to possible hybrid genres that likely contributed to the evolution of
                    SF as we know it and challenges critical attempts to separate SF from other
                    contributing genres. It also raises questions about the longevity of some of
                    these sub-genres, which led us to incorporate an interactive timeline into later
                    iterations of the visualization. </div>

                    research questions that arose as we interacted with the early visualization. We
                    have also re-designed the entry point to the visualization to reflect the
                    interpretative character of our visualization approach to the Gibson collection;
                    the letters composing the new title of our visualization interface are from
                    Gibson’s anthology covers themselves and thus show how our approach borrows from

                    anthology covers with Gibson’s original tables of contents and artwork; clicking
                    on an anthology cover in the item view brings up a high resolution image of this
                    very cover. We have also since incorporated another view of Bleiler’s motifs
                    into the visualization in the form of a tag cloud. Once again challenging
                    Bleiler’s own hierarchy, the frequency of the keywords across Gibson’s items
                    determines the size of the keyword tag, rather than the numerical order created
                    by Bleiler, and each of these tags reflects a node in the radial diagram. While
                    the radial diagram is easily used by scholars familiar with Bleiler’s motifs,
                    the cloud allows general-interest users to scan quickly through the most
                    relevant keywords for the Gibson anthologies. Clicking on a word highlights the
                    node, just as clicking on a node highlights the word in the tag cloud. Following
                    the feedback of our users, we also added a connecting line between the node and
                    keyword that appears when the user hovers over the node, thus emphasizing
                    further the connection between these two views. Just as with the radial diagram,
                    the tag cloud adjusts based on any filters utilized, and when a motif is
                    selected, only co-occurring motifs remain in the cloud. Our visualizations are
                    therefore evolving and developing along with our research process, and are
                    engaged in a continual effort to meet the needs of the tool’s diverse audiences.
                    The Specultative W@nderverse in its current form can be considered a milestone
                    in our process, but not a final result – further visualization experiments that
                    focus, for example, on incorporating more strongly the material and visual
                    aesthetics of the Gibson anthologies, will follow.</div>

                    particularly true when grappling with an unusually long-lived genre. As Moretti
                    notes in passing while discussing the average longevity of different genres, SF
                    is unique in that it has lasted for more than 100 years with no sign of abating
                        [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>, 31] – unlike most other genres, which he
                    found lasted about 25-30 years on average [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>, 20].
                    This longevity and the great diversity of works considered part of the SF genre
                    suggests the need to consider historically-specific (and thus changing)
                    sub-genres, hybrid genres, and micro-genres of what might be considered a
                    complex mega-genre uniquely characteristic of modernity. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">While expansive — but certainly not exhaustive — the Gibson collection offers
                    possible ways to begin characterizing the vast array of periodical-based SF as
                    it changed over time. We will continue to compare his choices with those of
                    scholars and to consider the limitations of his collection. This pilot study,
                    focusing on 72 of the total 890 Gibson anthologies, begins with the earliest
                    works compiled by Gibson (starting in the 1840s through to the early 1900s).
                    Even this more modest time period entails going through more than a thousand
                    items. The current exploratory visualizations (which continue to evolve and
                    result in new visualization experiments) and the process of developing them have
                    certainly assisted us in beginning to characterize the anthologies and to
                    understand their potential contribution to SF studies. However, they also
                    highlight the messiness inherent in the evolution of genres that might be
                    obscured by neatly organized, result-oriented static visuals that seem to
                    promise self-evident conclusions. For example, we have several items that occur
                    within the Gibson anthologies that cannot be coded with any of Bleiler’s motifs,
                    and so become difficult to represent within our current
                        visualizations<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e867">[13]</a>. We are also aware that different
                    research questions or interests would necessarily create different
                    classifications for the Gibson items than the ones that we are applying. Our
                    tool is thus best understood as a particular lens that allows us to zoom in on
                    the messy period of proto-SF, offering a view that must be tempered with the
                    views of existing and ongoing SF scholarship. This means recognizing that our
                    tool, no less than any other interpretation of the period, comes with its own
                    exclusions and limitations. We therefore maintain that, more than simply
                    providing certain kinds of results (such as helping to decipher the Gibson
                    symbols), developing and incorporating interactive visualizations throughout a
                    research process inevitably showcases the limitations of one’s choices at every
                    step, the multiplicity of approaches possible and the multitude of questions
                    that splinter into further questions, without ever suggesting the
                    incontestability or stability of results.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">The deciphering of Gibson symbols continues to rely both on our careful perusal
                    of Gibson’s marginalia and any clues we may find therein and on the
                    visualizations that help suggest and test a variety of hypotheses about their
                    meaning. In this case, the visualizations effectively work in tandem with more
                    traditional modes of archival work. The rethinking of definitions and
                    categorizations of SF is a more fraught process, in part because it everywhere
                    leads to the limitations both of early scholarly attempts and of the current
                    attempt, but such rethinking also offers a sobering check that balances the
                    promise of definitive knowledge, which implicitly comes with attempts to account
                    for the "great unread". </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">The visualizations have perhaps been most successful in helping to refine and
                    rethink research questions and possible ways to work towards answers. We began
                    this project with fairly broad questions about how a fan-curated collection
                    might contribute to scholarly understandings of the history of SF. However, as
                    we gathered and began to visualize data from the collection, we started to think
                    through the differing perspectives of the diverse audiences the tool might reach
                    and we began to ask more clearly articulated questions. Some questions directly
                    responded to the early visualization, such as: 1) What are the relationships or
                    points of contrast between two particular symbols? or 2) How could we better
                    represent the interaction between Gibson’s classifications and those of Bleiler
                    through the visualization? Such questions led to changes to the visualization
                    itself through both our radial tree diagram and our tag cloud. Other questions
                    were suggested by our interactions with the visualization as we attempted to
                    decipher the Gibson symbols. These include, for example: 1) Are certain Gibson
                    symbols more commonly associated with certain source magazines and/or with
                    certain authors and/or time periods? 2) Do Gibson’s symbols and/or Bleiler’s
                    motifs suggest specific hybrid or sub-genres of SF that are specific to
                    particular decades and/or periodicals? 3) Is there a difference between the
                    kinds of topics treated by male or female writers? Such questions emerged from
                    the ease with which the visualization provides simultaneous information on
                    multiple variables and led us to incorporate more targeted filters mentioned
                    above. As our questions narrow, we are also considering whether we should
                    maintain a tool that tries to address both public and academic audiences
                    simultaneously, or whether the increasing specificity of our research questions
                    will eventually necessitate multiple separate tools. As we think of new
                    iterations and/or new separate visualizations, we are also considering questions
                    for future research, including: 1) Could we develop a way to compare Gibson’s
                    selections from specific periodicals with the materials he rejected from these
                    same periodicals in order to better understand his selection process? 2) How can
                    we include images of Gibson’s notes and marginalia in the visualizations so as
                    to promote the analysis of his editorial function? 3) How can we further
                    represent the material qualities of Gibson’s unique hand-crafted anthologies in
                    the visualization?</div>

                    the untapped Gibson anthologies to showcase specifically the value of
                    incorporating visualization early on into the research process, when research is
                    arguably in its most exploratory stages. This approach is in direct alliance
                    with our developing methodology, which takes inspiration from Moretti’s
                    attention to the evolution of genres through stylistic mutations, even while
                    adapting his approach in order to include expert amateur knowledge and to
                    integrate visualizations <em class="emph">throughout the research process</em> (not just
                    to support an argument about results). Furthermore, we utilize open-ended data
                    explorations in developing more flexible classification systems of SF. Based on
                    the premise that, as many have noted, "we think through, with, and alongside media"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hayles2012">Hayles 2012</a>, 1], this pilot project specifically showcases that the interactive
                    co-development of tool and research processes can be fruitful, especially in
                    fostering discoveries in complex, little-known collections. While the benefits
                    of displaying empirical research results through visualizations are well-known
                    and visualizations have historically been called upon to serve this purpose more
                    than any other [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2014">Drucker 2014</a>], the use of interactive
                    visualizations to help researchers and non-researchers experiment and play with
                    collected data is increasingly recognized.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e902">[14]</a>
                    Developing visualizations collaboratively (with scholars in both literary
                    studies and computer science) promotes creative play and problem-solving across
                    disciplines, and allows for visualizations that are uniquely suited to the
                    collection under study. If the trend in DH seems to be toward developing generic
                    tools that are applicable to almost any data set, we argue that there is also
                    room for tools tailored to the specific questions raised by utterly unique
                    collections that may be of interest both within and beyond scholarly circles.
                    While we recognize that such an approach is resource-intensive, it also promises
                    a more substantial pay-off for a wider, mixed-expertise audience.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8899e909">[15]</a>
