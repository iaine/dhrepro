                <p>Historians have argued that nationalism spread from elite groups to larger
                    populations through public media, yet this has never been empirically proven. In
                    this paper, we use digital tools to search for expressions of nationalism in
                    Dutch newspaper discourse in the late nineteenth century by text mining in large
                    newspaper repositories. The absence of emotional nationalist rhetoric in Dutch
                    national newspapers suggests that nationalism in the late nineteenth century was
                    much more subtle than the literature based on elite discourse tells us.</p>

                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In the nineteenth century, the French philosopher Ernest Renan took up an
                    important question of his day in a lecture at the Sorbonne. His classical text,
                    which resulted from that lecture,<cite class="title italic"><span class="foreign i">
                            Qu’est-ce qu’une nation?, </span></cite>is seen as one of the first
                    attempts to define nations scientifically. Renan disagreed with many before him
                    who had defined the nation by criteria such as race or ethnic group or common
                    characteristics. Instead, he defined a nation by the desire of people to belong
                    together, their willingness to share a mutual past and a common future.
                    Therefore, he declared, the existence of the nation was based on daily approval
                    of this shared desire by its members [<a class="ref" href="#renan1992">Renan 1992</a>, 41–4].
                    Historians since then have offered numerous theories explaining what made
                    allegiance to the nation-state, or nationalism, possible among groups. Key among
                    the mechanisms cited are newspapers. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2"> This paper contributes to the existing literature on nationalism by testing the
                    thesis that asserts the importance of newspapers to rising nationalism. It will
                    do this by approaching the question in a new way using digital tools. Using text
                    mining to answer this question is not an attempt to define or redefine
                    nationalism. Instead we rely on existing literature to establish the outlines of
                    our investigation including the hypotheses regarding the role of newspapers in
                    nationalism that we set out to test. Existing literature has primarily based its
                    study of the nation on elite discourse. As a result, the creation of the modern
                    nation has been described as the process of the transmission of high culture to
                    society at large. Because digital tools allow us unprecedented access to the
                    contents of digitized newspapers, in this paper, we use the affordances of
                    digital tools to study a less elite view of nationalism in the late nineteenth
                    century than is found in existing academic literature on the topic. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Indeed, adopting this viewpoint answers the call of many historians. In a recent
                    essay, John Breuilly highlighted the elite bias of nationalism studies as a
                        "major deficit" in the field [<a class="ref" href="#breuilly2012">Breuilly 2012</a>, 23].
                    According to Breuilly, existing studies focus overwhelmingly on either elite
                    discourse or on politics. Often, the two concerns are merged into a single
                    narrative that stresses the importance of elite discourse in shaping the
                    mind-sets of nationalist politicians. Insofar as a nationalism studies considers
                    the popular meaning of nationalism and its development within a broader sphere,
                    this tends to be based on unproven inferences. Yet in the evidence that existing
                    studies cite – high turnouts at nationalist festivals and ceremonies, the
                    popular backing of nationalist politicians or the high numbers of volunteers for
                    military service – one catches glimpses of a larger public audience that not
                    only responded to but also shaped the meanings of nation and nationalism. We are
                    concerned in this paper with tracing nationalism as presented to a larger
                    audience through newspapers. Following Hobsbawm’s earlier assertion, that
                    nationalism "is constructed essentially from above, but (…) cannot
                            be understood unless also analyzed from below, that is in terms of the
                            assumptions, hopes, needs, longings an interest of ordinary
                            people"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hobsbawm2012">Hobsbawm 2012</a>, 10], we will use the power of digital methods to investigate nationalism from
                    below. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4"> Existing theories, such as those by Anderson, Hobsbawm, and Gellner, lead us to
                    expect nationalism to have been spread in the late nineteenth century through
                    the frequent presence of telling phrases in newspapers that invoke the greatness
                    of a nation and its history [<a class="ref" href="#anderson1983">Anderson 1983</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#hobsbawm2012">Hobsbawm 2012</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#gellner2008">Gellner 2008</a>]. According to Benedict Anderson, newspapers with
                    national circulation were crucial to the creation of imagined national
                    communities by disseminating the idea of nationhood. In his view, the nation
                    should be understood not as a geographical or political entity, but as an
                    imagined community united by a "deep, horizontal comradeship" whereby
                    national co-fellows are believed to constitute a bounded, natural entity.
                    Anderson argues that the nation emerges out of imaginative contexts of social
                    and cultural experience. Regular, synchronic readings of daily or weekly
                    newspapers produced the idea among readers that they shared a set of interests
                    and were part of an imagined community. Newspapers were thus a chief way that
                        " the imagined world is visibly rooted in everyday life"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#anderson1983">Anderson 1983</a>, 7, 25, 36]. Although, as Tim Edensor has
                    argued, Anderson’s focus on printed media to the exclusion of all else is a very
                    reductive view of culture, which encompasses much more than just newspapers,
                    newspapers have consistently been singled out as important to rising nationalism
                    in the late nineteenth century [<a class="ref" href="#edensor2002">Edensor 2002</a>, 7–17]. So it is
                    very much worth testing the hypothesis that newspapers contributed to
                    nationalism. Our digital examination of the content of Dutch newspapers is a
                    crucial contribution to understanding the nature of the "nationalist"
                    content of newspapers. By studying the spread of nationalist sentiment through
                    public discourse, we hope to be able to better understand the role of newspapers
                    in the spread of nationalism.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Theories of nationalism suggested by other authors offer an alternative to the
                    emphasis on emotional rhetoric. Another model of how nationalism was spread, for
                    example, is offered by the British social psychologist Michael Billig. He argues
                    nationalism was spread, not via the impassioned rhetoric of elite discourse, but
                    by building a common identity through everyday expressions. Instead of the
                        "passionate and exotic examples" often given of the spread of
                    nationalism, Billig draws attention to the routine and mundane reproduction of
                    the idea of the nation that is necessary to maintain it over time. He points,
                    for example, to the use of national flags in everyday contexts, differentiating
                    between what he calls the "waved" flags at national sporting events and the
                        "unwaved flags" that he sees as a more important daily reminder of
                    national belonging. Thus a person walking into the supermarket and seeing a
                    national flag on a milk carton, even if they are looking for something else,
                    will be unconsciously reminded of his national identity. Billing makes the same
                    argument for the increasing use of pronouns like "we" that are used as a
                    signifier of "us" as members of the nation and indeed the increasing use of
                    nations’ names in the public domain. Nationalism, for Billig, is marked by the
                    fact that phrases like "the economy", "the government" and "the
                        countryside" are immediately and unconsciously translated by readers as
                        "our economy, government and countryside". This then constitutes an
                    important part of the way in which nations are <em class="emph">naturalised</em>, or
                    absorbed into a common-sense view about the way the world is. In this way they
                    are also invested with moral values, which elevate the national over other
                    social groupings [<a class="ref" href="#billig1995">Billig 1995</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#skey2009">Skey 2009</a>]. Billig’s notion of banal nationalism supports the
                    argument of Niek van Sas, who asserts in his well-respected study of nationalism
                    in the Netherlands, that nationalism was much more subtle in the years around
                    1900 than we might expect [<a class="ref" href="#vansas2004">van Sas 2004</a>, 161–2]. Others have
                    cited the development and further standardization of language and the use of
                    certain words and concepts to describe certain events, customs or practices as
                    national as important contributions that newspapers have made to forging a
                    national identity [<a class="ref" href="#baycroft2004">Baycroft 2004</a>, 9–10]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#lodge1993">Lodge 1993</a>, 2–3]. By analysing popular discourse in national
                    newspapers using digital methods, we want to judge whether emotional nationalist

                    literature about the nature of nationalist discourse (emotional or banal) in the
                    late nineteenth century in national Dutch newspapers. To carry out our test, we
                    first used topic modelling to try to capture the content of newspaper articles.
                    We used topic modelling for its ability to produce pseudo-semantic information
                    in the presence of <em class="term">OCR</em> errors (which beset our corpus and made
                    tools from corpus linguistics, as discussed below, difficult to use). The fact
                    that we did not find emotional, nationalist rhetoric in Dutch newspapers in the
                    late nineteenth century was very revealing, for it suggests that nationalism,
                    which the literature agrees was present at this time, was expressed in
                    newspapers not using grandiose, emotional appeals, but in more subtle ways. This
                    also implies that the emotional nationalism that is so often commented on—and
                    blamed for leading to the First World War [<a class="ref" href="#clark2013">Clark 2013</a>]—was formed
                    outside of newspapers and reflected in them, rather than being formed in
                    newspapers. Newspapers, in other words, were important to spreading nationalism,
                    but as a reinforcement of things that happened elsewhere. To check the
                    reasonableness of our findings from topic modelling, we both close read a
                    significant number of articles and tried to carry out a linguistic analysis of

                    of nationalism in the late nineteenth century, but it is also the period when
                    public debate about Dutch national identity was most strongly polarized [<a class="ref" href="#aerts1999">Aerts and te Velde 1999</a>]. We chose 1870 as our start date to avoid the most
                    serious effects of the national newspaper tax in the Netherlands, which was
                    abolished in 1869. The tax served to restrict access to newspapers as well as
                    discourage their publication. Yet over time, average incomes went up, the price
                    of papers declined and literacy rates went up. After 1870, the Dutch media
                    landscape became more and more fragmented and journals and newspapers became the
                    most important vehicles of new views and opinions [<a class="ref" href="#vanvree2000">van Vree 2000</a>]

                    is divided about the precise relationship of the public sphere to the newspaper
                    reporting, the use of newspapers as sources brings with it the promise of being

                    literature that has been focused on the creation of large nations within Europe:
                    France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Although the Dutch nation had
                    existed as a political or organizational entity for many decades before 1870 –
                    the first national anthem was chosen in 1815 – a national identity was weak
                    among the Dutch early on. Privileges like raising taxes, setting rules,
                    organizing their own political and religious organisations were guarded
                    jealously by local cities and communities. It was in the nineteenth century that
                    the liberal elite of the Netherlands came to the conclusion that that
                    strengthening national identity was a good way to prevent the country from
                    falling apart into different fractions, as the Catholics and Orthodox
                    Protestants were making strong claims to their rights as religious communities.
                    Although neither Catholic nor Protestant elites willingly tried to subvert
                    national solidarity, the country’s liberal elite felt threatened by each group’s
                    divergent views of the history of the Netherlands and their claims about the
                    country’s future. The elite therefore became shepherds of national unity,
                    campaigning to define and reinforce a Dutch national identity. Central to this
                    effort was the promotion of royalty: the House of Orange, and especially the
                    young princess, Wilhelmina, who was crowned on 6 September 1898, a few days
                    after her eighteenth birthday [<a class="ref" href="#bank1992">Bank and van Buuren 1992</a>, 21–89]

                    1870-1914, the collection grows from 2500 newspaper issues published in 1870 to
                    more than 6000 in 1914. While this quantity is helpful for research, mining the

                    they can be analysed separately. Second, the quality of the OCR is poor. This
                    makes it hard to analyse these newspapers using sophisticated techniques that
                    rely on the semantic information provided by full sentences. Figure 1 shows a

                    was divided into large empires, some constitutional monarchies and a large

                    national identity. The Dutch Republic of the eighteenth century was a union
                    based purely on military needs. It was only in times of war that the seven
                    provinces that made up the Republic deliberated together on strategy and
                    finance. Outside of wartime, regional and local communities were mostly
                    self-governing. In 1795, the Batavian Revolution abolished the republic entirely
                    and created a central state. The revolution declared national unity for the
                    first time. After an interlude as part of France, the Kingdom of the Netherlands
                    was proclaimed and inherited this unity. After this, there was a tendency
                    towards a single national identity, but local identities remained strong and
                    local customs, laws and regulations were hard to circumvent [<a class="ref" href="#skinner1989">Skinner 1989</a>]

                    problem of defining a unique national identity. In 1848, the northern region of
                    the "nation" adopted a liberal constitution and local identities were
                    slowly forged into a singular national identity. A new field of "national

                    was by studying the discourse around events identified in the historical
                    literature as "nationalist". Events were useful in our search for relevant
                    articles because they offered a focus point for public discourse about
                    nationalism – and a way to translate a complex concept into something that a
                    computer could find. We used a time period that spanned two years before and
                    after each event in question. Although we avoided the need to define nationalism
                    ourselves by drawing on existing literature, the choice of events nevertheless
                    implicitly defined it. Such events might have been instigated by elites, but
                    they undoubtedly involved the populace. Because, following Aerts, we expected to
                    see a change in the tone of Dutch nationalism over time, we compared articles
                    reporting on a nationalist event in 1872 with articles about an event in 1898.
                    The first was the commemoration of the landing at Den Briel. The landing at Den
                    Briel took place in April 1572, so 1872 marked the tercentenary of the invasion
                    of Den Briel, which was in 1572 under Spanish control - an important turning
                    point in the Eighty Year’s War. The second event that we used was the

                        with nationalism; its words describe crime. Topics 15, 23 and 31 consisted
                        only of individual letters.</div></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17"> Limiting the corpus of articles modelled has two advantages: first, it makes the
                    number of articles more manageable, and second, it emphasizes the themes of
                    interest to historians – particularly in a corpus like ours made up of many
                    (potentially short) newspaper articles. A key problem with topic modelling is
                    that most computers are not able to model large numbers of documents containing
                    a large number of words. This restricts the ability of historians to use this
                    tool because it forces them to rely on others with larger computers. Using an
                    undifferentiated corpus, while desirable from a numerical point of view (the
                    desire to use as many documents as possible to increase the method’s accuracy),
                    is also problematic because common statistical measures of significance like
                        <em class="term">tf/idf</em> (topic frequency – inverse document frequency) are not
                    necessarily useful for inferring historical meaning and may incorrectly
                    emphasize or deemphasize words in shorter articles, as are typical in a
                    newspaper [<a class="ref" href="#giffard2015">Giffard 2015</a>]. Furthermore, the use of a large,
                    undifferentiated corpus may lead to the elimination of topics that are of
                    interest to historians if other topics are discussed more frequently. Because
                    topic modelling an entire corpus might not allow researchers to explore obscure
                    topics, researchers should use a more limited corpus. Such a corpus can help
                    researchers avoid this problem because a limited corpus can be chosen so as to
                    contain the concept of interest to a degree that is of statistical import.
                    Defining a smaller corpus also gives the researcher greater control over what
                    sources are included in it, enabling the researcher to take steps to avoid bias,
                    for example [<a class="ref" href="#blaxill2013">Blaxill 2013</a>, 320–1].</div>

                    searches in a time period about two years before and two years after the event
                    in question. To create two corpuses, we used the two search queries:

                    modelling are hard to define and are different for each case; we used the same
                    settings for our LDA topic analysis in each case (same number of iterations,
                    topics, topic size, and same importance threshold) in order to reduce one more
                    variable from our analysis. These choices could pose additional interpretive
                    problems because more newspapers – and therefore more articles – came into being
                    over time (so one would expect more "recent" events to be discussed in a
                    greater number of articles), but we judged the subset that our search returned
                    to be representative. In all of our tests, we relied on the existing metadata in
                    the national collection to define newspapers with "national" or
                        "regional" circulation as well as "articles" rather than
                        "advertisements". For each event corpus, we modelled the content of the
                    article including its title, but removed other metadata such as the title of the
                    newspaper. The results are given below:</div>

                    find a different way of limiting our corpus than by events. Tracing a concept is

                    finding a non-event based corpuses was similarly more complicated. We wanted to
                    avoid defining "nationalism" too strictly in order to let the sources
                    speak, so we looked for quasi-objective keywords to limit our corpus. Literature
                    on Dutch nationalism tells us that the terms <span class="foreign i">"vaderland"</span>, <span class="foreign i">"volk"</span>, and <span class="foreign i">"natie"</span>
                    did not change much in meaning over the last quarter of the nineteenth century
                        [<a class="ref" href="#aerts1999">Aerts and te Velde 1999</a>]. So we adopted these words as search terms. We
                    began by creating a "nationalist" sub-corpus defined by articles containing
                    the keyword <span class="foreign i">"vaderland"</span> in national

                    was often incorrectly OCR’d as the Dutch word "hier" [here], thus adding
                    numerous articles to the corpus that did not actually have to do with beer. This
                    was judged to be an acceptable mix-up in this case because we were searching for

                    in both corpuses. Yet the language used to describe the war was clearly
                    different in the two sub-corpuses: the first focused more on "ethnic"
                    descriptors rather than the more "news"-like words of the second corpus.
                    The second topic we chose was trade, another important theme with regard to the
                    Netherlands. In the <span class="foreign i">"vaderland"</span>-corpus, we
                    found that the topic was expressed using "national" terms – particularly
                    referring to foreign nations, which we would expect to see in a world beginning
                    to organize itself by nation-states [<a class="ref" href="#anderson1983">Anderson 1983</a>, 95–8].
                    The most similar topic in the <span class="foreign i">"bier"</span>-corpus, in contrast, uses more general words. It was
                    interesting that the two corpuses had unique vocabularies for discussing
                    similarly important events. This too suggests that nationalism in newspapers was
                    expressed through the constant presence of more banal mechanisms that suggest a
                    larger change in how the world was organised and understood. Although the

                    concerned with nations than the more general <span class="foreign i">"bier"</span> corpus, we did not see any emotional, nationalist

                    newspapers not through the presence of emotional rhetoric, but in the use of a
                    vocabulary that changed over time. Indeed, many authors have pointed to
                    linguistic changes, such as the increasing use of the term "national" or
                    references to national organizations, that indicate the growth of national
                    identity, so we tried to use these changes to track the process of national
                    identity building in Dutch newspapers. Seeing an increase of such changes over
                    time would indicate increasing intensity of personal association with a national
                    grouping, in this case the Netherlands, as opposed to local groupings, such as
                    the Dutch provinces. Although our attempts at linguistic analysis were
                    suggestive but ultimately unsuccessful, we will shortly describe the major tests
                    that we carried out and the problems that we faced in trying to come to
                    conclusive answers.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">Firstly, we used ngrams to track the usage of keywords that refer to nation
                    states over time. The frequency of words like <span class="foreign i">"Nederland"</span> [the Netherlands], but also <span class="foreign i">"Tweede Kamer"</span> [the Dutch parliament], <span class="foreign i">"Premier"</span> [prime minister], <span class="foreign i">"nationaal"</span> [national], <span class="foreign i">"vaderland"</span> [fatherland], and <span class="foreign i">"Nederlands"</span> [Dutch] did indeed rise over the nineteenth
                    century. We hoped to be able to compare this increasing usage with the number of
                    references made to local organizational forms, since we would expect local
                    organizational forms to be replaced by national ones. Words that refer to local
                    communities, however, like the names of the different Dutch provinces, hardly
                    decreased over the period in question (See Figure 3).</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Although trying to search for these words did not yield the results we hoped for,
                    it suggested that we might find something if we compared word usage in
                    newspapers with local as opposed to national circulation. The results were
                    disappointing, however. The term <span class="foreign i">"provincie"</span> [province] for instance appears almost as
                    frequently in national as regional newspapers. Between 1870 and 1914, the term
                        <span class="foreign i">"provincie"</span> appears 85,583 times in
                    national papers and 112,307 in regional papers – but more regional newspapers
                    have been digitized and this number is constantly changing, one reason why using
                    a limited sub-corpus gives the researcher more control. It would perhaps be more
                    fruitful to examine how many newspaper column inches were devoted to national as
                    opposed to regional news or discourse, but that relies on being able to use a
                    computer to distinguish between national and regional news. Ultimately, however,
                    although a graph of linguistic use over time seems to suggest an increase in
                    reference to national units, this is difficult to translate into information
                    about personal identity as opposed to just bureaucratic organisation. That the
                    national should be increasingly referred to was not unexpected given that
                    citizens would be expected to increasingly have intercourse with national
                    organizations as these are established. These results, while suggestive, show
                    the difficulty of translating historical questions into questions that can be
                    answered using digital methods – or conversely, of limiting our historical
                    questions to questions that can be answered using digital methods. </div>

                    experiments turned up evidence of emotional, nationalist rhetoric in Dutch
                    newspapers in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Instead, we saw
                    indications that nationalism was spread through much more quotidian methods. So,
                    following Billig, we looked particularly at the use of pronouns in newspaper
                    articles. Because such subtle expressions of nationalism would be expected to
                    occur in any and all types of article – whether about national politics, sports
                    or the weather – our examination used the whole corpus (so all articles for the
                    time period under study). But subtle changes such as the references of pronouns
                    are difficult to mine for. It is easy to see that the number of articles that
                    contain both the word <span class="foreign i">"Nederland"</span>
                    [Netherlands] and the pronoun <span class="foreign i">"wij"</span> [we]
                    was on the rise in the nineteenth century, for example (See Figure 4). Also, one
                    finds that nationalist word combinations like Billig’s <span class="foreign i">"ons land"</span> [our land] were used more frequently in 1900
                    than 1870 (See Figure 5). Like the previous linguistic tests, the graphs given
                    in Figures 4 and 5 suggest an intensification of identification with the
                    nation-state over time. Unfortunately, to be able to really assess whether the
                    use of pronouns changes over this period, we would need to be able to determine
                    the exact correlation between noun and pronoun.</div>

                    perfect, which was not true in our case. For the same reason – the lack of
                    semantic information in our corpus (i.e. the guarantee that contiguous words are
                    correctly transcribed in a large proportion of instances) – we were unable to
                    use sentiment mining as a tool in our research, although it would have shed
                    important light on some aspects of the "nationalism" question, such as
                    whether individual newspapers viewed the nation positively or negatively at
                    different points in time. In so far as linguistic changes are signals of wider
                    historical changes, we want to be able to find them on a large scale, but we
                    need this to be theorized by historians as well as by linguists and
                    sociologists. It remains an open question about the potential of such analysis
                    in a collection of nineteenth century newspapers such as we used in our study. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">An important part of the source criticism that we wanted to do for digital searches
                    in our data is to measure or estimate the level of error or uncertainty (and
                    conversely certainty) that accompanies each search. We hardly expect the results
                    to be 100 per cent accurate (given the tendency to false positives as well as
                    false negatives), but some levels of error are acceptable for our research,
                    while others are too high. Not knowing even the order of magnitude is a serious
                    stumbling block [<a class="ref" href="#traubnd">Traub et al., n.d.</a>][<a class="ref" href="#milligan2013">Milligan 2013</a>]. We
                    recognize that errors are generated as much from computational quirks as from
                    digitization, and studying the errors of these methods will undoubtedly benefit
                    from the input of trained statisticians. Until this occurs, it will be difficult
                    to use such tools for anything more than suggestive research.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">The experiments described in this paper focused on finding evidence of
                    nationalism, a complex topic that is common in the professional, historical
                    literature. Our study of newspapers in a small, European country was
                    particularly important because the secondary literature claims that they were
                    very important for spreading nationalism in the late nineteenth century. We
                    first tested whether the nationalist language present in newspapers was more of
                    an emotional or banal sort, thereby testing existing hypotheses about how ideas
                    about national belonging reached the public via newspapers. We used digital
                    methods to interrogate our sources because they allowed us to analyse large
                    corpuses of newspaper articles quickly. What we found—not in elite publications
                    but through a much broader analysis of thousands of newspaper articles and
                    millions of words made possible by digital tools—suggests that the majority of
                    the Dutch population would have been exposed to nationalist thinking through
                    subtle expressions of national belonging rather than emotional rhetoric.
                    Although our findings are not by any means conclusive, they do demonstrate that
                    inferring general views about nationalism from discourse in elite publications
                    is problematic. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Although Michael Billig used a present-day perspective in his book and based his
                    arguments about banal nationalism mostly on sociological literature, we found
                    that his work establishes a useful conceptual framework in which we can
                    understand different forms and expressions of nationalism in the public media.
                    With regard to Dutch nationalism in particular, our findings also support and
                    extend the argument of Van Sas. The problem, as critics of the linguistic turn
                    in history have pointed out, is that observing a change in language in
                    newspapers does not allow us to make a claim about causality or who the actors
                    were who were driving a given process. Indeed, our study indicates that we need
                    to take seriously the possibility that Western Europe’s experience with
                    nationalism in the twentieth-century has caused historians to look for (and
                    highlight) similarly inflamed rhetoric in earlier periods, when such passionate
                    appeals may have been rare rather than representative.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">Through applying digital methods to test a hypothesis found in the historical
                    literature, this paper has contributed to both the study of nationalism and the
                    development of digital methods for concept mining. Although our use of digital
                    methods let us analyse many more sources than is traditional in nationalism
                    studies, thereby enriching the field, we found that major methodological
                    development—not to mention theorisation—is still necessary to apply existing
                    tools to our problem. We found it both necessary and desirable to use smaller
                    corpuses of sources to answer targeted questions, using computers as both search
                    tools and tools of analysis. Using a limited sub-corpus may make it harder to
                    use digital analysis techniques that require training computers using large
                    numbers of documents, but not doing so risks that less popular themes will be
                    drowned out by other discourses. Using a sub-corpus, as others have done [<a class="ref" href="#blaxill2013">Blaxill 2013</a>], also increases a researcher’s ability to describe
                    the corpus and thus to carry out source criticism. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">Unsurprisingly, creating a valid and useful sub-corpus requires composing a good
                    search query. What this is depends on the research question. In this case, in
                    order to study public discourse, we looked for neutral search terms (terms that
                    the literature has concluded were neutral) over the time period that we wanted
                    to study. While we chose terms that would point to events or topics that were
                    publicly visible, thus providing both an opportunity and a reason for public
                    discourse about national identity, we were careful not to choose terms that were
                    themselves charged with meaning or possessed a changing meaning over the time
                    period that we studied. We used multiple methods in order to check the
                    plausibility of results from particular methods. Nevertheless, we found, as
                    others have suggested, that external domain knowledge was indeed crucial in
                    interpreting our results in each step of the process. The desire to use existing
                    digital tools to answer our research question forced us to think about
                    nationalism in many different ways, including especially how it was manifested
                    linguistically, although OCR errors in our nineteenth century newspaper corpus
                    made analytical methods that relied on semantic information inconclusive. We
                    need to be careful, however, because reliance on digital methods can result in
                    elevating certain types of meaning and tests that we as historians are not
                    perhaps competent at using or that we would not otherwise rely on. We found, as
                    others have, that seeking to test existing hypotheses produced interesting leads
                    for further investigation (probably using traditional historical
                    methods—although we did not want to rely on close reading, we did end up close
                    reading some 400 articles to check that our results were not absurd, since the
                    methods that we used are still being developed). </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">With its successes and failures, this project represents an important step
                    towards developing a method to mine public discourse from public media – both
                    the content of and the degree of public support for particular debates over
                    time. We will continue to explore how we can answer questions about identity
                    formation using digital methods to analyse large repositories of historical
                    documents. Developing our ideas further will require developing new, advanced
                    methods for analysis as well as for corpus selection. Yet we have already seen
                    that each and every digital output must be subjected to historical
                    interpretation. Using digital methods is messy, but so is all historical
