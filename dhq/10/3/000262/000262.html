                <p>Digital Humanities provide the means and methods to research topics in a
                    transdisciplinary and multilayered way. In this paper we combine perspectives
                    from historical research and literary criticism to problematize the
                    categorization, computation and representation of events in cultural heritage.
                    Combining methodologies of narratology, historic research and Digital Humanities
                    we aim to extract, classify and quantify events in a way that preserves their
                    inherent multiplicity and multivocality. In two case studies we exemplify that
                    narrative may be seen as a means to mediate events rather than a classical
                    media-centred tradition to preserve an authorized version of cultural
                    heritage.</p>

                    education system of the pre-Second World War period with iconic historical
                    events, including the Battle of Hastings of 14th October 1066, when the Norman
                    army under William I ("The Conqueror") landed close to the modern town of
                    Battle, and defeated the Anglo Saxon army under Harold II. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This view places <em class="emph">the event</em> at the heart of discourse. Many
                    humanities disciplines remain fundamentally concerned with events, their
                    interpretation, and their description. It follows therefore that narrative, as
                    the primary means of making events meaningful, is key to the way in which
                    information becomes knowledge in the humanities; and therefore has a fundamental
                    role to play in the definition of how an "event" should be defined in those
                    domains. Until the emergence of the ubiquitous World Wide Web, most narrative in
                    humanities communication was mounted almost exclusively in text. In this paper,
                    we review recent discussions of how web technologies have changed the way
                    narrative events are formulated, described, connected, received and transmitted
                    in humanities discourse; and explore how an "event" that is
                        "meaningful" from a narrative point of view might be
                    described as structured data, rather than in text. We also consider how this
                    approach might be used to support <em class="emph">multivocal</em> narratives. The study
                    itself is explorative and sometimes even experimental. It thus follows more than
                    one research question. We focus on nevertheless how multiplicity and
                    multivocality in the narration of events is represented in traditional and
                    non-traditional narrative media. Is there a difference in value between the
                    narration of events in textual representations and in other forms of cultural
                    objects, such as monuments and landscapes? We therefore have to ask how events
                    can be made machine readable and how they can be evaluated in terms of
                    narrativity.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">There is a growing recognition that narratives do not have to be
                        "told" in the textual medium, or at least by text alone.
                    A museum exhibition, for example, might present the narrative of how a
                    particular class of object, such as a pottery typology, develops over time and
                    across space, either through emphasising the artefacts as linked entities rather
                    than their physical attributes (upon which conventional approaches to museum
                    display rests) [<a class="ref" href="#cuno2008">Cuno 2008</a>], or through the cultural elaboration of
                    museum spaces themselves. The role of maps as instances of geographic and
                    cartographic narrative has been extensively explored in recent years [<a class="ref" href="#taylor2005">Taylor and Caquard 2005</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#caquard2011">Caquard 2011</a>], as has the curation and presentation of heritage
                    spaces [<a class="ref" href="#azaryahu2008">Azaryahu and Foote 2008</a>]. Archaeological sequences have been
                    explored as narrative memes [<a class="ref" href="#hodder1993">Hodder 1993</a>], as has their
                    interpretation as ways of telling the stories of the past [<a class="ref" href="#pluciennik1999">Pluciennik 1999</a>]. All of these approaches take as their starting
                    point the definition (and distinction) of events, and how they are rendered
                    meaningful through contextualisation with one another. It follows that events
                    can be told through various media in various ways.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">However, one key aspect that they do not address is that of
                        <em class="emph">multiplicity</em> or <em class="emph">multivocality</em>. Each approach, to
                    one degree or another, applies the textual paradigm of the single author, the
                    single narrator, the single point of view -- whether this be the author of an
                    historical treatise; the framer of an archaeological sequence (as reported
                    through the authorship of an archaeological report); the curator of a museum
                    collection; the designer of a museum space, or the designer of the visitor
                    infrastructure of a heritage site. In each case the analogy of multiple
                    authorship can be applied; however, in such cases any joint responsibility for
                    the narrative is funnelled through a single point and platform of authorship:
                    the narrative is "authoritative", produced in a top-down (or
                    rather centre-out) manner, and its coherence relies on these attributes.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In the 1990s to early 2000s, the "operationalisation" of
                    narrative as a process by which events are made readable by machines tended to
                    concentrate on hypertext, and the possibilities for readers to use its
                    affordances to reorganize text according to their own expectations and
                    requirements.The inception of Web 2.0, which can be dated to approximately
                    2007-2009, promised a multivocal platform for narrative expression; and it can
                    be said that the mooted possibilities of hypertext as a vehicle for multiplicity
                    have not been realised (much the same can be said in the present day of blogging
                    and other social media). This is for two reasons: firstly, the use of hypertext
                    to link one part of one document to another still relies on the
                    single-authorship model: one user makes one decision to select one part of one
                    document, and link it to one other. This is closely related to the second
                    reason, namely that since 2007-2009, focus of linking material online has
                    shifted away from the hypertext web to the semantic web. The latter implicitly
                    rejects the notion of multiplicity, and concentrates instead on linkages between
                    monovocal information, structured into data according to predefined schemata.
                    For the study presented here, two approaches to the phenomenon of eventnarration
                    are of particular interest. First, we hypothesize that there can be multiplicity
                    and multivocality even in single-author narration. Second we state that one
                    single event can be narrated in multiple ways.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">By comparing narrative models arising from a) factual and fictional text about
                    crime in twentieth century Hamburg and b) the curated monumental and
                    archaeological space of Hadrian’s Wall, we argue that web-readable data
                    structures gives humanists the means to look beyond text, and the analogies of
                    textual paradigm that are applied to non-textual narrative of the kind described
                    above, to provide multiple insights into events, as well as the process of
                    research itself. Instead of following a single research hypothesis, or a
                        "single authored" narrative, digital narratology can
                    explore multiple research data, told in multiple voices from multiple sources.
                    This reflects the truth that through innovative research settings in
                    collaborative work, re-usability of research data or citizen science projects
                    often come up with more than one possible interpretation.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The possibility of viewing events in cultural heritage as data equating to
                    narrative elements rather than as text opens up the possibility to analyse them
                    from multiple perspectives. However, in past decades, they have often been
                    delivered or distributed in textual form, or as narratives following the
                    traditions and parameters of textual delivery, which means that even though
                    alternative modes of narrative communication, such as oral storytelling, might
                    be an important means of delivery, there are still
                        "authoritative" ways of producing historic narratives,
                    for example, by museum curators. In order to build up databases of narrative
                    events, one possibility is to gather as many texts on them as possible and to
                    extract the most significant events from them in a quantifiable way. As historic
                    events are often represented in different kinds of sources - fictional and
                    factual texts as well as representations in different media, installations in
                    museums or performances - it is helpful to use the term "event" in a
                    transdisciplinary way in order to find an apparatus of tools to extract
                    individual events from those sources, put them into a database, and give them
                    attributes according to narratological traits such as tellability and meaning.
                    This allows us to accommodate multiplicity and multivocality. The term
                        "event" has very specific meanings in narratology and history, and it
                    is to those that we now turn.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The importance of events in narrative studies is undoubted, although there are
                    slightly different definitions of the term in different traditions of analysis.
                    In a broad sense, the term, or similar terms, is used (for example) to explain
                    why people tend to tell stories in general, such as in disciplines like
                    sociological narratology or cognitive narratology; rhetoric and literary
                    criticism events play a central role in theories about storytelling and
                    interpretation techniques as a fundamental part of human meaning making [<a class="ref" href="#ryan2007">Ryan 2007</a>]. However, in linguistic approaches to narrative, the
                    term "event" is more quantitative, referring to the smallest element of
                    stories. Our approach here requires that we encompass both these traditions.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">In rhetoric narratology, the core definition of narrative is "somebody telling somebody else on some occasion and for some purpose(s)
                        that something happened"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#phelan2007">Phelan 2007</a>]. In this definition, the happening or event is the
                    central necessary condition for the rhetorical act. A similar notion of event as
                    the motivation of storytelling can be found in literary studies [<a class="ref" href="#martinez2009">Martinez and Scheffel 2009</a>] and also in anthropological approaches to narrative
                        [<a class="ref" href="#ochs2001">Ochs and Capps 2001</a>]. The ambiguity of the term is stressed not only by
                    the initiation of a story but also the smallest element of action, and thus also
                    of the plot [<a class="ref" href="#martinez2009">Martinez and Scheffel 2009</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#meister2013">Meister 2013</a>]. On one side we thus find a notion of event as
                    being something which is closely linked to the act of storytelling, or more
                    precisely the tellability, or "that which is worth
                        telling" in an event. The more structure-orientated perspective on
                    events starts with the definition of a single event as a change of state. A
                    number of single events is organized according to the parameters of time (such
                    as frequency, duration and order) to build an action. A number of actions is
                    organized to build the plot. In this article we focus on events which are linked
                    to motivation, and thus to the tellability aspect of storytelling. Nevertheless
                    it is important to keep the ambiguity of the term in mind, which has also been
                    the object of important narratological research.</div>

                    defined as change of state. The second is the motivation of the story, and is
                    broadly outlined by describing several conditions that it has to fulfill

                    found to have certain properties, such as having an inherent motivation [<a class="ref" href="#martinez2009">Martinez and Scheffel 2009</a>], being presented in a certain mode of narration

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Following the ideas of relativity and multiplicity developed above, we propose to
                    use the term "eventfulness" in relation to two questions; and thus to
                    explore whether these types of event can be categorised in such a way as to
                    support a multivocal discourse in humanities contexts, while maintaining the
                    attributes of tellability, contestability and reproducibility that are essential
                    to scholarship. First, we ask whether or not a condition of eventfulness is
                    fulfilled, and second, whether it is found to have a lower or higher value of
                    that condition, according to its contextualization. By doing so we open up an
                    interpretive field in which each single event may be analysed according to each
                    of the conditions of eventfulness and tellability, and therefore displaying
                    multiple perspectives on it. An event will thus no longer be a homogeneous unit,
                    but rather a unifying frame of different aspects. Each aspect is given a value
                    from zero (0) to high (3) so that in the end the multiple conditions of
                    eventfulness may be evaluated in numbers which opens up the possibility to
                    compare different events in their factor of eventfulness and tellability. We
                    take it as fact that the terms <em class="emph">event, eventfulness and tellability</em>
                    can be used in a non-literary context. The storyworld referred to above thus
                    becomes either fictional or factual. Further on, we highlight the interpretive
                    character of events and open up the process of deciding whether to evaluate an
                    event in relation to a condition with a lower or higher number. By so doing, we
                    admit that other interpreters or readers might (or might not) end up with other
                    values for a particular event, but nevertheless would probably come to similar
                    conclusions. This approach in itself is shaped by the idea of multiplicity.</div>

                        narratives, this perspective widens it to include oral storytelling. More
                        than in literary criticism (although in literary criticism there are also

                        conversational narratives that a narrative act is produced by the agents of
                        both sender and receiver in a certain context. Furthermore roles and
                        relations of sender and receiver may vary [<a class="ref" href="#ochs2001">Ochs and Capps 2001</a>].

                        storytellers, or bodies, or objects, or texts, meaning that the narrative is
                        detachable from one author or even an authoritative instance. This forces us

                        share common roots, with the two being largely undifferentiated until the

                        literary texts, being factual rather than fictional, it has been stated
                        that, in narratological terms, historical narratives must have a different
                        focalization, because no historically credible "narrator"
                        would have access to the minds of historical characters [<a class="ref" href="#pavel1992">Pavel 1992</a>]. This reflects the criticisms of phenomenological

                        Furthermore, there seems to be no direct need to differentiate between
                        author and narrator in historical texts, and the (general) reader tends to
                        assume that the author-narrator of historical text is reliable [<a class="ref" href="#cohn1989">Cohn 1989</a>]. Despite those distinctions, we take it as fact
                        that there are some similarities in the representation techniques of
                        historic and literary narratives, if only from a purely functional point of
                        view: i.e. both the author of fiction and the historiographer put a number
                        of events into a sequence by building up connections [<a class="ref" href="#lützeler1992">Lützeler 1992</a>], and extrapolate from them a
                            "meaningful" point of view. It is on these aspects of

                        These three variables – name, space, time – might be seen as parts of a

                        explained by the fact that narratology is never really interested in the
                        event itself, but rather tends to focus on the representation or more
                        specifically the telling of it. We are taking two additional factors to our

                        spatial outreach and (10) temporal relations. However, the idea of event as
                        named entity suggests that by focusing on the event as such one can single
                        them out more easily. Afterwards one may turn to more interpretive decisions

                            "real" world or a fictional (story-)world). In both

                        of cultural heritage. As this approach tends to turn events into black boxes
                        excluding their properties and the characteristics of their narration, we

                    selected this case because the factual act of crime is found to have a high
                    eventfulness and follows the additional paradigm of tellability, by virtue of
                    its significance to the community of Hamburg. The texts all deal with the case
                    of Werner Pinzner, who murdered at least five men living and working in the
                    surroundings of the red light district in St. Pauli, Hamburg, an area well known
                    for crime. The case became famous because of two central events: Firstly, this
                    was one of the first acts known or acknowledged to exist in Hamburg, or even in
                    Germany, of organized murder, which is at least partly due to the fact that
                    Pinzer started to talk to the police very openly once he was caught. Secondly,
                    is the fact that he committed an extended suicide killing not only himself, but
                    also his wife and the prosecutor inside the police office during an
                    interrogation. This extended suicide led to several developments in the works
                    and procedures of the police in Hamburg (such as regular screenings of visitors
                    of criminals and other increased security measures). In terms of eventfulness
                    and tellability we argue that the case matches all ten conditions (relevance,
                    unpredictability, irreversibility, non-iterativity, effect, script-violation,
                    personal and interpersonal significance, spatial outreach and temporal
                    relations) to a very high degree. It is therefore not surprising that it was
                    used in factual and fictional narrative representations in different media. </div>

                    the event whereas place and time are less likely to evoke thinking of this
                    specific event immediately. But of course this event is really a series of
                    events. The more concrete an event becomes, the more identifiable will it become
                    by its location and time. So if we take the suicide of Pinzner and the murder of
                    his wife and the prosecutor as one central event of the top-event Pinzner-case,
                    the place will be as concrete as an address with a room number (police office
                    Berliner Tor, Room 418), the exact date will be 29th July 1986. The fact that
                    this specific event has no name as unique identifier brings us back to the more
                    unspecific narrative event. What we can take from the definition of historic
                    events is the possibility of identifying events by a set of surface markers.

                    to our example one will most often not know all of the entities involved. But
                    one can at least be sure that there will be one or more characters, a place and
                    a time attached to an event. So the unique event identifier would be <ul class="list simple"><li class="item">specific character(s) involved + specific place + specific point in

                    providing the possibility to interpret and categorize them according to
                    narratological models. The next step therefore is to identify and collocate the

                    rather a critical mass of events altogether, this fact does not seriously
                    detract from the interpretation and conclusion found here. In the end what we
                    get in this step is a text document enriched by HTML tags highlighting names,
                    places and organizations (this last entity being one excluded from this study). </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">As NER does not include time, we used a second tool called Heideltime to extract
                    temporal data in a similar way. Again, the result is a text document enriched
                    with HTML tags. We stress this point here as it is desirable in Digital
                    Humanities to have cross-tool compatibility in different domains. In this
                    application we normalized our outcome data to create a "real"
                    HTML file. However the next tool we used is CATMA, which satisfies the
                    requirement for cross-domain compatibility by accepting HTML files with
                    intrinsic markup. With CATMA we could do several collocation analyses. Thus, we
                    first looked at all three entities being name, place and time found in a textual
                    surrounding of 20 words. In this analysis CATMA is detecting automatically
                    passages of text in which all three entities are found in proximity to each
                    other and lists all possible variations into a spreadsheet of keywords in
                    context. We repeatedly run queries changing the parameters from all three
                    entities to just two of them and changing pairs. In the end we exported all
                    keyword-in-context-lists to search them manually for the events told in the text
                    and to exclude duplicates. </div>

                    representations the whole process was manually performed when it came to the
                    analysis of the two movies included in the corpus. This means nothing else than
                    noting down each entity named in the movies into a table. "Naming" in this
                    case can be differentiated into being told acoustically or visually which could
                    be either textually or through showing characters or places (we followed Kuhn's
                    attempt [<a class="ref" href="#kuhn2011">Kuhn 2011</a>] to movie narratology here by assuming an
                    audio-visual narrative instance replacing the narrator). Afterwards the lists
                    were again searched manually for events in the surrounding of the named entities
                    characters, place and time. </div>

                    (characters, place, time) leads to the most precise outcome, but unfortunately
                    this approach proved very unsatisfactory regarding recall. On the other side a
                    collocation of two of the variables was not very precise but a lot more events
                    could be found in the outcome data. The automatically produced outcomes were
                    manually analysed and events in the surrounding text passages were identified.
                    Despite the fact that this method is not sufficiently productive to use it on
                    larger corpora it led us to a number of events of different eventfulness and

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">The most important findings for this paper are, firstly, that the six major
                    events (the 5 paid murders and the extended suicide) of the case were narrated
                    through a much larger number of events and, secondly, that these events differ
                    in value of eventfulness. These findings underline the theoretical hypothesis
                    that narrative can be a means to exploit multiplicity and multivocality in
                    events. It is also interesting that in this case study there was neither found
                    an event with no eventfulness at all, nor any kind of
                        "super-event" reaching the highest possible score of
                    eventfulness. The visualization above shows this multiplicity of eventfulness
                    values quite clearly.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">It also shows that there are more events with low eventfulness and that the means
                    of eventfulness is altogether a bit lower in the fictional representation. In
                    addition to that the fictional representation tends to use more eventful events
                    towards the end. On the other side the factual representations shows quite a lot
                    more events on less tokens which means that there is a higher density of events
                    in that text. (However, this finding could also be due to the fact that the tool
                    works better on journalistic texts, so it should not be evaluated too highly.)
                    In both representations one can see that there are passages in the text which
                    show more events than others; one significant finding of such a local event
                    density in both examples being the end, although only the factual representation
                    narrates the historic situation with the extended suicide and murder of the
                    prosecutor (whereas in the novel text, the "St. Pauli Killer"
                    kills himself and his wife in his cell). It is also interesting that both
                    textual representations end with an event of medium eventfulness.</div>

                    main event is told by a number of smaller events of differing eventfulness.
                    Again, the means of the eventfulness values is higher in the factual
                    representation and again the event density is higher in the factual
                    representation showing more events per second than the fictional movie (as in
                    this case the extraction was not done automatically, there is no measuring error
                    to be kept in mind here). The TV movie, though, is the only representation
                    showing a structure which tends to the Aristotelic order of beginning, middle
                    and ending using highly eventful events in these parts of narration. Both films
                    start with a very eventful event "in medias res" which could
                    be interpreted as a typical narrative opening for this medium whereas the texts
                    in this corpus tend to start with rather low-level events. In contrast to the
                    textual representations the filmic narratives both also end with highly eventful
                    events, which might also be medium specific. It is also interesting that the
                    filmic factual representation does not keep one level of eventfulness throughout
                    the whole narration but shows a slight trend to more eventful events towards the
                    end as in the textual representations only the fictional text did. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">In order to get hold of the multivocality of these four texts one has to step
                    back from the data presented above and look into the representations itself. One
                    example which shows this aspect quite well is the spatial narration concerning
                    the street "Reeperbahn", which is where the red light district of Hamburg
                    is situated. Especially in the journalistically written text "Der Lohnkiller" (literally translated "the paid
                        killer"), the "Reeperbahn", is presented as if it was a character of
                    its own having its own will, making its own decisions, and its own narrative.
                    But the spatial narrative of this street is presented in all the texts of the
                    corpus as a collective narrative which many people living in Hamburg and
                    especially in the area around the "Reeperbahn" share and some relate to in
                    a special way, because they take part in it. By doing this they create a
                    collective identity so closely linked to a space that it may seem as if the
                    place was the agent of the narrative, whereas in reality the spatial narrative
                    is a multiplicity of individually experienced events and collectively chosen
                    decisions. What is special about places like this and also about the one
                    presented later on in the second case study of this paper, is that there are
                    different layers of connections to the individually experienced events. The
                    Pinzner case takes the perspective of somebody desperately wanting to take part
                    in the spatial narrative, but never fully getting there, because Pinzner,
                    despite his "job", never really achieved the respect for
                    which he aimed. Further on, the narratives in the corpus also show other
                    characters that take part in the criminal surrounding of the Reeperbahn. The
                    narratives show police, prosecutor and lawyer being inside the spatial narrative
                    and outside of the collective identity of it at the same time. And finally, and
                    no less importantly, the mention of the spatial entities (in addition to
                    Reeperbahn, the area St. Pauli takes a similar role as well as the nickname of
                    it "Kiez") evoke an experience-centred connection to events in the
                    individual memory of the recipient, be it that s/he has heard rumours about it
                    before, visited it before or even takes part in the life-world connected to it. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Despite the fact that the narratives in the corpus represent the event of the
                    Pinzner case in a traditional way using traditional media such as books and
                    movies, they do add multi-perspective and multivocal narratives to the cultural
                    heritage of this specific area of Hamburg. They also add historic events to the
                    experience-based spatial narrative an individual might connect to places like
                    the "Reeperbahn". They even preserve some narratives of places which have
                    vanished from the city today, as the old police headquarters which was situated
                    in the city centre and not as it is now in a highly secured area in the
                    periphery. In the end the events not only structure the narrative, the narrative
                    is also connecting events to other entities (as characters, spaces and dates)
                    and thus adding significance to them. The events vary in eventfulness and
                    tellability as well as in functionality, and thus a narrative multiplicity is
                    not only acknowledged but supported actively. </div>

                    following we now introduce a second case study, which examines Hadrian’s Wall.
                    The Wall is a spatial entity which is less constrained than the Reeperbahn in
                    terms of size as well as in terms of history. From here on we will focus less on
                    traditional representations in modern media and complement the above shown point

                    Another is in the curation and presentation of monuments [<a class="ref" href="#azaryahu2008">Azaryahu and Foote 2008</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#nesbitt2009">Nesbitt and Tolia-Kelly 2009</a>]. This is a particularly interesting environment in
                    which to test the theory of narrative categorisation and non-binary
                    operationalisation, as monuments have multiple "narrators" of
                    their spaces and significance – the designers, the builders, those who occupied
                    the landscape at the time, and those who occupy it now. Hadrian’s Wall is one of
                    the UK’s most iconic ancient monuments. It is a place in its own right, but it
                    is also a place made up of multiple locations (much as the events in Der Fall
                    Pinzner combine to form a larger event), some of which are specific and
                        "tellable", and others more abstract. Its tellable
                    significance derives not only from its size and scale, stretching some 84 miles
                    between the coasts of Northern England, with good preservation of the monument
                    in the middle sections; but also from its context as a key section of the
                    frontier of the Roman Empire from AD 122 until late antiquity. Many writers and
                    observers throughout history have seen it, as a whole, as embodying narratives
                    of separation and division; despite more recent archaeological researches which
                    have stressed its role as a mediator between the (occupying) Roman population in
                    the south and the unoccupied populations to the north [<a class="ref" href="#dobson2000">Dobson and Breeze 2000</a>]. However, as [<a class="ref" href="#hingley2010">Hingley 2010</a>] has demonstrated, the separation
                    narratives persist; in fact one might say they were imposed on the monument
                    after the Roman period by later authors, appearing and reappearing in the
                    writings of multiple witnesses throughout subsequent generations. Following
                    Hingley, one might quote the German historian of the Roman Frontiers, Theodor
                    Mommsen: <blockquote><p>
                        [The German limes] had not, like the Britannic Wall, the
                            object of checking the invasion of the enemy … the Romans in Upper
                            Germany did not confront their neighbours as they confronted the
                            Highlanders of Britain, in whose presence the province was always in a
                            state of siege.

                        "outside", and a concept of
                        "civilisation" and "barbarism", drawn
                    largely from a reading of Classical authors. It reflects the employment of two
                    individuals’ spatial literacy in the understanding of the Wall.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">The concept of spatial literacy is a useful one here, as it implicitly invokes
                    the metaphor of "reading" when it comes to geography, and allows us to
                    develop the concept of the "spatial narrative", in parallel
                    to that of textual narrative. As will be seen, it also supports a similar
                    non-binary operationalisation of events as that demonstrated in Der Fall Pinzer.
                    It also allows us to consider particular embodied interactions with the Wall in
                    terms of their "eventfulness" and
                        "tellability", in much the same ways as the Hamburg
                    sequence above is composed of "eventful" and
                        "tellable" happenings at different scales. The idea of
                    the spatial narrative has been theorised in recent years by scholars such as
                    Bodenhamer, Corrigan and Harris [<a class="ref" href="#bodenhamer2010">Bodenhamer et al. 2010</a>], and in relation
                    to the curation of heritage sites by [<a class="ref" href="#azaryahu2008">Azaryahu and Foote 2008</a>]. For the
                    present purposes, it may be most usefully defined as "a
                        meaningful statement, or set of linked statements, whose fundamental
                        structure is geographical", where each statement tells an event. Or,
                    to put it in the context of the poststructuralist theory of narrative developed
                    above, a narrative is a "spatial" one when its
                        "eventfulness" and "tellability" stem
                    from the description of events which happen in, and relate to, a location, which
                    is specifiable to a greater or lesser degree. The statement may stem from
                    experience, proximity, association, or some extrinsic geographical (or
                    archaeological) feature. "Reading" such a narrative is the
                    making of personal meaning as "told" by the place, as opposed
                    from a narrative that is told by another human agent. In this case,
                        "the other" is not a human narrator or agent, but the
                    Wall itself. It follows logically that a spatial narrative cannot be read in any
                    light other than that of multiplicity. The more points that are added in terms
                    of time, character and (smaller) places, the definition of the event becomes
                    clearer.</div>

                    Birdoswald, in Cumbria. This, fort number 11 in the official English Heritage
                    listing, was not described in Camden’s Britannia, although Camden himself was
                    clearly aware of it, as John Warburton, in his 1778 treatise on Hadrian’s Wall,
                    noted that Camden had mistakenly believed the fort to have been situated at the
                    nearby town of Willowford [<a class="ref" href="#warburton1753">Warburton 1753</a>]. Our narrative begins
                    with the establishment of the fort, which is connected by the Wall to milecastle
                    49 and, further on, to the extant Wall structure to the east of the river at
                    Willowford. Approximately 800 meters to the east of the present-day course of
                    the river is a bridgehead of Roman date, indicating that the course of the river

                    invoked to support the narrative of separation. On the other hand, as Nesbitt
                    and Tolia-Kelly note, the embodied experience of the Wall, and of its
                    constituent forts, is conditioned by English Heritage curation, and this is
                    expressible through the individual embodied experiences of those who visit or
                    interact with the section, at any point in its history [<a class="ref" href="#nesbitt2009">Nesbitt and Tolia-Kelly 2009</a>]. In the context of the present day, its impact on
                    visitors, as recorded by how they move along and through the monument, can be
                    rendered visually in GPS traces uploaded to OpenStreetMap, the Open Source
                    online mapping platform. Here, people have the opportunity to capture the
                    pathways they take using their mobile devices, and share them on the map
                    platform. They are thus adding specific and individual narrative events to
                    abstract spatial narrative of the Wall as a whole. The traces shown in <span class="error"><a href="#figure03">Figure 3</a></span> indicate little or no engagement with the
                    Wall or the trail, rather they all lead from the nearby car park. Once at the
                    site, the highly conditioned nature of the experience, and thus of the
                    narrative, become apparent: most of the visitors’ movements are confined to the
                    north of the fort, with much less movement in the south. Most of the embodied
                    engagement is therefore with the visitors’ centre and shop, and prior to that
                    the car park. One can also detect that some visitors moved a few meters to the
                    north, perhaps for the purposes of getting a longer view of the site. <div id="figure04" class="figure">

                    single authored narrative there may be a multiple and multivocal set of events
                    which tell the story altogether, in this case study we went the other way around
                    and chose some events connected to the Birdoswald Fort in order to compare them
                    by eventfulness and tellability. First of all we have to clarify that these
                    events are historic events rather than narrative events because they are not
                    necessarily narrated. In opposition to the events of the first case study, they
                    may be seen as raw events and yet it has been proven possible to evaluate them
                    with narratological categories.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p54">Contrary to the events that constructed the narratives about Pinzner, these
                    events are relatively in the value of eventfulness/tellability despite the fact
                    that they are very heterogeneous when it comes to their historic time, or their
                    status as events that are "told" by official or unofficial
                    sources. What is striking about the events when represented in this way is that
                    individual visits of the wall have a slightly higher eventfulness/tellability
                    than most of the officially delivered events: <div id="figure06" class="figure">

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55">Overall, this suggests that where spatial entity, such as Hadrian’s Wall, is the
                    dominant feature in its landscape, it normalises the narrative complexity of
                    events which are connected with it. The eventfulness and tellability might vary
                    with the kind of event, and the "official" or
                        "unofficial" nature of the narrator, but essentially they
                    share the fact that they are all differing interpretations of a common dominant
                    feature. This is in contrast to an area such as the Reeperbahn, which contains
                    and informs, but does not dominate, the narrative of the Pinzer events.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p56">This analysis has shown that representations of events in traditional media are
                    not as unilinear and univocal as they first appear, and that representing
                    subjective instances of them in a machine-readable way is potentially possible.
                    Secondly we can state that individually experienced, or
                        "instanced" events, to use the terminology of [<a class="ref" href="#mostern2008">Mostern and Johnson 2008</a>], events are of equal value as culturally delivered
                    events. This comparative analysis across a specific narrative in Hamburg, and an
                    abstract one in Northern England, shows events can be conceived in a
                    gazetteer-like way, without the reductionist limitations that a gazetteer based
                    purely on Cartesian space contains.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p57">57</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p57">In terms of methods we have demonstrated that an approach to events which
                    included multiple factors of eventfulness and tellability is fruitful for the
                    analysis of single events in the context of all the others, and may bring us
                    closer to the materiality of humanities discourse as evidence-based
                    storytelling. It has also been shown that narrated or mediated events and
                    historic events may be analysed with the same parameters (if these include the
                    ideas of multiplicity and multivocality). The structured data we processed in
                    our case studies showed that the storage of events in a database gives us the
                    possibility to evaluate those, along different parameters derived from
                    narratological theory.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">The DH workflow including several tools was fruitful but nevertheless found to be
                    inconvenient for studies focusing on larger corpora. In terms of finding
                    effective ways of automated event extraction this attempt therefore must be seen
                    more or less as failed. Nevertheless the basic ideas of quantification and
                    (semi-) automated extraction of data taken from Digital Humanities research led
                    to first insights into general narrative techniques related to the
                    representation of events. Aspects of storyline and event density could be
                    discussed and related to different narrative genres. These very first hints on
                    technical aspects of storytelling could lead to further (DH) research on plot
                    structures combining the computational with the narratological perspective. </div>
