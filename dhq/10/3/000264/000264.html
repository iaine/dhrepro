                <p>These days, we are constantly looking for an image of ourselves in the historical
                    past. “The first ever information revolution,” begins a typical book jacket
                    blurb, “began with the advent of the printed book, enabling Renaissance scholars
                    to formulate new ways of organizing and disseminating knowledge” [<a class="ref" href="#sawday2000">Sawday and Rhodes 2000</a>]. A communications scholar offers a view of our place
                    in history that has echoes in countless other publications and presentations:
                    “At present we are witnessing an information revolution whose significance
                    parallels and perhaps even surpasses that of the information revolution caused
                    by the printing press in the fifteenth century” [<a class="ref" href="#jucker2003">Jucker 2003</a>, 129]. Publishers, both academic and trade, have created a new genre
                    of book titles that confidently find the digital sizzle in the analog past:
                        <cite class="title italic">The Renaissance Computer</cite> (on printed books),
                        <cite class="title italic">The Victorian Internet</cite> (on the telegraph),
                        <cite class="title italic">Social Media: The First 2,000 Years</cite> (on
                    letters, pamphlets, and graffiti). Scholars give talks with titles like "Books as Social Media" (Leah Price), "Blogging Now and Then (250 Years Ago)" (Robert
                    Darnton), and "What’s in a Visitor’s Book? Social Media and
                        Volcanic Tourism in the Nineteenth Century" (John Brewer).</p>
                <p>Surrounded as we are by these analogies—by these claims in favor of specific ways
                    of construing the relationship between the past and the present, and by the
                    significance claims that go with them—it seems fair to ask what purposes they
                    serve. There is no doubt that we feel ourselves to be in the midst of a period
                    of dramatic change in our media and information environments. My interest in
                    this essay lies not in these environments themselves, but rather in our popular
                    uses of historical metaphor to explain them. Why, in particular, do we turn to
                    the rise of the printing press, out of all the options available, as our
                    standard analogy for the rise of the internet? What value does this metaphor
                    hold for us, what does it enable and what does it constrain, and what value does
                    metaphoric thinking in general hold for analysis in media studies? It is as
                    common for us today to use the printing press as a unit of measure in
                    estimations of information history as it is for us to discuss our current
                    circumstances in terms of an <em class="term">information revolution.</em> But how
                    historically accurate are these kinds of description? What do they mean for the
                    ways in which we as futurists make use of history—and what do they mean for the
                    ways in which we as historians take the long view? </p>

                    dramatic change in our media and information environments. My interest in this
                    essay, however, lies not in these environments themselves, but rather in our
                    popular uses of historical metaphor to explain them. Specifically, my interest
                    lies in the practical and theoretical functions that historical metaphor serves
                    in the intellectual marketplace. It is as common today for us to use the
                    printing press as the central unit of measure in estimations of information
                    history as it is for us to discuss our current circumstances in terms of an
                        <em class="term">information revolution.</em> Surrounded as we are by these
                    analogies—by these claims in favor of specific ways of construing the
                    relationship between the past and the present, and by the significance claims
                    that go with them—it seems fair to ask what purposes they serve. Situating an
                    examination of this rhetoric within a larger discussion of the market forces
                    that affect rhetorical practice, I seek to delimit a context for the emergence
                    of a distinctive set of contemporary tropes. What do these kinds of historical
                    analogy mean for the ways in which we make use of history, and what do they mean
                    for the ways in which we as historians take the long view? Why, in particular,
                    do we turn to the rise of the printing press as our standard analogy for the
                    rise of the internet? What meanings does this metaphor constrain, what values
                    does it offer to overwhelm those constraints, and what value does metaphoric
                    thinking in general hold for analysis in media studies? </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">As I will show, this rhetoric offers a powerful reminder of the extent to which
                    technological discourse—inside as well as outside the academy—is obliged to
                    respond to market imperatives. The tropes that join Zuckerberg with Gutenberg
                    sell; thus they feature in the titles, cover blurbs, journalistic ledes, and
                    other peripheral elements of texts that do not advance the arguments they imply.
                    Objections to the revolutionary myths of technological history—for example, that
                    digital practice has failed to supplant the paper world or that computers
                    possess no single or unified history—risk retreating from figure to ground when
                    these elements are in play. Indeed, this set of tropes participates in a longer
                    history of technological rhetoric that utilizes slippery language to shape the
                    story of technological change in a form with popular appeal, a rhetoric that, as
                    Leo Marx has noted, includes our uses of the word <em class="term">technology</em>
                    itself.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The analogy that joins “our time” with that of Johann Gutenberg precedes the
                    internet age, reaching back at least to the works of Marshall McLuhan in the
                    1960s and 1970s (especially his 1962 blockbuster, <cite class="title italic">The
                        Gutenberg Galaxy</cite>) and Walter Ong in the 1980s. McLuhan and Ong
                    heralded an electronic age that seemed poised to return society, albeit somewhat
                    differently configured, to the forms of orality that predated the era of print.
                    For them, a medium was not only a vehicle of expression, but an almost
                    inevitable logic that could shape entire social constellations and forms of
                    being. For example, while the logics that govern print culture include fixity,
                    systematization, and multiplicity, oral culture—both in its "primary"
                    (pre-print) and "secondary" (post-print) configurations—operates by logics
                    of fluidity, instability, and collective composition [<a class="ref" href="#kernan1987">Kernan 1987</a>, 54].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In 2007, the Danish scholar Lars Ole Sauerberg gave new life to this view of
                    media history by introducing the concept of a <em class="term">Gutenberg
                        Parenthesis,</em> a historical model that Thomas Pettitt has done much to
                    popularize [<a class="ref" href="#pettitt2007">Pettit 2007</a>] This model frames the <em class="term">culture of
                        print</em> that came in the wake of the printing press as a temporary
                    interlude rather than a permanent structural change: "a mere parenthesis between the oral world of almost all
                            of history prior to the invention of the printing press and the
                            secondary orality that we are experiencing as from the invention of the
                            Internet"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#cordongarcia2013">Cordon-Garcia et al., 2013</a>]. The Gutenberg Parenthesis model seeks to unseat print culture from the
                    throne of modernity and progress, suggesting instead that print culture, despite
                    its apparent triumph over history, is in fact a temporary anomaly, with the
                    prevailing order of human communication remaining on the side of speech and
                    immediacy [<a class="ref" href="#ong2005">Ong 2005</a>, 207]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">For scholars working within a modern liberal framework, the appeal of this model
                    is multidimensional. For one, the figure of the Gutenberg Parenthesis represents
                    an effort to make media history less triumphalist. From the perspective of
                    cultural pluralism, a valuable function of this historical model is that it
                    presents the historical development of technology as an uneven pattern of
                    recursion, restoration, and repetition, and thus allows the subject of literacy
                    and orality to be pursued in the era of the internet without reducing it to an
                    argument about the civilized and the non-civilized. The printing press stands as

                    that a look backward from the rise of print and print literacy can show us the
                    same primordial soup that produced digital social media. We should celebrate,

                    the past focus far less on understanding the past than on understanding the
                    future. The use of popular terms like <em class="term">social media</em> when discussing
                    18th- and 19th-century visitors’ albums and commonplace books promises that we
                    can identify the seeds of the future in the present by discovering our
                    doppelgängers on the other side of a brief swerve in history. In both academic
                    literature and the trade press, it has been a popular argument in recent years
                    that the apparent endings we are witnessing in our own time—the end of privacy,
                    the end of mass media, the end of the book—represent simply a return to the
                    past, to a historical norm of greater stability and longer duration. The end of
                    the printed book means the close of a Gutenberg parenthesis between manuscript
                    networks and e-mail networks; the end of privacy is the close of a privacy
                    parenthesis between the intrusiveness of the village well and the casual
                    intrusiveness of Facebook stalking; the end of mass media is simply the end of a
                    brief interlude in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, supported by the
                    economics of advanced industrial society, in which gathering and disseminating
                    high-quality news was an easier and cheaper task for huge enterprises than for
                    lay citizens [<a class="ref" href="#pettitt2013">Pettit</a>]. Yet past and present have never
                    joined up quite so easily. This approach to modeling history, although there is
                    something admirable in its presentation of an alternative to the literature of
                    elegy and nostalgia that has accompanied the "rise" of the digital age,
                    itself succumbs to a false nostalgia, and a false parallelism, in the suggestion
                    that a return to the past can heal a division that would otherwise be a wound.
                    Any return to ways of being that can be identified as "past" must be a
                    return with a substantial difference. Surely a lack of privacy in the village or
                    the clan, when intimacy was intimacy with several hundred people, was a
                    significantly different experience from a lack of privacy in a networked world

                    to views of media change in terms of internal logic or seismic rupture. These
                    scholars argue that media change is gradual, iterative, and occurs in reciprocal

                    can move in any number of directions; in time, it settles down in a single
                    direction, which then comes to seem natural and inevitable. Early witnesses of
                    the rise of television failed to perceive many of the directions it might have
                    taken, including a superior visual picture, in part because its definition as a

                    users of domestic television sets settled for an inferior standard of visual
                    quality because of the social system that surrounded television broadcasting.
                    Williams writes, "[T]here were, in the abstract, several different ways

                            research and development, the domestic television set is in a number of
                            ways an inefficient medium of visual broadcasting"

                    the way the misleading term <em class="term">mass communication</em> did (if Williams is
                    right) in the early years of television, obscuring a more plural and pregnant
                    reality. For Warner, this includes the reality that differing media systems
                    always coexist, few ever becoming in a real sense obsolete, and all of them
                    constantly renewing themselves in response to one another [<a class="ref" href="#warner1990">Warner 1990</a>].</div>

                    In practice, the uses of these analogies draw upon their ability to tacitly
                    present technology as an autonomous force that operates according to its own
                    logic and in dramatic leaps. That media change occurs in seismic shifts, or that
                    it occurs due to the autonomous "logic" of new technologies, are not widely
                    held ideas in media studies, but nonetheless they form the core of some of the
                    most widely used <em class="emph">narratives</em> in media studies. In this view, the
                    printing press is a ubiquitous analogy for the computer in part because it
                    readily summons narratives of seismic innovation. Even the language of
                        "obsolete" technology and "new" media reaffirms these buried
                    metaphors on a smaller scale. As I will discuss, the popularity of these
                    metaphors may best be attributed to marketplace pressures in Silicon Valley and
                    the academic marketplace of ideas. While we normally imagine debate in terms of
                    challengers vying for dominance in the marketplace, there are times when the
                    presence of a marketplace itself acts as a dominating force, and this is true,
                    albeit in different ways, in industry and the university alike.</div>

                        "hazardous" concept, used largely as a placeholder to fill a void
                    between the artifacts we create and the kinds of social change we want to

                    Marx has identified for the concept of <em class="term">technology</em>. The effort to
                    find the key term or analogy to label our own time belongs to a predictive
                    impulse: an assumption, often buried but still forceful, that technological
                    culture develops according to an autonomous force and essence, and that by
                    identifying this essence we can gain a privileged vantage point onto the future. </div>

                    the needs of the moment. It better served an emerging system of belief about
                    history and progress than prior terms for the same general concept, such as

                        arts</em>. This system of belief included, first, the joining of an
                    earlier Enlightenment belief in historical progress (i.e. a view of history as a
                    force moving toward more advanced and enlightened stages of civilization) with a
                    newer belief that scientific and mechanical innovation were responsible for,
                    indeed constituted, this movement. The Enlightenment conception of history, as
                    Kant articulated it, assumed, first, that history has a forward impulse and a
                    destination, and second, that this destination consists of political progress,
                    which improvements in the mechanical arts might help (but only help) to bring
                    about. In the early nineteenth century, people began to speak as though
                    improvements in the mechanic arts were themselves the goal toward which history
                    moves, and thus constitute what people continued to call
                        "progress". This conceptual shift entailed a new
                    treatment of history as the story of man’s intellectual conquest of nature.
                    Together, Marx argues, these ideological changes "created a semantic void, that is, a set of social
                            circumstances for which no adequate concept was yet available—a void
                            that the new concept, <em class="term">technology</em>, eventually would

                        component</em> in relation to the whole sharpened the need for a term that
                    could refer to a complex system while seeming to refer to a specific instrument.
                    Further, in keeping with the conceptual shift toward a sense that industrial
                    change is a goal in its own right, this semantic need entailed a meaning that
                    would encompass not only an instrument in the service of progress, but also the
                    fact of progress itself [<a class="ref" href="#marx2000">Marx 2000</a>, 36]. The term
                        <em class="term">technology</em> emerged to fill that need. Thus we can say today
                    that automotive technology (for example) permeates the world in the form of
                    cars, trucks, roads and highway infrastructure, the shipping and delivery
                    industries, industries for materials such as steel and glass, through to the
                    abstract benefits of living in an automotive society. Computer technology is
                    likewise omnipresent, from tablets, phones, and PCs through to children’s toys,
                    washing machines, sewage systems, power plants, and, of course, automotive
                    technology [<a class="ref" href="#marx2000">Marx 2000</a>, 38]. The value of the term
                        <em class="term">technology</em> lies in its very ambiguity. As Marx writes elsewhere
                    in reference to the concept of <em class="term">the machine</em>: "The whole issue becomes irrelevant once we recognize
                            that we are dealing with a metaphor, and that its immense appeal rests,
                            not on its capacity to describe the actual character of
                            industrialization, but rather on its vivid suggestiveness. It evokes the
                            uniqueness of a new way of life, as experienced, and, most important, it
                            is a vivid expression of the affinity between technology and the great
                            political revolution of modern times."

                    material artifact that readily elides into a much larger social, organizational,
                    and mechanical system, the scope of which is vast and indeterminate. The view of
                    the effects of the printing press that Walter Ong promoted (that the transition
                    from <em class="term">oral culture</em> to <em class="term">literate culture,</em> along with the
                    changes this implies in terms of education, cultural production, trade, and so

                    eventually succeeded him (that these changes were slow and gradual) both
                    participate in the post-industrial rhetoric that elides a single artifact with
                    an unknowably large system. In short, the metaphor of the printing press serves
                    in our discourse much the same role that Marx has identified for the concept of
                        <em class="term">technology.</em> The trope is useful precisely because our
                    understanding of its boundaries is so nebulous that we can apply the trope
                    without having to commit to any specific point of reference. </div>

                    when we use it in reference to periods before the quite recent past. In a
                    lecture at Harvard in 2014, he stressed the changes in meaning that the term has
                    undergone throughout the history of its usage. Until the mid-nineteenth century,
                    the word <em class="term">information</em> was a transferred use of the verb <em class="emph">to
                        inform</em>, rather in the way that <em class="emph">delineation</em> is a
                    transferred use of the verb <em class="emph">to delineate</em>. For much of the twentieth
                    century, the term vacillated between vague meanings in popular usage and quite
                    different specific meanings in specialist terminology. <a class="noteRef" href="#d4639e610">[4]</a> Duguid argues that we have come more recently to use the word
                        <em class="term">information</em> as a placeholder, a catchall term for phenomena we
                    do not know how to identify or describe [<a class="ref" href="#duguid2014">Duguid 2014</a>]. </div>

                    information culture, we succumb to anachronism twice. First, this metaphorical
                    use relies on a now-belated concept, dating to the aftermath of the Industrial
                    Revolution, of a single artifact that can represent a wider matrix of political,
                    social, cultural, and institutional effects while diffusing specific claims
                    about what those effects might be. Our understanding of the effects of the
                    printing press is so multifarious that we can, and generally do, apply the
                    figure as a placeholder for the unknown. By comparing changes in our information
                    culture to changes that the printing press "created" in an earlier
                    information culture, we open our claim to include a wide range of possible
                    meanings, but in the process we drain the comparison of specific value. Second,
                    and more importantly, by unreflectively using the printing press as a metaphor
                    for changes in an information culture, we elide long-term shifts in ideology and
                    material practice that may represent the most important forms of difference

                    present, by contrast with public narratives of revolution and upheaval, a

                    technology—the phase during which only one or a few companies can benefit from

                    which everyone uses and which therefore confers no comparative advantage.
                    Technology firms that rely on venture-capital funding and the sale of stock
                    options therefore have a substantial incentive to behave as though they are
                    perpetually in the proprietary cycle. Their rhetoric reflects this fact. But
                    such rhetoric is highly misleading, he argues; most computing technologies

                    more available to academic discourse considered as a marketplace. It is
                    reasonable to acknowledge that communication has played a large role in the
                    history of computing; digital computers rely on symbol processing, for example,
                    and the most high-profile operations of modern computers involve
                        communication.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4639e768">[6]</a> Yet it is also reasonable to
                    acknowledge that the history of computers includes many genealogies besides the
                    one that runs through the history of communication.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4639e771">[7]</a> From the perspective of
                    humanities discourse, the most obvious benefit of framing the computer as a
                    communications instrument <em class="emph">to the exclusion of all else</em> is that it
                    translates all that computers produce into communication. If everything is
                    discourse, then everything can be analyzed discursively. In critical discourse,
                    the printing press metaphor enables us to evoke a sense of forward movement and
                    developmental logic that enhances the significance and narrative coherence of
                    the histories we tell. We can also see elements of such an agenda in the buried
                    metaphors that pervade narratives of media and literary history, such as the
                        <em class="emph">rise</em> of print and the <em class="emph">rise</em> of the book. In short,
                    although neither the academy nor Silicon Valley think of the computer as only a
                    communications instrument, both recognize benefits in linking computers to a
                    communications-based genealogy. Even when they acknowledge the diversity of the
                    forms and functions of computing technology, media theorists often find
                    themselves obliged to narrow those functions for the sake of a narrative they
                    can claim as their own. </div>

                    Bourdieu. I invoke him in this essay simply to indicate that the problem is not
                    new, even if it is distinctively of our own time. He describes its operations in
                    several places, but especially in the essay <cite class="title italic">“Flaubert and
                        the French Literary Field,</cite> where he classifies cultural producers

                    [<a class="ref" href="#bourdieu1993b">Bourdieu 1993b</a>, 145–211]. As producers of ideology, these
                    figures hold positions of dominance within a culture’s general field of power;
                    but they are themselves dominated by the need for their ideas to succeed within
                    a marketplace, and in that sense they resemble, if perhaps are not one with, the
                    dominated [<a class="ref" href="#bourdieu1993a">Bourdieu 1993a</a>, 172]. Bourdieu writes of the
                    conditions that produce these figures: <blockquote><p>[T]he literary
                            and artistic field is contained within the field of power, while
                            possessing a relative autonomy with respect to it, especially as regards
                            its economic and political principles of hierarchization. It occupies a

                            field, which is itself situated at the dominant pole of the field of
                            class relations. It is thus the site of a double hierarchy: the
                                <em class="emph">heteronomous</em> principle of hierarchization, which would
                            reign unchallenged if, losing all autonomy, the literary and artistic
                            field were to disappear as such (so that writers and artists became
                            subject to the ordinary laws prevailing in the field of power, and more
                            generally in the economic field), is <em class="emph">success</em>, as measured
                            by indices such as book sales, number of theatrical performances, etc.,

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">In Bourdieu’s analysis, in a capitalist society, those who hold economic capital
                    enjoy positions of dominance in the field of power, while those who hold
                    cultural capital find themselves in an ambiguous position of gilded
                    subordination: they help to articulate the values and ideas of their time, and
                    they often find themselves under pressure to legitimate existing power
                    structures, but they can also criticize those structures and disseminate
                    subversive views. The scholars and critics who discuss technology in the
                    marketplace of ideas, as well as the tech companies that seek to stand out in
                    the crowded attention economy of Silicon Valley, represent distinctively
                    twenty-first century versions of this concept. While in theory and indeed in
                    practice they subscribe to the idea that technological change is gradual and
                    iterative, they regularly invoke the spirit of revolutionary technology because
                    it attracts attention and creates valuable claims for the authority and
                    significance of their work. Although they hold a dominant position in the
                    culture, they are dominated by the marketplace, which is the true form of

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">By way of a coda, I would like to draw attention to some of the implications of
                    this line of discussion for our understanding of the literary ecosystem
                    surrounding the young discipline of the digital humanities. Proponents of this
                    discipline, such as Lev Manovich, have occasionally drawn criticism for making
                    excessively revolutionary claims about the applications of computing technology
                    in humanistic studies. Such criticism ignores the fact that this kind of
                    rhetoric is consciously designed to operate within an attention economy that
                    rewards revolutionary claims about technology; that it represents, in part, the
                    most practical of objectives: to obtain support and set provisional boundaries
                    for the discipline. As a consequence, critics cannot properly engage with the
                    claims that it marshals unless they take these objectives into account. We
                    should be able to acknowledge that this kind of rhetoric is, to a certain
                    degree, strategizing, given that we are implicated in this kind of strategizing
                    ourselves. Otherwise we all risk talking past one another. In other words, what
                    is at stake in the effort to properly classify the role of revolutionary
                    rhetoric in digital humanities literature is the ability for the discipline’s
                    proponents and critics to meet on a common ground of understanding—which in this
                    case requires us to acknowledge openly the normally implicit and unacknowledged
                    fact that academic discourse is shaped by its presence in a marketplace.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">Have digital technologies changed much of the surface character of our practice?
                    Reasonable people can disagree. Robert Gordon makes the similarity of our online
                    activities to our offline activities a key component of his proposed solution to
                    the Solow computer paradox, which observes that the omnipresence of computers
                    does not appear to have driven up productivity [<a class="ref" href="#gordon2004">Gordon 2004</a>]. Yet
                    even if digital practice to a large extent recapitulates what we were doing
                    before, this is not a persuasive reason for us to ignore the fact that our
                    practice is digital. In recent years, articles in publications ranging from
                        <cite class="title italic">The Los Angeles Review of Books</cite> to <cite class="title italic">The New York Times</cite> have taken issue with the digital
                    humanities as a discipline on the grounds that computers are less <cite class="title italic">revolutionary</cite> than we pretend they are. Writing for
                    the <cite class="title italic">New Republic</cite>, Adam Kirsch asks why we cannot
                    simply proceed as before with the new tools: "Was it necessary for a humanist in the past five
                            hundred years to know how to set type and publish a book? Moreover, is
                            it practical for a humanities curriculum that can already stretch for
                            ten years or more, from freshman year to Ph.D., to be expanded to
                            include programming skills?"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#kirsch2014">Kirsch 2014</a>]. Of course, one objection to this kind of comment is simply that
                    scholarship focused on digital practice represents a natural extension of
                    previous critical approaches in the humanities. Since the 1980s, for example,
                    Anglo-American textual scholarship has placed great emphasis on the fact that
                    authors once worked within a literary system that entailed setting type and
                    publishing books; naturally these scholars, and the scholars they train, would
                    take interest in programming and markup. But Kirsch’s question can be addressed.
                    While we may be doing much of the same humanistic work online—curating
                    exhibitions, creating films, staging performances, writing and publishing books,
                    teaching courses—that does not mean that the work of humanism will go on
                    unaffected by digital technologies.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Some percentage of undergraduates who choose to major in the humanities—I would
                    guess a large percentage—do so in the hope of working in a humanities field
                    later on, and further a humanities field outside the academy. Many think,
                        "This is my kind of field. I think I’ll go into publishing,
                        editing, something in the book business, and become a person of
                        letters." But the book business is not what it was even ten years
                    ago. For example, these days, it is common to see internship and job openings at
                    news organs, some of them old and staid, some of them as new as tomorrow’s viral
                    video—the <cite class="title italic">Harvard Business Review</cite>, the <cite class="title italic">Boston Globe</cite>, New York University’s <cite class="title italic">GovLab</cite>, Buzzfeed—that ask for students who know how to
                    clean, scrape, and otherwise work with data. They sometimes make explicit that
                    they will take someone who can work with data and teach them to write stories in
                    preference to taking someone who knows how to write stories and teaching them to
                    work with data. In a recent job announcement, Buzzfeed asked that candidates,
                        "Have a track record of using data to find, tell, and
                        reinforce powerful stories. Qualifying work isn’t limited to journalism; it
                        could include investigations within academia, law enforcement, business,
                        government, and other non-newsroom environments." In short, it seems
                    increasingly clear that the future of letters, including the future of the roles
                    that various agents play out in the world of letters, requires skill sets that
                    belong to the digital world. If the promises that we make in humanities courses
                    include, implicitly, that the students will eventually be able to work in
                    humanities fields, then these promises should be fulfilled by a humanities
                    education. </div>
