                <p>In this paper we introduce the syntagm "pragmatic modelling"
                    as a productive way of contextualising research in Digital Humanities (DH). We
                    define "pragmatic modelling" as a middle-out approach
                    (neither top down nor bottom up) that combines formal and experimental modelling
                    techniques with an effective use of language. Furthermore, in order to elucidate
                    a "pragmatic understanding" of model building, we reflect on
                    texts (considered here as objects) and modelling (or strategy of analysis) in DH
                    research (and teaching). This paper does not identify a new practice or
                    approach; rather it offers an explanatory framework for existing practices. As
                    the paper explains, this framework goes beyond existing ones and allows us to
                    think about modelling in a more integral way. Drawing on this framework, we
                    reveal how DH modelling practices challenge epistemological and linguistic
                    restrictions, by, for example, problematising the adoption of terminology
                    belonging to the domain of computer sciences. Reflections on metaphorical
                    reasoning are used to exemplify how polarities and some rigidities DH research
                    could find itself embedded in are overcome in practice. We conclude by
                    advocating the importance of a diachronic and historical analysis of the role of
                    metaphors in DH to further explore the relation between theory and practice as
                    well as to develop models of modelling integral to DH research.</p>

                    namely interdisciplinarity, is possible [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2016">McCarty 2016</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#marras2012">Marras 2012</a>]. DH scholars and professionals are making use of a
                        "blended" style reflected both in their language, by
                    adopting expressions to account for new scenarios, and in their research and
                    teaching approaches, often integrating computational methods and terminologies
                    with modes of <em class="emph">discourse</em> associated with more established
                    scholarship in the humanities [<a class="ref" href="#marras2013">Marras 2013</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2009">Flanders 2009</a>]. DH is surely a field in rapid evolution, where
                    open questions are numerous and self-reflexivity is not new (see for example
                        [<a class="ref" href="#gold2012">Gold 2012</a>]). Modelling is widely agreed to be a central
                    activity of DH; as the discipline is institutionalised to a greater degree, new
                    opportunities and challenges are being opened up, not least to understand the
                    act of modelling far better than we have done in the past. In particular, the
                    sharing of empirical practices and methodologies across borders makes DH
                    somewhat comparable to the techno-sciences;<a class="noteRef" href="#d17382e221">[1]</a> it also anchors humanities scholarship to a practical
                    dimension that renews its 15th-century roots of empirical <span class="foreign i">studia humanitatis</span>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d17382e235">[2]</a> This paper will make a contribution to this discussion by
                    asking the following questions: other scholarship in the humanities and
                    techno-sciences has passed/passes via the experimental and the formal; in what
                    way is the experimental and the formal done in DH different and similar? Where
                    do DH modellers position their models in the polarity between texts/objects and
                    theory/practice? Is modelling in computing going to lift our way of seeing, and
                    therefore thinking, to another level of analysis? </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">To address these questions our argument will engage with two interrelated

                    sciences and therefore in mathematical reasoning. It is also directly
                    interconnected with work on texts [<a class="ref" href="#buzzetti2002">Buzzetti 2002</a>], the privileged

                    of our argument is that in describing their modelling activities DH researchers
                    tend to privilege a symbolic analysis of texts instead of a pragmatic one. The
                    former view on text focuses on partitioning it into descriptive chunks or
                    components, be they material or conceptual, while the latter, as we intend it
                    here, calls for an integrative approach where the <em class="emph">use</em> of language

                            "Pragmatics". We aim to highlight how that
                        aspect of pragmatic modelling might need further attention in a DH context
                        with respect to the two following elements: flexibility of language and
                        fuzzy polarities (in particular object vs. model). By using the term
                        pragmatic modelling we intend to emphasise an understanding of the act of
                        modelling as anchored to theory and language. Kralemann and Lattmann explain
                            "the semiotic structure of the model
                            relation" as following: <blockquote><p>

                                pragmatics), a subject chooses a set of objects Oi=1,...,n (i.e. the
                                extension of the model) and a theory or language (i.e. the intension
                                of the model), which together determine the semantics of the model,
                                and an object Omod the attributes of which act as the syntax of the
                                model on the basis of a representational relation between themselves
                                and the semantic model attributes: in the context of a theory and
                                with respect to the respective end, Omod becomes a model of the

                        (in line with established understandings of modelling), one could think of a

                        understanding of textual features relevant to her historical research. In
                        her modelling activity, the researcher maps the theory of text and scholarly
                        language she uses to describe and understand her documents to a digital
                        model of her texts. She may use, for instance, a formalisation of the widely
                        adopted Ordered Hierarchy of Content Objects (OHCO)<a class="noteRef" href="#d17382e360">[6]</a> model combined with a Text Encoding Initiative
                        (TEI) document model. Our researcher chooses a hierarchical model of text
                        (the OHCO model) which she presumably thinks will allow her to map some of
                        her understandings of the historical documents under study to a pre-defined
                        structure (e.g. a TEI schema) and to process those data in some automatic
                        form (e.g. to create indexes of certain selected elements, to perform
                        combined searches or specific content analysis). However, in the modelling
                        process itself she might question deeply the OHCO model as well as the TEI
                        categorisations, reflecting on her own theory of the historical documents at
                        hand and realising the constraints of both theory and model with respect to
                        her objects of interest. She will most likely go back and forth in her
                        modelling efforts to match – based on her knowledge and scholarly language –
                        what she would like to elicit in the document (e.g. the organisation of the
                        diplomatic formulas, the occurrence of names of witnesses in certain
                        locations in the document, the abbreviations occurring in the date clauses)
                        with the formal hierarchical structure proposed by one or more of the TEI
                        guidelines chapters on the encoding of primary sources. Once this mapping
                        reaches a certain stability and she is able to actually process that model,
                        her interpretative activity will likely have to zoom in and out of these
                        manifestations (e.g. between single cases and emerging patterns). She will
                        often puzzle over exceptions that will allow her to iteratively refine the
                        original mapping or require a total rethinking of categories and of the OCHO
                        model being adopted. Single components or parts of the model itself (e.g.
                        the specific schema adopted and its syntax, the technology, the versions of
                        the model at <span class="hi italic">x</span> moments in time) cannot account for
                        the complexity of "model relation" as described
                        above by Kralemann and Lattmann. Within such a reductive analysis of
                        modelling practices, the contextual and relational construction of the
                        semantics of the model as well as its pragmatic end are lost. </div>

                        negotiations over the use of modelling languages (e.g. by renaming
                        categories of analysis or adopting neologisms). The interplay (usually

                        and the model, as well as across different levels of the interpretative

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Models and modelling - pervasive in scientific empirical practices – have become
                    part of the methodological approaches of DH research. Thus the question is: in
                    what way is DH rhetoric and practices not only attracted by but borrowing from
                    the techno-sciences? What <em class="emph">model of modelling</em> can be considered
                        "adequate" to DH? To this end, it is necessary to point
                    out which are the distinctive features of modelling in the humanities. If
                    modelling acts as understood from a semiotic tradition are used to make sense of
                    our cultural objects (mainly but not only texts), they are meaning-making
                    practices and hence in themselves objects of study for the humanities. Indeed,
                    as stated below, the modelling process is often recognised as part of what is
                    being modelled. In this respect it is interesting to note how this applies to
                    natural and literary languages as well as markup languages: <blockquote><p>
                        [...] by its nature the TEI is designed to handle not
                            only the modeling of that data, but also the markers of transcriptional,
                            editorial, and interpretative self-awareness: the non-transparency of
                            the modeling process is itself part of what is being modeled (and again,
                            I would claim that this is a distinctive feature of humanities data
                            modeling).

                        activities in DH.<a class="noteRef" href="#d17382e406">[7]</a> Here we chose to focus
                        on some interrelated aspects of the study of texts, which seem to us
                        particularly relevant to exemplify their complexity and openness with
                        respect to modelling in DH: "dynamicity",
                            "multidimensionality", historicity, and
                        processuality. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">First, we highlight "dynamicity"<a class="noteRef" href="#d17382e433">[8]</a> as an aspect in the study of texts which emerges
                        particularly in the relationship between models and objects as well as
                        models and interpretations. DH researchers have engaged with linear texts
                        all the way towards discontinuous narratives, for instance as structured in
                        relational databases. In addition, texts as objects being modelled in DH
                        research are not only or mainly verbal and encompass hybrid modalities such
                        as maps [<a class="ref" href="#eide2013b">Eide 2013</a>]. Indeed, dynamic aspects of texts as
                        modelled in DH research and connected to the nature of cultural artefacts as
                        such could be exemplified in a variety of ways. Researchers engaged in
                        scholarly digital editing, for instance, have attempted at modelling the
                        whole range of material incarnations of texts and the associated
                        interpretative processes from manuscript witnesses to printed editions, from
                        diplomatic transcriptions to critical editing. Hence, often within one and
                        the same digital editing project, textual models do not sit still; they
                        shift along multiple axes with respect to their objects and interpretations.
                        The models themselves change shape. So, the axis of textual sources vs.
                        models of analysis and interpretation of those same sources is mobile; for
                        example, during the modelling process the sample of sources being selected
                        might reveal new important features to model – such as a late pagination
                        within a codex under study originally not included in the encoding model -
                        which in some cases might also challenge the previous knowledge of those
                        sources such as the biography of that codex. The axis between the textual
                        models and the reading interfaces being generated out of them is also
                        mobile; while developing an interface to a digital edition, the DH modeler
                        might realise that some features of the original encoding model are not
                        refined enough to allow for certain visualisations or specific manipulation
                        of the data.<a class="noteRef" href="#d17382e467">[9]</a>

                        the study of texts that emerges from the relation between objects and
                        interpretations. With this respect, we refer to Sahle’s pluralistic model of
                        text [<a class="ref" href="#sahle2006">Sahle 2006</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#sahle2012">Sahle 2012</a>] which states that the definition of text (e.g.
                        text as semantic and intentional vs. text as version containing specific
                        graphemes; text as complex visual sign vs. text as linguistic utterance;
                        text as material document vs. text as work or rhetorical structure) depends
                        on how we look at it, on the aspects we are most interested in making
                        explicit in our modelling efforts and the tacit knowledge invested in those
                        efforts. This is why the TEI standard aims to account for many models of
                        texts and is a mobile guide in itself.</div>

                        relation to their historical interpretations. The concept of historicity is
                        useful to argue that, usually, in DH, modelling acts are also and
                        necessarily meta-modelling activities because they explicitly engage with
                        non-neutral objects, that is with objects mediated by prior interpretative
                        activities even if not always passing via computational

                        models of texts also embed historical understandings, categorisations and

                        hence also modelling) of texts and our being human. How we read, interpret,

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">In philosophy of science there has been a lively debate around theorisations
                        of models and their position in the middle between theory and data or
                        objects (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#frigg2012">Frigg and Hartmann 2012</a>, 24–25]). Models as used in
                        experimental settings, including computer simulations, are often
                        conceptualised as "mediators between theory and material
                                systems"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#morrison2009">Morrison 2009</a>, 47, note 22]. Hence, also computer simulations, as a special type of model, can be
                        perceived as links "between theory and experiment"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#winsberg2003">Winsberg 2003</a>]. In a simplified view of experimental settings theorised within such
                        frameworks, a rather stable physical system exists; any new knowledge
                        acquired during an experiment is mediated by models of that system (models
                        of materiality) via a causal connection. </div>

                        the techno-sciences we aim to unpack and also suggest directions towards a
                        model of modelling integral to DH research. In the case of computational
                        models, for example, a physical system is represented by a simulation model,
                        which is the result of a "discretizing method"

                        take into account that a pure empiricism where objects and theories are
                        entirely separate entities has been questioned by scientists,
                            philosophers<a class="noteRef" href="#d17382e574">[14]</a> and of course by the framework of quantum

                        that computer simulations in a techno-scientific context seem to be
                        perceived as adding a level of "immateriality" (or better
                            "fictionality") to experimental settings, while in DH
                        they tend to be perceived as adding an element of materiality to humanistic
                            interpretation.<a class="noteRef" href="#d17382e598">[16]</a> The latter resonates in particular with respect to the
                        popular claim of DH as evidence-based humanities - or what we could call a
                        Cartesian approach to the humanities - as well as to the criticism towards

                        mediate this process, but the dichotomy between objects and thoughts, models

                        representation or language as vehicle of theories and methods. That

                        is that the opportunities enabled by modelling (e.g. emergence of patterns
                        of relation, behaviour, and shape) are rooted not only in a "demonstrative" and "literal
                            language" but also in a metaphorical one [<a class="ref" href="#marras2013">Marras 2013</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2006">McCarty 2006</a>]. In the context of modelling, language operates
                        at different levels; for our purposes we could identify at least two: (1)
                        functional and (2) conceptual. In the former case, a language is used to
                        describe a model in descriptive yet operational terms; an example is, for
                        instance, how effectively we apply genealogical terminology (e.g. parent,
                        ancestors, siblings, children) to navigate the hierarchical structure of an
                        XML document or to describe any arboreal organisation of knowledge. On the
                        other hand, in the case of metaphorical language, the terminology being
                        chosen and the relevant metaphorical models being applied organise the
                        modelling processes themselves. Below we provide some examples of what this
                        means in practice.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">DH scholarship has been reflecting on the limits of adopting uncritically one
                        language of computer sciences. Starting from semantic data modelling and the
                        widely adopted yet controversial term of "ontology", Pasin and Ciula,
                        stated that DH approaches seem to privilege a pragmatic rather than a
                        realist understanding of the term in light of the fact that "ontologies for the humanities must support
                                <em class="emph">diversity</em> and <em class="emph">variety of viewpoints</em>; thus
                            they cannot adhere to an underlying model which neglects multiplicity in
                            favor of a monolithic vision of the world." The authors promoted
                        the pragmatic <blockquote><p>
                            concept of an ontology as the <em class="emph">agreement</em>
                                reached by multiple <em class="emph">parties</em> (e.g., programmers,
                                scientists, collaborators, librarians) with the aim of accomplishing
                                some objectives (e.g., data exchange between applications,
                                communication between people, integration of disparate
                                representations). Using a metaphor, ontologies are
                                    <em class="emph">contracts</em>, they are the <em class="emph">currency</em> used
                                to perform some valuable operations. Thus, their importance is
                                ultimately related not to their truth or beauty, but to the ease
                                they bring to the collaboration among people. To use a less
                                    "commercial" metaphor an ontology is a
                                    <em class="emph">compromise</em> or a point of contact between specific
                                and possibly divergent models. The issue is therefore not only to
                                identify commonalities between projects, for instance, but also to
                                agree that the compromises so found wonʼt diminish the value of the
                                underlying idiosyncratic models, the specificity of any single
                                project or interpretation. We believe that in the humanities this
                                agreement is not necessarily reachable once for all or hoped for,
                                because it may imply the negation of the interpretative efforts that
                                make a work or a project unique and the negation of the evolutionary
                                nature of scholarship. However, we also think that the possibility
                                to make two incommensurable categorical systems communicate could be
                                a challenge worth pursuing.

                                phase, factoids provided historians with both a guiding metaphor
                                (helping them conceptualize the broader approach being used) and a
                                usable structure for the data entry work. Secondly, within the

                        new contexts. They are also evidence that, in DH modelling practices,
                        language is not purely observational, but correctable and ambiguous. A model
                        is not an addition to a theory; the non-univocal character of scholarly
                        language has to be recognised. In this perspective, the relationship across
                        borders of disciplines is also to be considered as a translation, which
                        establishes a sort of metaphorical relationship. As the result of an
                            "intercultural marriage" between digital and
                        humanities, DH is a realm of grafting across disciplines. Its scholarship
                        requires adaptable models that are able to grasp such specificity of
                        language as well as models that emerge from the specificity of its theories
                        and objects of analysis, models which emerge out of a modelling process not
                        directly linked to its observational contexts. Without diminishing the value
                        of formal and functional languages at the interface between human and

                    scholarship depends on how imaginative our act of modelling is. According to
                    Godfrey-Smith, it is the modeler’s "talk" which
                    fictionalises models and makes them become objects independently of how they are
                    expressed and of where they lie on the continuum between analytic (or
                    descriptive) models adhering to physical objects, on one hand, and schematic (or
                    idealised) models, on the other. He states: "Richly realistic novels are akin to elaborate computer
                            simulations. Spare and schematic fictions are akin to abstract analytic
                            models. Parables are like narrative algebra"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#godfrey-smith2009">Godfrey-Smith 2009</a>, 107]. Both "models and stories" are used in the
                    techno-sciences and the humanities and both are to be contextualised in space
                    and time: <blockquote><p>
                        Fictions do not have the same role in all of science.
                            They are a particular kind of tool, and their role changes over time and
                            space. Since WWII, model-based science has probably become more
                            prominent, and more recognizable as a distinct strategy rather than an
                            ingredient in a blend. (This would make some sense of the earlier
                            tendency to see fictionalizing as either everywhere or nowhere.)
                            Thinking and talking of model systems as imaginary <span class="foreign i">concreta</span> may have become more noticeable,
                            too. This is perhaps especially due to the role played by computers.
                            Computers have turned attention away from analytical methods to some
                            extent. They also make it possible to model more causal detail, and are
                            powerful tools for visualization.

                    coding and to see how it can scale up to do critical scholarship with/via it.

                        modelling brings into focus a middle-out method which acts at the crossing
                        point between data and models adapting itself to specific "textual
                            contexts". Three interrelated properties belonging to
                        pragmatics (adapted from [<a class="ref" href="#verschueren2012">Verschueren 2012</a>]) can be associated
                        with this method and explain how metaphorical reasoning functions: <ul class="list"><li class="item">Variability - the range of choices in the use of language cannot

                                implying the indeterminacy and unexclusiveness of the choices being

                        to a creative and imaginative dimension. In this context, metaphors often
                        function as models to integrate the interpretation of theories, especially
                        when there are not terms or concepts to be used that are directly related to

                        theoretical sciences, in representing and describing a domain, and in
                        promoting understanding in scientific investigation. Scientific metaphors
                        are pervasive in science from antiquity to our time, from Aristotle’s <cite class="title italic">De Partibus Animalium</cite>, to the early modern
                        scientific attitude to modelling as a partnership with craftsmanship and
                        engineering; from the notion of the world machine, of God as artisan or
                        architect and the world as his handicraft, to Darwin’s "tree of life", from the mind-computer to the protein-protein
                        interaction as network in more recent science. Metaphors often act through
                        different "pragmatic" mechanisms directly related to the
                        properties listed above: from transposition - moving concepts from a context
                        to another (variability), to corrections and interpretations due to new
                        contexts (negotiability), to its reformulation (adaptability to new
                        contexts). Metaphors describe novelties, help in understanding and
                        interpreting theories but should not be reduced to be simply the language of
                        a model [<a class="ref" href="#hoffman1985">Hoffman 1985</a>]. In this sense, the use of metaphors is
                        a strategy to guarantee a non-rigid, descriptive approach to modelling. This
                        allows the preservation of the "openness" of a middle-out

                        not only linguistic entities; an interesting range of metaphors in DH is
                        used for structuring concepts at a macro-level, for example, in the use of "ecosystem"

                        main features and aims of a research project, for instance in the use of

                    objects of analysis (such as texts, Section 2.1) and of certain explorative and
                    epistemological strategies of analysis (such as modelling, see 2.2) we have
                    attempted to show how a pragmatic framework can be used to contextualise DH
                    research (under 3.1). Such a framework is useful because it emphasises the
                    fallacy of rigid polarities (object vs. model; model vs. theory) and the
                    prominent role of language in the central activity of modelling in Digital
                    Humanities. What we call "pragmatic modeling" is not a new
                    approach but rather a more adequate explanatory framework for existing practices
                    that combine formal and experimental modelling techniques with a constructive
                    use of language.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">Indeed, this de-dichotomisation reveals that modelling practices are constrained

                    show how metaphorical language facilitates cohesion and coherence within theory
                    and practice. Therefore, we draw attention to the role metaphors assume in
                    organising and structuring knowledge in DH and within its modelling activities

                    in DH. Indeed, on one hand, we take the insider’s perspective by accounting for
                    these practices and by treating our models as independent objects to study and
                    manipulate, but on the other hand, we enact the outsider’s critical perspective
                    of self-reflexivity by highlighting the metaphorical nature of the DH modeler’s

                    instance, it would be useful to corroborate our work with a diachronic and
                    historical analysis of the role of metaphors in DH and build a map of
                    DH-specific as well as wider thematic metaphors. In order to further explore the
                    relationship between theory and practice within DH models of modeling, it will
                    be important to develop appropriate <span class="foreign i">ad hoc</span>
                    guiding frameworks (based on case studies designed around the needs of specific

                                    constructive and creative process and that the functions of the
