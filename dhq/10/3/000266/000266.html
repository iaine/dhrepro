                <p>This review finds that Jockers' <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite> provides a clear and provocative
                    argument in favor of literary critics' use of data mining in
                    their efforts to understand literary history. The review
                    finds Jockers' case for a blended approach, one that
                    combines data mining with close-reading techniques,
                    compelling, and it finds, in addition, that his claim that
                    such an approach holds the potential to revolutionize
                    literary study to be a fair assessment of the possibities
                    offered by data mining tools and techniques.</p>
            </div>
            
        
        
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">A friend recently asked me, with a smile and in the friendliest
                way possible, "What does a professor of literature actually
                    do? Don’t you just spout off about the real meaning of a
                    great work of literature? Are your books really scholarship
                    or just your own opinions?" He sought me out after his
                oldest daughter announced that she wanted to get a Ph.D. in
                English. He had not only heard horror stories about the job
                market for Humanities PhDs but was also absolutely baffled, even
                after she explained to him, as to what literature professors
                published and whether it had any value. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">When I tell this story to my colleagues, they often refer to the
                so-called "crisis in the Humanities" as a way to
                contextualize these questions as part of an attack on the
                humanities in general. I believe this is, at least to some
                extent, absolutely correct. Just focusing on English departments
                (the subsection of the humanities I know best), universities
                across the country report steep declines in the number of
                students majoring in English; students who complete a PhD in
                English face an abysmal job market in which full-time positions
                are a rare species available to a decreasing number of
                graduates; and those who get a job at a place where a book is
                required for tenure face an increasing number of academic
                presses reluctant to publish their first book because of the
                plummeting sales of literary studies. My colleagues hear not
                only the fears of a concerned father but also, and even more
                powerfully, echoes of what administrators at their universities
                ask them when they request new faculty positions (if, that is,
                they are lucky enough to work at a university that is even
                willing to consider expanding full-time positions in literature
                departments).</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The readers of this journal see that the digital humanities,
                which has a long history dating back at least to the 1940s, has
                emerged in this crisis as a major topic of conversation among
                scholars and administrators associated with the humanities. I
                will forgo offering here my own speculations about why DH has
                gained the prominence it has amidst the ruins of the
                institutional humanities. DH occupies, for journalists reporting
                on the humanities and conference attendees in the humanities,
                the very similar position of "the next big thing"
                previously occupied by theory (which, like the term "digital
                    humanities," I mean not a unified or uniform set of
                practices, ideas, projects, writings, products, ideologies,
                methods, etc. but rather as a very imprecise shorthand for a set
                of practices, etc. that are, for better or worse, grouped
                together). DH appeals to me for precisely the same reason as
                theory and, quite frankly, as the questions posed by the
                friendly parent. DH and theory each ask those interested in the
                humanities to ask themselves why we do what we do the way we do
                it. What do we learn when we close-read a literary text? What
                assumptions about our goals, aims, and values are embedded
                within the methods of close-reading? What relationship does
                history bear to literature — what, after all, is the difference
                between the categories of history and literature, if any, and
                what ends do these distinctions serve? Indeed, why do we have
                literature departments at all?</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Matthew Jockers’ <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite> asks
                us — sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly — to engage in
                just this kind of reexamination of how and why literary scholars
                analyze texts. He makes a clear, engaging, and provocative case
                for the potential value of data mining for studying literature.
                Jockers calls the approach that serves as the title of his book
                    "a new methodology" that demands
                a "new way of thinking about [literary
                        scholars’] object of study"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 4]. We are, Jockers tells us, at "a moment of revolution [in] the way we
                        study the literary record"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 171], a moment where how — if not why, though this, of course,
                is always connected to questions of "how" — we study
                literature is changing in fundamental ways. <cite class="title italic">Macroanaysis </cite>seeks to buttress Jockers’ contention
                that "the study of literature should be
                        approached not simply as an examination of seminal works
                        but as an examination of an aggregated ecosystem or
                            'economy' of texts"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 32]. Data mining, according to Jockers, will very likely
                provide "new knowledge" about larger
                trends in literary history and, in the process, give analysts
                    "a fuller sense of the
                    literary-historical milieu in which a given book
                    exists"
                [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 28]. The "data sets" now
                available to scholars make it possible to understand individual
                texts in relation to an almost "comprehensive" context of
                other relevant texts [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 7]. Far
                from being a threat to the very soul of literary studies, as
                some scholars fear, Jockers demonstrates that computational
                tools can work in tandem with traditional methods of analysis.
                Jockers argues for what he calls "a blended approach" that
                puts data mining in conversation with close-reading of
                individual texts, an approach that, he contends, will allow
                analysts to "better understand the context in which
                        individual texts exist and thereby better understand
                        those individual texts"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 26, 27]. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">To make the case for the value of data mining in literary study,
                    <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite> is divided into
                three sections: Foundation, Analysis, and Prospects. Foundation
                provides an overview in four chapters — titled, respectively,
                    "Revolution,"
                "Evidence,"
                "Tradition," and "Macroanalysis" — of the potential
                value of data mining for literary scholars. "Revolution"
                differentiates data mining from close-reading, the method he
                argues has come to dominate literary studies; "Evidence"
                contrasts the kind of evidentiary material data mining produces
                to the kind derived from a close, careful reading of a text by
                an individual analyst; "Analysis" examines data mining in
                relation to the history of humanities computing as a way of
                differentiating it from other forms of computational and/or
                digital approaches; and "Prospects" briefly discusses some
                of the issues and questions the methodology of macroanalysis
                seems particularly well-suited to address, especially in
                contrast to close-reading. In Part II of the book, the Analysis
                section, Jockers uses data mining tools on a database composed
                of nineteenth-century Irish-American fiction to explore
                questions of Irish-American identity written by writers with
                Irish roots. If the first section can be said to lay out the
                theoretical justification for a macroanalytical method, the
                Analysis section aims to show that, in practice, macroanalysis
                can, first, yield knowledge about familiar topics that challenge
                a particular field of literary study’s conventional wisdom, a
                wisdom borne out of earlier models of analysis, and/or, second,
                generate insights about issues that hadn’t occurred to scholars
                in the field using conventional methods of analysis. Since
                Jockers focuses here on nineteenth-century American fiction by
                Irish-American authors about Irish identity, a set of authors
                and issues about which I have little expertise, I will refrain
                from judging the success of Jockers’ use of data mining in this
                instance. I do find it significant, though, for reasons I will
                mention below, that Jockers uses his computational tools to
                explore four analytical categories, categories which also serve
                as chapter titles for this section: "Style,"
                "Nationality,"
                "Theme," and "Influence."</div>

                faculty in the vast majority of literature departments in the
                United States were entirely ignorant of humanities computing, I
                find myself excited and energized by the possibilities data
                mining offers. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">What about data mining prompts my excitement? First, I think that
                we don’t know what we don’t know. While it might end up being
                true that data mining will provide us exclusively and absolutely
                only with insights and information that we already knew, I find
                this possibility to be exceptionally unlikely. Second, as
                Jockers points out so well in various places in <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite>, data mining will allow
                analysts to read any single work from a large corpus in the
                context of every work within that corpus in a way that has,
                prior to this, been virtually impossible. Though Jockers focuses
                more on the big picture of literary history here, the
                implications of data mining for our understanding of individual
                texts will be, among other things, that many, many, many new
                readings of canonical and non-canonical works will be possible.
                Who knows what such new readings will produce, but I am willing
                to wager a great deal that out of the many new readings borne
                out of data mining at least some — and all one needs is one —
                will help us see an individual work of literature (and, as a
                part of the whole of literature, all of literature as well) in a
                new way. Jockers is certainly right when he says that no one
                scholar can process all the published writing of the fields in
                which we tend to divide literary studies. Even if one could read
                every novel published in the United States between 1800 and
                1899, for instance, the human mind just can’t process the
                material — can’t, as it were, hold it all in one’s head at the
                same time in the way a computer can. To be sure, the human mind
                can do many things a computer cannot, but processing enormous
                bodies of data isn’t one of those things. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">As I noted above, Jockers speaks of the turn to data mining as a
                revolution. I think the word "revolution" is well chosen.
                Trends, relationships, patterns, and meanings in the histories
                of literatures across the world that had previously been
                invisible will come into view when we unleash the many digital
                processing tools on the bits of data that are now readily
                available. I think it is safe to say that these tools will,
                taken as a whole, help us see anew the various literary
                histories we study. Revolutions can occur, at least in some
                instances, when one sees a familiar object or set of objects in
                a fundamentally new way. So, it seems to me, if macroanalysis or
                even other methods that grow out of data mining do, as I think
                they will, produce new insights about familiar literary
                histories and new ways of understanding literature — what it is,
                what it does, how it should be understood, what it’s value is,
                etc. — it will bring about revolutions in the way we
                conceptualize, read, study, and teach literary works. Perhaps
                even more exciting, by integrating explicitly computational
                methods into literary analysis and hiring people who have
                extensive computational skills in literature departments, we
                will, I think, change the nature of literary study by broadening
                the way it can be processed and understood. Works that advocate
                the use of data mining and other computational methods such as
                    <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite> demonstrate the
                need for at least some literature scholars to receive training
                as programmers, statisticians, and data visualization
                specialists. By viewing literature through such new lenses,
                literary study will remain, I believe, literary study — just as
                it has while incorporating insights from psychology, history,
                book production, neuroscience, and other fields — but it will be
                even more inclusive and extensive in the tools it brings to bear
                on the literary object.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">What Jockers and I find exciting and potentially revolutionary
                about data mining often do not coincide, though. I found that
                Jockers’ decision to focus on Style, Nationality, Theme, and
                Influence in his database drained the revolutionary potential
                out of data mining. From my perspective as a scholar of American
                literature trained in the 1980s, the categories Jockers choose
                seemed more counter-revolutionary than revolutionary. Each of
                these categories is quite old and familiar in the study of
                American literature. They constitute, in fact, foundational
                categories. The professional study of American literature in the
                academy can be dated to the 1920s and 30s. The flagship journal
                in the field, <cite class="title italic">American Literature</cite>,
                lists March 1929 as the date of its first issue, and the
                journal’s first few years include many essays devoted to
                questions of theme, style, nationality, and influence. My quick
                search of essay titles from the first five years of <cite class="title italic">American Literature</cite> just focused on
                influence, and I found plenty, including "The Influence of European Ideas in Nineteenth-Century
                    America"; "The Influence of Edgar
                    Allan Poe into Ambrose Bierce"; "The Influence of Milton on Colonial American
                Poetry"; and "The Influence of
                    Persian Poetry upon Emerson’s Work."</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">On the one hand, the categories Jockers chose are foundational
                for a reason. They are, well, foundational. Sticking again with
                influence, I found it disappointing that Jockers chose not to
                engage with some of the most recent works that offer rather
                complex analyses, theories, meditations, etc. on the very notion
                of influence and what its various forms might look like. He
                cites Harold Bloom’s <cite class="title italic">Anxiety of
                    Influence</cite>, which was published more than forty years
                ago (in 1973). Jockers, of course, gets to write his own book,
                but I think an engagement with the way "influence" — and
                style, theme, and nationality — has been discussed by writers
                subsequent to Bloom, writers who were/are part of the so-called
                theory revolution in literary studies, would have added greatly to Macroanalysis’ contribution to the
                current dialogue about the digital humanities. This revolution
                happened immediately after Bloom’s book and, to some extent,
                managed to remain the dominant way to read literature in the top
                journals in the discipline. At Brown, and many other peer
                universities across the United States, the theory revolution so
                transformed the way literature was studied and taught in English
                departments that few of my colleagues mention theme, style, or
                influence in their published writings (and, if they do, their
                use of these terms would be almost unrecognizable to the authors
                of the essays from <cite class="title italic">American
                    Literature</cite> I list above). For better or for worse,
                style, theme, and influence are rarely discussed at any length
                in courses taught by faculty here, and I include myself in this
                group. Literature is often not taught in terms of themes,
                influence, or style (for the most part) but rather in terms of
                problems, issues, questions, enabling contradictions, and
                ideologies.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">I have no idea whether Jockers wants his focus on such rather
                old-school categories understood in ways that predate the theory
                revolution to be part of a counter-revolution that will take
                back literary studies from the theorists. I do not find enough
                evidence in <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis </cite>to
                support the conclusion that Jockers argues for the more
                    "objective" method of data mining in order to displace
                the admittedly less "objective" analyses one finds in works
                steeped in literary theory — and, quite frankly, it means little
                to me whether he intends the book to be part of a move to wrest
                literary studies away from the theorists. Influence, theme,
                nationality, and style remain important categories in literary
                study, in spite of the changes wrought in the field over the
                last fifty years, and they deserve to be studied in a variety of
                different ways. My point here is simply that, from my
                perspective, the provocative nature of data mining lies
                precisely in its potential to help us think about literature in
                    "traditional" and "nontraditional" ways. Jockers
                uses macroanalysis to learn about individual authors in relation
                to the economy of nineteenth-century American literature. I want
                to use data mining to learn about the economy of
                nineteenth-century American literature without recourse to
                individual authors. Jockers focuses on the potential of data
                mining to reveal things about individual authors and large
                movements in literary history. I am interested in how data
                mining might reveal trends that exceed the control of individual
                authors. In many respects, Jockers and I are not so far apart.
                He speculates that after much research we might find that
                literary trends obey an "evolutionary" model — a
                speculation, whatever its plausibility, and I admit I am
                skeptical — that puts the question of individual human agency at
                the forefront [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>, 155–156]. Who is
                driving the evolutionary steps: individual authors or forces
                that are beyond the control of individuals? </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">In spite of these differences in emphases, I found <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite> to offer a clear and
                engaging argument for the possibilities of data mining for
                literary scholars. I hope many scholars take up his call.
                Literary scholarship will benefit immensely from the use of big
                data in its analyses of individual works and massive histories.
                We need books like <cite class="title italic">Macroanalysis</cite> to
                offer ways of processing and incorporating and using the new
                forms of data scholars will be using. While I might differ from
                Jockers on just how to parse the data, these differences are
                precisely the kind that have animated literary scholarship since
                its beginnings in the nineteenth century. </div>
