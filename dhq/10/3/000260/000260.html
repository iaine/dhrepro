                <p>For the past century, the sciences have made terrific strides in capturing the
                    public imagination. From dedicated television channels to online learning
                    materials to science-related entertainment and educational facilities for
                    families in practically every major city on the planet, the scale of public
                    relations has been impressive and continuous. However, the same cannot be said
                    for the Humanities. Although we certainly have cultural institutions for adults,
                    ranging from art galleries to opera houses, their primary emphasis has been on
                    providing opportunities for passively consuming cultural production, rather than
                    with the core interest of the Humanities, which is in enriching objects of study
                    by analyzing them through a variety of theoretical lenses. In this paper, I
                    argue, as others have been doing for some time, that the Humanities need to
                    learn in this respect from the sciences, in order to increase their public
                    stature. Further, the driving force behind this education is Digital Humanities.
                    Since public relations has been on the back burner for so long, this initiative
                    is both important and daunting; it is one of the ways in which the Digital
                    Humanities are strengthening the Humanities while at the same time encouraging
                    them in a task that seems difficult enough that everyone wishes it was not
                    necessary.</p>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">At some point around the turn of the millennium, I was shown a graph of federal
                    research funding in the USA. It was divided into the conventional three
                    categories used in North America, and presumably elsewhere: Medicine, Science,
                    and the Humanities. What was astonishing about the graph was that it only had
                    two bars. The bar for medical research reached to the top of the page, and the
                    bar for scientific research was about a third of the page. But the bar for
                    support for research in the Humanities was invisible at this scale — you would
                    have had to use log paper for it to appear. I used to point to this graph, where
                    the Humanities bar should have been, and say, "Here is where I get my
                        research funding." The situation hasn’t changed. Figure 1 shows a
                    similar graph from a 2014 report of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
                    except medical research has been separated from biological research, and there
                    are three columns for the sciences and Engineering. By dint of these changes,
                    the Humanities are visible, but barely.<a class="noteRef" href="#d20317e182">[1]</a></div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The discrepancy in research support is a surprise to no one. Traditional wisdom
                    has it that the Humanities don’t need money, because the kinds of research
                    equipment required are mostly books and other kinds of written material, with an
                    occasional bit of travel to find books or writings that aren’t available
                    locally. Even graduate students are treated as independent entities, for whom
                    individual funding programs are not usually associated with the research program
                    of the supervising faculty member. The reasoning is that in the sciences, grad
                    students typically join a lab, and most often pick up a research project that is
                    part of the larger program of research of the supervisor. Grad students in the
                    Humanities, however, typically consult with the supervisor, but in essence
                    choose an independent project — then sit somewhere and read their own books. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The only problem with this model is that traditional wisdom is not entirely
                    accurate, and is downright inaccurate when it comes to research in the Digital
                    Humanities (DH). We digital humanists tend to be dealing with different issues —
                    in some cases, actually creating the objects of study in order to address
                    particular questions, and in others, building online collections, experimenting
                    with a variety of algorithms, trying out visualizations, and so on. Although it
                    is still unusual for a graduate student to join a DH lab, it does happen, and it
                    happens with increasing frequency. DH research also often calls for more
                    experimentation, less solitude, interdisciplinary teams of researchers, a
                    broader range of more powerful equipment, and so on. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">There has been some recognition of this change in the creation of specialized
                    funding programs for DH in several countries, including Canada and the US;
                    adding to their funding levels, however, still produces just a tiny movement in
                    the overall graph for Humanities research funding. The deprecation of learning
                    in the Western world as a public benefit and an essential component of democracy
                    has been almost unremitting for a generation, and even the disciplines outside
                    the humanities are beginning to see the effects. For example, a <cite class="title italic">Huffington Post</cite> article from 2014 cites a recent study
                    showing that illiteracy in the US has held steady at a ridiculous rate for a
                    decade: <blockquote><p>According to a study conducted in late April by the
                        U.S. Department of Education and the National Institute of Literacy, 32
                        million adults in the U.S. can't read. That's 14 percent of the population.
                        21 percent of adults in the U.S. read below a 5th grade level, and 19
                        percent of high school graduates can't read [<a class="ref" href="#huffington2014">Huffington Post 2014</a>].</p></blockquote></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Literacy is a relatively low bar, and although in its basic form it is associated
                    with primary education, at its higher levels it is required for medical and
                    scientific research, and those higher levels have traditionally been in the
                    wheelhouse of the Humanities. That a fifth of the adult population in the U.S.
                    hasn’t achieved even the basic levels suggests that there are systemic problems;
                    once again, this state of affairs is not news to anyone. I hesitate somewhat to
                    use literacy statistics, because they are notoriously politicized, but
                    anecdotally, I meet people in the US who appear to have no literacy and little
                    or no numeracy. Some of them are holding jobs, but usually there appear to be
                    some workarounds in place to allow that to happen. For example, retail outlets
                    like McDonalds use cash registers where the keys are images of the products,
                    rather than numbers.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">What is also clear, at least anecdotally, is that the Humanities don’t get much
                    respect from the rest of the campus. It is rarely the case that upper
                    administration at major research institutions has a background in the
                    Humanities: a 2012 study by the American Council on Education found that
                    40 percent of college and university presidents in the US have backgrounds in
                    Education, and another 20 percent come from industry [<a class="ref" href="#cook2012">Cook 2012</a>].
                    It is also often the case that the Humanities face funding cuts that are
                    disproportionate to the rest of the campus. At the major Canadian research
                    university where I used to work, the humanities had a three-year hiring freeze
                    at a time when the College of Engineering had a standing open call for 100 new
                    faculty members. We were nickel-and-dimed for everything from photocopies to
                    office space, culminating in a cost-cutting measure where every faculty member
                    in the Department of English and Film Studies had the telephones removed from
                    their offices. Although it was probably intended to make a statement of some
                    kind, the statement it actually made was that there was no need for faculty in
                    that department to be reached through that medium, whether by colleagues,
                    students, potential students, or the media. I spoke some years ago with one of
                    the professors in Engineering to find out what he thought about it. "I keep
                        watching," he said, "for something exciting to be happening over
                        on your side of campus, and the only thing I’ve seen in a long time is what
                        is going on in Digital Humanities." I was nonplussed; exciting
                    research is being done in the Humanities all the time. The difference was that
                    DH was visible in his world.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In order to make their positive impact known, the Humanities need to rear up on
                    their hind legs and make some bold statements about what they are trying to
                    accomplish. Moreover, it is likely that they need to make those statements in
                    such a way that they will reach someone other than the choir — namely, the tens
                    of millions of illiterate adults. A hundred years ago, Medicine was not a
                    significant research discipline, and although doctors were valued, many were
                    valued in terms of domestic produce such as chickens and jars of jam, much like
                    members of the clergy. Lewis Thomas, for example, remembers how his father would
                    celebrate if he received his entire fee immediately; the idea that anyone would
                    enter Medicine as a means of obtaining capital wealth was laughable [<a class="ref" href="#thomas1983">Thomas 1983</a>, 3]. A hundred years before that, the term
                        <em class="term">science</em> was being deprecated as an unreasonable barbarism, far
                    inferior to the more ambitious and exalted <em class="term">natural philosophy</em> of an

                    We are living in what used to be the future, and it is terrific in many ways.
                    For example, medical research has vastly reduced the instances of cholera, and
                    the same can be said for a wide range of afflictions, including calamities like
                    polio, where up until less than 60 years ago, all that could be done was to
                    stick people in a giant metal coffin that reduced the air pressure enough that
                    they could breathe. Governments, NGOs, and the public in general may debate the
                    high costs of health care, but no one suggests that the solution is to stop
                    doing medical research; there are enough success stories to more than justify
                    its existence, and the health it helps to support is recognized as important by
                    practically everyone. </div>

                    to the Internet; hardly a year goes by without someone announcing a new kind of
                    crop, a new device, a new material. For the sciences, however, the commitment of
                    third parties is less secure, since the connection to personal benefit is not so
                    visceral. I am, however, personally looking forward to having tiny little repair
                    robots in my blood, combining science research with medical research once again

                    depth and richness to how we understand the world. What is going on, we now ask,

                    and reporting from different perspectives — more like building up a pearl than
                    climbing up a ladder. As I often put it, we are not trying to solve Shakespeare

                    opportunities. It is increasingly believed in government and industry that the
                    problems worth addressing are wicked problems, and the opportunities are in this
                    sense wicked too. For example, the language of the "Grand Challenge,"
                    meaning a global wicked problem/opportunity, is being used by organizations such
                    as USAID, Grand Challenges Canada, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
                    Although the vast bulk of resources is currently being allocated to projects of
                    a technical nature, the Humanities are well positioned in both theoretical and

                    introducing the students to corpus linguistics, a field that in the University
                    of Alberta is located in the Faculty of Arts. Her approach was exemplary. She
                    began by talking about slang and how it changes over time: "What kinds of

                        really like something?" As the responses came in, she used the
                    interface to one of the online corpora to show the graphs of use of the word,
                    and how it varied between use in speaking, in writing, and so on. From there she
                    called up graphs of words the young people used: at the time one of them was
                        "awesome," which showed a spike in recent usage (Fig. 4).</div>

                    children, but instead was using the actual online tools on real data. Second,
                    her emphasis was not on the field of study (reporting, for instance, some recent
                    findings), but instead on the techniques. Third, she applied those techniques to
                    material that was quite likely to get everyone’s imagination engaged. </div>

                         [<a class="ref" href="#shakespeare2000">Shakespeare 2000</a>, 72]. She is, of course, in for a surprise. The real interpretations are much
                    more sophisticated and nuanced than these brief examples could ever be, but they
                    serve to get the strategy across.</div>

                <h1 class="head">Public Service Announcements (PSAs)</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Although they are not as common on television as they once were, nor as common in
                    North America as in other parts of the world, the PSA has a venerable history as
                    a kind of commercial that is selling ideas rather than commodities. If the
                    humanities and their core activities are not well known or understood by the
                    general public, whoever that might be, PSAs could be another quick and
                    comparatively easy form of dissemination. Whatever contemporary form they take,
                    whether web videos, tweets, blog posts, or any other media, the principles are
                    the same: keep them short, simple, and friendly.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">As an example, I worked with Milena Radzikowska, Gerry Derksen, and others on a
                    series of one-minute video clips about design research projects. Design research
                    is another area that is not well understood by the public, and can benefit from
                    increased dissemination. We have therefore been briefly summarizing projects
                    like pill identification, visualization for decision support, and conversational
                    modeling. However, there are also short videos about a variety of DH-related
                    design research projects, such as the mandala browser, bubblelines, and the
                    dynamic table of contexts [<a class="ref" href="#iit2014">IIT Institute of Design Vimeo Channel 2014</a>]. Unfortunately, as in all
                    marketing efforts, it is nearly impossible to judge the impact of a single
                    project. All we really know is that some people have watched them, and with more
                    promotion, more people might, and with every viewer, we have extended awareness
                    of what design research is like.</div>

                <h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">Public relations have not been a central concern for the Humanities, for several
                    reasons. First is the cost of marketing and promotion, which is not easily
                    justified in an area where core programs have already faced decades of budget
                    cuts.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">Next is the nature of the activity being promoted. Since one of the primary
                    purposes of the Humanities is to multiply valid interpretations, the ground is
                    constantly shifting, not in an accidental or secondary way, but instead as a
                    central practice. Changes in perspective are core to the Humanities approach to
                    creating new knowledge (or improved understanding, as you prefer), and so any
                    promotional activity faces the challenge of not having a fixed object to
                    promote. From the perspective of the people whose work is being promoted, the
                    fundamental necessity of troubling any assumptions being made also creates a
                    challenge. The simplification process that is often necessary in creating a
                    public message is inimical to the kind of nuanced understanding that Humanities
                    researchers see as the point of the enterprise. From the marketing perspective,
                    this can appear as an incessant tendency to quibble. Possible workarounds might
                    include highlighting debates rather than outcomes, and including dissenting
                    viewpoints in sidebars or footnotes to the promotional materials.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">To complicate matters further, the accumulation of widely-accepted perspectives
                    takes place over long stretches of time, with validation processes carried out
                    in discussions that rely on publication cycles that take years for each
                    carefully-crafted statement to be made. Occasional media-genic moments, like
                    Lancashire and Hirst [<a class="ref" href="#lancashire2009">Lancashire and Hirst 2009</a>, 1] using text analysis
                    to diagnose Altzheimer’s disease, are amazing and wonderful, but also
                    extraordinary; they cannot be construed as representing a general program of
                    action. This is less a criticism of the Humanities than it is of the capacity
                    of the media to cover work that does not easily produce press releases.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Another factor is that the value of the Humanities has largely been assumed to be
                    understood. However, the allocation of resources over time argues otherwise. As
                    shown in Figure 1, above, research funding in the U.S.A. from 2005 to 2012
                    (adjusted for inflation) increased on the order of $5 billion each in fields
                    such as medicine, biology, and engineering, while remaining more or less fixed
                    in the Humanities [<a class="ref" href="#aaas2014">American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences 2014</a>, 4]. Admittedly, this is hard to
                    judge from the graph, since the Humanities allocation is nearly invisible to
                    begin with. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">We also live in a world that is increasingly undereducated, not only in the sense
                    of people not attending school, but also in the decrease of general education in
                    favour of early specialization. At my current university, it is possible, by
                    focused selection of electives, for undergraduate students in one of the
                    technical departments to take virtually no courses outside their major. So the
                    time may have arrived for the development of public relations campaigns, whether
                    in the form of new television or online programming and dedicated channels, the
                    establishment of Humanities discovery centers, or the expansion of the
                    application of humanities approaches to a larger range of cultural production,
                    including business and government. The Digital Humanities have already been
                    active in pursuing this agenda, and in that respect provide an opportunity and
                    challenge to the traditional Humanities and their concerns. However, a great
                    deal more remains to be accomplished.</div>
