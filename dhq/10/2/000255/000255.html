                <p>Referring constitutes such an essential scholarly activity across disciplines
                    that it has been regarded by [<a class="ref" href="#unsworth2000">Unsworth 2000</a>] as one of the
                    scholarly primitives. In Classics, in particular, the references to passages of
                    the ancient texts — the so-called <em class="emph">canonical citations</em> (or
                        <em class="emph">references</em>) — play a prominent role. The potential of these
                    citations, however, has not been fully exploited to date, despite the attention
                    that they have recently received in the field of Digital Humanities.</p>
                <p>In this paper I discuss two aspects of making such citations computable. Firstly,
                    I illustrate how they can be extracted from text by using Natural Language
                    Processing techniques, especially Named Entity Recognition. Secondly, I discuss
                    the creation of a three-level citation network to formalise the web of relations
                    between texts that canonical references implicitly constitute. As I outline in
                    the conclusive section of this paper, the possible uses of the extracted
                    citation network include the development of search applications and recommender
                    systems for bibliography; the enhancement of digital environments to read
                    primary sources with links to related secondary literature; and the application
                    of these network to the study of intertextuality and text reception. </p>

                <h1 class="head">1 Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Over the last two centuries Classics scholars have developed sophisticated tools
                    and strategies to find relevant information they need for their work. These
                    tools are aimed at making resources more easily accessible and include indexes
                    of cited passages, specialised concordances and extensive bibliographic reviews,
                    both critical and analytical. The fact that they are manually curated and
                    therefore highly accurate, is what makes these resources valuable but time
                    consuming to produce. This constitutes also the main limit of these resources as
                    they cannot cope with the sheer amount of materials made available by
                    large-scale digital libraries.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The result of this situation is that, when it comes to finding relevant resources
                    within digital archives such as JSTOR, classicists are usually left with search
                    functionalities based on string matching algorithms. In order to be exhaustive,
                    a query to retrieve all journal articles that discuss a given ancient work needs
                    to contain all variant spelling and abbreviations of the work title in several
                    languages. For example, an exhaustive search for publications on Virgil's <cite class="title italic">Georgics</cite> would need to include variant spellings of
                    the title such as <cite class="title italic">Georgica</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Georgics</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Géorgiques</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Georgiche</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Geórgicas</cite> and
                    abbreviations such as "<cite class="title italic">Georg.</cite>" and the less
                    common "<cite class="title italic">G.</cite>". However, since building manually
                    similar queries is rather inconvenient, a more scalable approach is required in
                    order to provide scholars with the means of finding resources that are relevant
                    to their research within large-scale digital archives.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The workbench of the 21<span class="hi superscript">st</span> century classicist ought to
                    offer more advanced means of searching for bibliographic information: a search
                    for "Georgics" should return records that mention the title of the work in
                    any of its variant forms or that cite specific sections of the poem (e.g.
                        "Verg. <cite class="title italic">G.</cite> 1.34", "Verg. <cite class="title italic">Georg.</cite> III 481 ", etc.). Furthermore, it should
                    be possible to search for articles on both Vergil and Lucan or articles that
                    cite a specific set of text passages (e.g. Verg. <cite class="title italic">Aen.</cite> 12.942 <em class="emph">and</em> Lucan 1.244). Such a specialised
                    search, deemed by [<a class="ref" href="#crane2009">Crane, Seales, and Terras 2009</a>] to be one of the essential
                    components of a cyberinfrastructure for Classics, is likely to have a particular
                    impact on areas of study such as intertextuality where citations to primary
                    sources play a key role.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Previous studies in the field of Digital Humanities have almost exclusively
                    focused on the hypertextual dimension of canonical citations. Issues that were
                    tackled by these studies include how — and with what consequences — such
                    citations can technically be transformed into links and what new functionalities
                    can thereby be provided in a digital reading environment [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2002">McCarty 2002</a>]

                    [<a class="ref" href="#kalvesmaki2014">Kalvesmaki 2014</a>]. In this paper I turn my attention to two
                    additional aspects of these citations. First, how can they be extracted
                    automatically from text? Second, how can the web of relations that these
                    references constitute be formalised as a network? To illustrate my approach to
                    these two issues I use a sample of reviews taken from <cite class="title italic">L’Année Philologique</cite> in which canonical references were
                    semi-automatically annotated.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">This paper is organised as follows. In the first part I describe how canonical
                    citations can automatically be extracted by applying Natural Language Processing
                    (NLP) techniques. In the second part I discuss the creation of a citation
                    network starting from the automatically extracted canonical references. The
                    importance of such a network lies in that it gives formal representation to the
                    web of relationships between texts that these references implicitly already
                    constitute. I conclude this paper by sketching out what are the applications and
                    further uses that such a citation network enables.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">A considerable amount of time in Digital Humanities research is spent in trying
                    to give a formal, computational formulation to problems of interest to
                    humanities scholars. Broadly speaking, this is done by translating the problems
                    into computational terms, turning them into computable tasks and representing
                    them by means of data models. This process involves adapting existing methods
                    and tools developed in disciplines such as Computer Science or Physics to these
                    new scenarios as well as developing new ones. This certainly holds true for the
                    extraction of citations to classical texts that are found in modern
                    publications, such as commentaries or journal articles.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The approach to this problem that I adopted and built upon was first suggested by
                    G. Crane [<a class="ref" href="#crane2009">Crane, Seales, and Terras 2009</a>] and consists of treating citations as a
                    special kind of named entities. There is a whole area of research in Computer
                    Science called Named Entity Recognition that deals with the automatic extraction
                    of mentions of, among others, people, places and organizations (i.e. named
                    entities). Capturing named entities implies also identifying the relations that
                    exist between them (relation extraction) and disambiguating entity mentions by
                    means of unique identifiers (named entity disambiguation).</div>

                        published in every part of the world on a wide variety of topics in the
                        Classics. Such a wide coverage makes the APh a fundamental bibliographic
                        resource and the starting point for virtually any study of classical
                        antiquity. However, this dataset covers only a very small portion of all the
                        APh data: it contains slightly less than 30,000 words of text originating
                        from 400 reviews that were drawn from a single volume out of the 80 volumes
                        published to date. The volume used to create this dataset — APh vol. 75 —
                        contains reviews of publications that appeared, or were reviewed, in

                        entities necessary to represent a range of canonical citations as wide as
                        possible. Although it is true that such citations tend to have a rather
                        homogeneous and somehow standardised format, the narrative within which they
                        are situated leads to a wide range of possible variations in their
                        structure. What can vary substantially, for example, is the position within
                        the sentence or the document that the components of a citation can take. The
                        solution to this was to represent such citations as relations between the
                        constituent components of a citation rather than as entities

                        This semi-automatic process led to the creation of a dataset suitable to

                        corpus. In order to do so a machine learning-based approach is employed,
                        meaning that a statistical model is trained to predict, for each token (i.e.
                        word) in the text, which label is to be assigned. During the training phase
                        the model learns from the previously annotated data which features

                        corresponds to a named entity. Once trained, the model is then able to
                        predict with some degree of accuracy the most likely labels for an unseen
                        input sequence — i.e. a sequence that is not already contained in the

                        how to perform a specific task based on a training set, in the rule-based
                        approach a set of rules is defined based on some observations of the data.
                        These rules take into account the position of named entities within the
                        sentence as well as their position within the broader context of the

                        this means replicating in a digital environment what canonical citations
                        have allowed scholars to already do in print, that is to create references
                        to texts that are fine-grained and at the same time independent from any

                        disambiguation is provided by mentions of author names such as
                            "Aristophanes" that can refer either to the Alexandrian grammar or
                        to the comic playwright: in similar cases the broader context of the
                        document needs to be considered in order to decide which author is being

                        only be disambiguated but also normalised: in the example above the scope
                            "6.851-853" is normalised into "6.851-6.853". Similarly, the
                        notation "6.851 s." — meaning book 6, line 851 and the following —
                        needs to be made explicit and transformed into "6.851-6.852". The
                        normalisation of citation scopes is also necessary because there are
                        multiple ways of expressing the same citation. The citation scope

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">The most challenging aspect of representing canonical citations as a formal
                        network is how to preserve the multiplicity of hierarchical levels that such
                        citations embody. For example, the reference Verg., <cite class="title italic">Aen.</cite> 6.851-853 can be regarded as: a) a reference to Vergil; b)
                        a reference to the <cite class="title italic">Aeneid</cite> and c) a reference to
                        lines 851-853 of book six of Vergil's <cite class="title italic">Aeneid</cite>.
                        Which level is to be taken into account depends from the context in which
                        the citation network is used. When studying intertextuality, for example,
                        one may want to consider intertextual relationships at the global level,
                        that is between the entire body of works of two (or more) authors, or at a
                        local level, meaning relationships between two (or more) specific works or
                        even single text passages.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">The approach I have taken to tackle this issue, inspired by a similar
                        approach developed by [<a class="ref" href="#schich2011">Schich and Coscia 2011</a>], is to create a
                        three-level network that allows us to look at the same citation data at
                        different levels of abstraction, namely macro-, meso- and micro-level.
                        Similar to how a lens works, these networks make it possible to produce a
                        number of views on the citation data with an increasing degree of
                        granularity and specificity. Each of these networks addresses a specific
                        hierarchical level of analysis and is therefore likely to be useful to
                        analyse and observe only certain phenomena.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">These networks are all two-mode (or bipartite) and directed networks.
                        Two-mode means that there are two types (or modes) of nodes in the network
                        and that, by definition, edges can exist only between nodes with different
                        modes. The definition of types, as I explain below, varies depending on the
                        network level being considered. Moreover, since citations themselves have a
                        directionality, that is from the citing document to the cited one, all three
                        networks are <em class="emph">directed</em>, meaning that the citations are
                        represented as edges going from the citing node to the cited one.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">The network visualisations that follow were created from the manually
                        corrected subset of the APh data, which consists of 366 documents — i.e. APh
                        reviews — for a total of approximately 25,000 tokens and 850 canonical
                        references. These visualisations use a force-layout algorithm to position
                        the nodes on the canvas. As its name suggests, this algorithm works by
                        applying different forces to each node in the network, namely repulsion,
                        gravity and attraction. All nodes push each other away (repulsion), whilst
                        connected nodes are pulled toward each other (attraction). Simultaneously,
                        gravity pushes all nodes towards the center so as to oppose the repulsion
                        and prevent the nodes from being pushed out of sight. The final
                        configuration of the nodes results from the interplay of these three forces
                        after several iterations of the algorithm. As a result, nodes that are
                        highly connected with each other tend to remain in the middle of the canvas,
                        whereas less connected nodes are pushed towards the periphery.</div>

                            However, since the networks on which the search is based are extracted
                            automatically from text, it becomes possible to search through
                            large-scale archives as if an index of all the text passages cited by
                            the documents contained in these archives had been compiled.</div>

                            document-document network, two documents are connected when they share
                            references to the same set of text passages. Such a network can be
                            exploited in order to identify clusters of publications that are likely
                            to be highly related to one another as they are concerned with the same

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">In this paper I presented an approach to creating citation networks by
                    automatically extracting canonical references to classical texts from modern
                    publications. A relatively small dataset consisting of reviews drawn from <cite class="title italic">L’Année Philologique</cite> was used to exemplify the
                    extraction of such references as well as the creation of a three-level citation
                    network that represents them. However, only the mining of these references on a
                    larger scale may realise the full potential of this approach both in terms of
                    user applications and of data analysis.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6542e888">[10]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Several kinds of user applications could be developed building upon the citation
                    networks that were described above. These applications include: <ol class="list"><li class="item">search applications;</li><li class="item">recommender systems for bibliography;</li><li class="item">enhanced reading environments.</li></ol></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Search applications would allow users to explore collections of publications
                    using citations to primary sources as a key entry point to bibliographic
                    information. In addition to searching by cited author and work, users would be
                    able to retrieve documents that cite a specific text passage. This functionality
                    is already provided, albeit on a smaller scale, by indexes of cited passages
                    which constitute a scholarly resource of essential importance. Moreover, the
                    fact that the relationships between texts are formalised as a network allows for
                    using the graph — in addition to the hierarchical index — as a visual metaphor
                    when designing the user interface for such a search application. In fact, the
                    graph seems an apt way of representing visually and making browsable the
                    connections between resources that are created by canonical references.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">Recommender systems for bibliography — an increasingly common feature of digital
                    libraries and reference management systems — often rely on the references
                    contained in a given article to suggest related publications to the reader.
                    While these systems take into consideration only references to other modern
                    publications, the approach I described allows us to develop similar applications
                    that leverage instead the references to classical texts. The cited primary
                    sources become, in other words, the criterion to determine the relatedness
                    between publications. The three-level network presented in the last section —
                    and especially the document-document networks that can be projected at any level
                    of the network — provide the citation data to which clustering algorithms could
                    be applied in order to extract clusters of related publications.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Finally, canonical citations extracted from journal articles and other secondary
                    sources can be employed within digital reading environments for primary sources
                    so as to contextualise the text passage being read. This use of the citation
                    data was explored within the Hellespont project [<a class="ref" href="#romanello2012">Romanello and Thomas 2012</a>].
                    One of the outcomes of this project is an online environment to read the text of
                    Thucydides' "Pentecontaetia" (Thuc. 1.89-118).<a class="noteRef" href="#d6542e919">[11]</a>
                    Such a reading environment presents to the user various layers of annotations
                    with which the Greek text has been enriched. Additionally, a dedicated panel of
                    the interface displays a list of articles contained in JSTOR that refer to the
                    passage currently being read (see <a href="#figure07">fig. 7</a>).<a class="noteRef" href="#d6542e928">[12]</a> To make this possible, canonical
                    references to the "Pentecontaetia" were automatically
                    mined from a sample of classics articles from JSTOR.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">In addition to enabling the possible uses outlined above, the research presented
                    here opens up new areas for further research. A first area concerns the design
                    of a user interface that allows classicists to explore in an intuitive way
                    collections of publications through this three-level citation network. Such an
                    interface should enable the user to move back and forth between the different
                    levels of analysis and to follow chains of citations within the network. A
                    second area of research is constituted by the longitudinal study of this
                    network, which looks at how the network evolves over time. This aspect was not
                    considered in this paper as the APh reviews in the corpus cover only articles
                    that were published or reviewed within a single year. On the contrary, a
                    resource such as JSTOR would be ideally suited for this kind of analysis as it
                    contains thousands of articles spanning across more than two centuries. Having
                    at hand citation data covering a wider period of time has the potential to
                    enable new approaches to the study of text reception in Classics. It will become
                    possible, for example, to observe trends in the way ancient authors, works and
                    even single text passages were objects of attention by scholars over time.</div>
