                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In the 1980s, a classical scholar might have been forgiven for considering
                    digital approaches ancillary. The pioneering projects of the Perseus Digital
                    Library and the Packard Humanities Institute might have seemed to simply provide
                    existing texts in a more accessible form. By now, however, it has become clear
                    that digital methods are transforming how we understand classical antiquity. At
                    the same time that Google Books and the Hathi Trust and related efforts have
                    made the content of millions of books instantly available on the internet to the
                    public and scholars alike, electronic databases and journals like this one have
                    opened new horizons by removing impediments of access. As with the study of the
                    humanities as a whole, so within the field of Classics, new and enhanced tools
                    continue to come online to facilitate existing modes of teaching and research
                    and provide new ones. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">These efforts are still new enough, however, that the field has not yet fully
                    adapted to make them easily accessible. Classicists could once keep current by
                    reviewing the latest journals and reviews, visiting conference bookstands, and
                    leafing through publisher catalogues. But how would one expect to learn about,
                    say, the <a class="ref" href="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/lofts/" onclick="window.open('http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/lofts/'); return false">LOFTS</a>
                    project for the digitization and analysis of fragmentary ancient texts? Peer
                    review of digital resources exists in some areas of humanities, such as <a class="ref" href="http://www.modnets.org/about/peer_review/" onclick="window.open('http://www.modnets.org/about/peer_review/'); return false">Modnets</a> for
                    American modernist literary and cultural studies, but not as yet in
                        Classics.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6201e209">[1]</a> There are other good
                    starting points, such as the <a class="ref" href="http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Category:Projects" onclick="window.open('http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Category:Projects'); return false">list of digital
                        projects</a> provided by digitalclassicist.org and the announcements and
                    conversations on the digitalclassicist <a class="ref" href="http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Discussion" onclick="window.open('http://wiki.digitalclassicist.org/Discussion'); return false">listserv</a>.
                    Digitalclassicist.org has also helped organize a series of <a class="ref" href="http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/index.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/index.html'); return false">seminars</a> in
                    Berlin, Boston, Göttingen, and London. As elsewhere in the digital humanities,
                    blogs and Twitter feeds serve as other important channels for sharing
                    information. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Despite the existence of these fora, there has remained a need to bring digital
                    classicists together to share techniques and results, and to connect them with a
                    broader audience of scholars and educators. The <a class="ref" href="http://dca.drupalgardens.com/" onclick="window.open('http://dca.drupalgardens.com/'); return false">Digital Classics Association</a>
                    (DCA) was created in 2013 in order to advance these aims, primarily in the
                    United States, which, despite the ongoing work of Perseus and others, has
                    nevertheless lagged behind Europe in conversations around digital classics. To
                    help bring these to a wider classics audience, the DCA has organized a series of
                    panels at the largest gathering of classicists in the world, the annual joint
                    meetings of the <a class="ref" href="https://www.archaeological.org" onclick="window.open('https://www.archaeological.org'); return false">Archaeological
                        Institute of America</a> and the <a class="ref" href="https://classicalstudies.org" onclick="window.open('https://classicalstudies.org'); return false">Society for Classical Studies</a>.
                    As a contribution to the dialogue among those with digital interests and skills,
                    it also staged a standalone conference at the State University of New York at
                    Buffalo in spring 2013, "<a class="ref" href="http://classics.buffalo.edu/events/dcaconference/" onclick="window.open('http://classics.buffalo.edu/events/dcaconference/'); return false">Word, Space,
                            Time: Digital Perspectives on the Classical World</a>," with
                    presentations on a variety of areas within the study of classical antiquity.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The conference was meant to be maximally inclusive, as indicated by its title:
                        "Word" stood for texts generally, "Space" for material culture and
                    place, and "Time" for historical studies. The ecumenical approach meant
                    foregoing the benefit of drawing together experts in one sub-field prepared to
                    fully critique one another’s work. It was designed rather to take advantage of
                    the inherent interdisciplinarity of digital work and create a forum for
                    conversations across the sub-fields of classics and beyond. The conference
                    provided a snapshot of important work along this spectrum, which, given the
                    emerging and ongoing nature of many digital projects, often meant
                    work-in-progress.</div>

                        represent some of the major lines of approach current within the areas of
                        digital classics.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6201e263">[2]</a> The most fundamental effort is to
                        continue the work begun by Perseus and PHI in the 1980s of digitizing
                        materials for reading and analysis. As part of its larger goals, the <a class="ref" href="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/open-philology-project/" onclick="window.open('http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/open-philology-project/'); return false">Open

                        corpus of Greek and Latin. Complementary efforts are beginning under the
                        auspices of the Society for Classical Studies, the Medieval Academy of
                        America, and the Renaissance Society of America, for the construction of a

                            Library</a>.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6201e279">[3]</a> More specialized efforts have
                        made considerable progress digitizing texts from beyond the classical era,
                        including <a class="ref" href="http://digiliblt.lett.unipmn.it/index.php?lang=en" onclick="window.open('http://digiliblt.lett.unipmn.it/index.php?lang=en'); return false">DigilibLT</a>, which hosts many late antique Latin texts, and <a class="ref" href="http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenahtdocs/camena_e.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camenahtdocs/camena_e.html'); return false">Camena</a>, which has a Neo-Latin collection. Among parallel efforts
                        to digitize primary materials in the realm of material culture, a notable
                        effort is <a class="ref" href="http://www.fastionline.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.fastionline.org/'); return false">FASTI</a>, a site that
                        aggregates the records from excavation and conservation of classical

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Two of the articles in this volume report on ongoing efforts to expand the
                        fundamental materials available online. They also illustrate how these
                        efforts often follow in the footsteps of Perseus in creating a rich set of
                        tools with which to analyze the materials they have digitized. The first of
                        these efforts is in fact an effort under the umbrella of the Open Philology
                        project, the Leipzig Open Fragmentary Texts Series (<a class="ref" href="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/lofts/" onclick="window.open('http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/lofts/'); return false">LOFTS</a>). In their
                        contribution, Monica Berti, Bridget Almas, and Gregory Crane explain how
                        LOFTS approaches digitizing several sets of classical texts consisting
                        wholly or partly of fragments or quotations.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The first challenge lies in the selection of texts to digitize. Classicists
                        have the advantage that the editions of their primary texts, and even some
                        secondary texts, are often old enough to be free of copyright restrictions.
                        Among the digital editions LOFTS is producing is one the <cite class="title italic">Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</cite> (<cite class="title italic">Fragments of Greek Historians</cite>, or <cite class="title italic">FHG</cite>) of Karl Müller. The volumes of <cite class="title italic">FHG</cite> were published from 1841 to 1870, and became
                        the basis of the authoritative print edition of Felix Jacoby, <a class="ref" href="http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/dfhg/" onclick="window.open('http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/dfhg/'); return false">Die Fragmente der
                            griechischen Historiker</a>, whose first volume appeared in 1923, and
                        which has been continued now in online subscription format as <a class="ref" href="http://www.brill.com/publications/online-resources/jacoby-online" onclick="window.open('http://www.brill.com/publications/online-resources/jacoby-online'); return false">Jacoby Online</a>. The choice to digitize Müller’s earlier <cite class="title italic">FHG</cite> was partly by necessity, since some if not all
                        of Jacoby is under copyright, and so not available for an open access
                        edition. This sort of situation is faced by many digital classics efforts.
                        Classicists may have full and free use of editions of most texts, just not
                        the most recent editions. As part of the Open Philology project, the leaders
                        of LOFTS have developed a best-practices strategy for confronting this
                        problem, which includes signalling differences from more recent editions.
                        Also, earlier editions, even when superseded in some respects, often have
                        virtues that later editions do not. The <cite class="title italic">FHG</cite>,
                        for example, is more concise and manageable than Jacoby’s more comprehensive
                        work.</div>

                        effort at digitization, but one that confronts its own distinct challenges.
                        The goal of their Coptic Scriptorium project is to develop a digital corpus
                        of Coptic texts. Coptic is the form of the ancient Egyptian language that
                        emerged in the Roman period, with a largely Greek alphabet used for grammar
                        and vocabulary evolved from ancient Egyptian. Critical as they are for the
                        understanding of late Egyptian culture, as well as the contemporary cultures
                        of Greece and Rome, many Coptic texts have never been edited and published
                        at all, much less in digital form. The project they describe thus takes as
                        its starting point the creation of a collaborative publication and editing
                        space for presenting these texts.</div>

                        for example, the fact that the Mediterranean is characterized as a more wild
                        and adventuresome place, described with words coming under the themes of
                            "Outlaws and Robbers,"
                        "Female Heroines,"

                        Jerusalem, which are associated with more sublime themes like "Art and

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">Traditional philological studies have also been transformed by the new
                        digital tools. Neil W. Bernstein described a method for gauging the internal
                        connectedness, through allusion and intertext, of the works that make up the
                        corpus of classical Latin epic poetry. Bernstein and his collaborators took
                        the individual, often subtle borrowings of language from one epic author to
                        another revealed by the search provided by the <a class="ref" href="http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/" onclick="window.open('http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu/'); return false">Tesserae Project web
                            tool</a>. They conducted a rigorous, large-scale study that compares
                        the overall level of intertextuality among authors writing epic.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6201e538">[5]</a> The result was a relatively
                        objective measure of which authors were most influential in the tradition,
                        and which on the other hand were most interested in alluding to and
                        borrowing from the language of their predecessors and contemporaries. The
                        result is a kind of genealogy of influence that was impossible to conduct
                        before the advent of digital tools. </div>

                        interdisciplinarity of classical studies, which has traditionally integrated
                        the study of literary and archaeological sources. So whereas the notion of
                            "big tent" digital humanities, including not just
                        developers but users and others, has had to be argued for in the broader
                        field of digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#gold2012">Gold 2012</a>], particpants in the
                        2013 DCA conference demonstrated a strong sense of common purpose in
                        developing technologies and adapting them for particular ends. The
                        continuing development of large-scale digital infrastructure in classics
                        described above should provide an improved common basis for such efforts,
                        allowing for increased collaboration around existing tools and data
                        archives, and so easier creation and dissemination of new analytical and
                        pedagogical applications.</div>
