            <div id="abstract"><h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p> Early modern printed books pose particular challenges for automatic
                    transcription: uneven inking, irregular orthographies, radically multilingual
                    texts. As a result, modern efforts to transcribe these documents tend to produce
                    the textual gibberish commonly known as "dirty OCR" (Optical Character
                    Recognition). This noisy output is most frequently seen as a barrier to access
                    for scholars interested in the computational analysis or digital display of
                    transcribed documents. This article, however, proposes that a closer analysis of
                    dirty OCR can reveal both historical and cultural factors at play in the
                    practice of automatic transcription. To make this argument, it focuses on tools
                    developed for the automatic transcription of the <cite class="title italic">Primeros
                        Libros</cite> collection of sixteenth century Mexican printed books. By
                    bringing together the history of the collection with that of the OCR tool, it
                    illustrates how the colonial history of these documents is embedded in, and
                    transformed by, the statistical models used for automatic transcription. It
                    argues that automatic transcription, itself a mechanical and practical tool,
                    also has an interpretive effect on transcribed texts that can have practical
                    consequences for scholarly work.</p>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a ubiquitous element of intellectual
                    life online. Whether we are reading scanned documents behind a paywall, beyond
                    copyright limits, or from sites of semi-illegal textual redistribution, we have
                    all encountered these highly flawed efforts to transform the printed word into
                    machine-readable type. Defined on Wikipedia as "the
                        mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typewritten or printed text
                        into machine-encoded text," OCR works by identifying a correspondence
                    between printed characters and their UTI-encoded digital equivalents [<a class="ref" href="#wikipedia2015">“Optical Character Recognition” 2015</a>]. Described metaphorically as the process of
                    machine-reading the printed page, what OCR achieves is the conversion of an
                    image into data that can be processed computationally. It is thus a technology
                    located at the intersection between material and digital text. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">"Dirty OCR" is the name given to OCR output that features non-linguistic
                    characters or gibberish transcriptions. <a href="#table01">Table 1</a>
                    shows examples of dirty OCR that reflect various material conditions (the
                        "noisiness") of the original image. In one example, a
                    poorly aligned scan has distorted the characters beyond recognition. In another
                    case, shadows on a blank page are re-interpreted as characters by the
                    over-optimistic machine reader. In a third example, a decorative image is
                    misinterpreted as language and encoded as nonsense. Each of these examples
                    reflects the machine's inadequate understanding of the relationship between text
                    and object. Other examples, some of which will be addressed later, reflect the
                    machine's inadequate understanding of language. <div id="table01" class="table"><table class="table"><tr class="row">

                    everything from word searches to measures of word frequency, collocation, or
                    sentiment analysis. Elizabeth Lorang and Brian Pytlik describe many of these
                    concerns in their article about the electronic text analysis of newspapers. They
                    considered using OCR output for their study, but found that "The issues of OCR accuracy and a lack of disclosure about accuracy
                        rates" made these sources untenable, prompting them to limit their
                    study to double-keyed manual transcriptions [<a class="ref" href="#lorang2012">Lorang 2012</a>, 307]. For those who stick with dirty transcriptions, there are other consequences,
                    as both Maciej Eder and Matt Jockers have discussed. In his 2012 study of
                    systematic corpus errors, Eder tested an authorship attribution tool on corpora
                    with varying degrees of transcription accuracy. He found that as long as error
                    rates remained under 20 percent, they did not affect the success rates of the
                    attribution tool. This suggests that large-scale corpus analysis can handle
                    large degrees of error [<a class="ref" href="#eder2012">Eder 2012</a>]. Extending this claim, Matt
                    Jockers has suggested that perhaps manually-corrected OCR, though not perfect,
                    is "good enough" for stylometric analysis,
                    hypothesizing that "at the large scale these OCR issues become
                            trivial"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2014">Jockers 2014</a>, 10.1]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Eders and Jockers both work with literary corpora cleaned of problematic pages
                    like the ones displayed above; given the size of their corpora and the
                    specificity of their research queries, dirty OCR may in fact be adequate for
                    their purposes. It's worth noting, however, that the simulations of dirty OCR
                    used by Eder and Jockers assume that character errors are randomly distributed
                    across a corpus. Eder’s claims may not hold up if there are, in fact, patterns
                    in OCR error distribution. As Jockers himself remarks wistfully, the
                        "good-enough" hypothesis may be wishful thinking. OCR
                    errors may impact corpus analytics more than we like to admit. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Dirty OCR can also affect other kinds of reading. A student searching for the
                    location of a quote, a scholar looking for the presence of a word, or a family
                    member looking for reference to an ancestor might be stymied by bad OCR. A

                    language of Chimalpahin, as evidence of the paucity of good Nahuatl
                    transcriptions. A few minutes of collation reveal that the gibberish is not
                    actually a transcription of the Nahuatl text, but rather the misrepresentation
                    of a linguistic table inserted vertically into the French introduction,
                    incorrectly rendered by the machine as horizontal text. As in a similarly
                    illegible example from a digitized page of the <cite class="title italic">New York

                    scholarship focused specifically on the role of scribes, notaries, and other

                    often overlooked in favor of single authors, whose names and influence are

                    predominant narratives continue to treat the technologies themselves as

                    of textual accessibility and utility. Yet as Peter Robinson and Elizabeth
                    Solopova write, "[T]ranscription of a primary textual source
                        cannot be regarded as an act of substitution, but as a series of acts of
                        translation from one semiotic system (that of the primary source) to another
                        semiotic system (that of the computer). Like all acts of translation, it
                        must be seen as fundamentally incomplete and fundamentally
                        interpretative" (quoted in [<a class="ref" href="#robinson2013">Robinson 2013</a>, 120–121]). The relationship between semiotic systems, however, is never equal;
                    instead, it is hierarchical and shaped by the social conditions of its
                    production. Automatic transcription, itself a mechanical and practical tool,

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The presence of a methodology section in this essay is an acknowledgement of two
                    major theoretical influences that inform it: digital humanities and decolonial
                    studies. First, within the loosely defined discipline of digital humanities, the
                    divergence of approaches to the studies of culture and technology has led to a
                    renewed attention to method. This is compounded by the influence of scholars in
                    the sciences, for whom method is integral to written scholarship, and by the
                    increasing attention to quantitative analysis, the proper evaluation of which
                    depends on a clear articulation of methods and results. In part because the
                    field of digital humanities is defined by neither its methods nor its objects of
                    study, it has become necessary for each project to inscribe its own borders and
                    direction within the field.</div>

                    of close (or "scalable") reading are brought to bear on
                    transcribed texts. As Wolfgang Ernst writes, media archaeology calls for "an awareness of moments when media themselves, not
                            exclusively humans anymore, become active ‘archaeologists’ of
                            knowledge"

                    transcription (the sequential replication of previously existing words) is
                    belied by the mechanics of transcribing. </div>

                            understanding the complex ways in which the pursuit of knowledge is
                            deeply embedded in the multiple layers of imperial and colonial

                    delineation of a project’s scope and a point of access for evaluators, in
                    decolonial studies methodology is an articulation of a project’s complicity
                    with, or resistance to, colonial discourse. </div>

                    transcription systems or affected by OCR algorithms. This approach is inspired
                    by the #DHPOCO movement spearheaded by Roopika Risam and Adeline Koh, which "brings critiques of colonialism, imperialism, and

                    the relationship between the colonial status of sixteenth-century transcription
                    practices and those of the twenty-first century. By bringing together content

                        alphabetic writing to indigenous American communities functioned as a
                        linguistic conquest that paralleled other kinds of colonization, based on
                        the presumed superiority of Latin grammatical structures [<a class="ref" href="#mignolo1995">Mignolo 1995</a>]. In contrast, Rincón was unique in seeing
                        Nahuatl as different from Latin, rather than deficient, suggesting that the
                        language called for new grammatical models. "The
                            alphabetic representation of the languages," McDonough observes, "can indeed be seen as suppression or even an
                                attempted destruction of one technology and the imposition of
                                another. At the same time, Nahua appropriation of the alphabetic
                                script, and of the Latin and Castilian languages, was just as much a

                        printed using a hand press.<a class="noteRef" href="#d5774e607">[7]</a> By taking
                        into account the unique material factors affecting transcription of these
                        printed books, Ocular improves significantly on tools that expect the
                        stylistic consistency of modern printed books. Ocular works by combining two
                        generative statistical models that represent how text should be. The first
                        model, which is called the "font model," focuses on the material
                        qualities of the text: the shape of the font, the alignment of the type, the
                        over- or under-inking that make text difficult to read visually. The second
                        model, which is called the "language model," focuses on the text
                        itself. After analyzing a language sample, it builds a statistical model of
                        six-character strings (known as six-grams): given any sequence of five
                        characters, it is able to guess at what the sixth character should be. The
                        result of this combination is a model that can identify clearly defined
                        characters and use context to recognize an unclear image [<a class="ref" href="#berg-kirkpatrick2013">Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. 2013</a>]. </div>

                        found that equal attention to the language model is necessary for a fully
                        functioning OCR system. Ocular was originally designed for a
                        nineteenth-century British corpus which was relatively monolingual and
                        orthographically regular. In our sixteenth-century corpus, monolingual
                        documents were not guaranteed: texts switch between languages at the level
                        of the chapter, paragraph, sentence, and even word. This is illustrated, for
                        example, in a passage from Rincón’s <cite class="title italic">Arte

                    United States registered the first patents for machine readers for the blind.
                    Like many other histories of technology, these stories situate early machine
                    reading within a narrative of nineteenth-century national identity construction
                    in which blind citizens are brought into civic life with the aid of new
                    technologies. They also provide validation for automatic transcription based on
                    what Mara Mills, in her important work on OCR, describes as the "assistive pretext" of OCR: the claim that automatic
                    transcription is a tool used primarily to increase the accessibility of printed
                    documents, especially for blind readers [<a class="ref" href="#mills2013">Mills 2013</a>]

                    globalization and neoliberalism to explain how OCR shifted from being a tool for
                    aiding individual readers to become a tool for the facilitation of institutional
                    data processing. Interestingly, this institutional present of automatic
                    transcription is often described as one that is independent of identity,
                    culture, nation, and language. Even when scholars are critical of what they see
                    as the neoliberal implications of big data, they often describe it as a total
                    rupture with historical forms of engaging (as humans and machines) with text. In
                    contrast, when OCR is written into a longer history of transcription practices
                    that extends into the medieval era, it becomes possible to understand how it
                    engages with the practice of scribal correction, translation, and composition. </div>

                    scribes, the figures responsible for replicating these texts, have long held
                    influence over their form. The vast scholarship on textual criticism of the New
                    Testament bears witness to this history, as does the study of scribal culture
                    and its influence on the transmission of the literature and archival documents
                    of antiquity [<a class="ref" href="#ehrman2012">Ehrman 2012</a>]. Though one concern of these studies
                    has been the identification of authorial or biblical truth, other studies have
                    focused more on scribal influence over historical texts. To cite just one
                    example, a recent study on scribal copying in medieval England has shown how
                    copyists also worked to correct texts at an orthographic, aesthetic, and
                    semiotic level that has been described as akin to philology or literary
                    criticism [<a class="ref" href="#wakelin2014">Wakelin 2014</a>, 3–4].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">Some of this practice was carried into early colonial Spain, where indigenous
                    students were given transcription duties as part of their religious educations.
                    This labor of transcription also involved varying levels of interpretation and
                    translation in all cases, particularly when these students brought their
                    knowledge of indigenous practices, beliefs, and language use to the texts for
                    which they were responsible. Such is the case, famously, of the Nahua assistants
                    who worked with the Franciscan Fray Bernardino de Sahagún, often described as
                    the father of modern anthropology. Sahagún’s assistants, students at the Colegio
                    de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, were responsible for transcribing oral testimony
                    into alphabetic text; for copying (and providing alphabetic glosses of)
                    pictorial documents; and for translating Christian texts into Nahuatl. As Ellen
                    Baird has written in the case of the pictorial transcriptions, "The artists’ own history and their life in the present
                            (as well as Sahagún’s) shaped their conception of the past and the

                    documents, however, are produced through computer-aided processing. This might
                    suggest that the labor of transcription has become, at least in part, computer
                    labor, and that the artificially intelligent computer may be in some ways

                    history. Scholars in the humanities – and PDF users more generally – are
                    familiar with OCR primarily as a transcription tool. Yet transcription has not
                    been the primary purpose of OCR since the 1950s, when large institutions and
                    corporations first became interested in making their data – addresses on
                    envelopes, accounts payable and receivable – available for computer processing.
                    This required the conversion of paper records to machine-readable files. At this
                    point, the task of "transcribing" a text disappears entirely
                    from the narrative. In its place we find the deconstruction of an image into its

                    transcribed texts. In contrast, I argue that this shift in the relationship
                    between transcriber and text requires us to shift the focus of our attention as
                    we seek evidence of the transcriber’s hand (metaphorically speaking) in the
                    final transcription. First, it means that, like the machine reader, we must work
                    at the level of the character string, rather than the word or the sentence, to
                    identify sites of interaction between a transcription and the historical moment
                    of its production. Second, it means that alongside the transcription, we can
                    turn to the processing apparatus itself to identify further interventions in the
                    text produced by the machine. As Ocular processes facsimiles, it gathers
                    extensive information about every pixel – and every character – on the page.
                    This supplementary information, not unexpectedly, becomes central to the
                    processing potential of the tool, and to the interpretive interventions made to
                    the printed page.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">How does OCR shape transcriptions? I have argued that Ocular intervenes in the
                    printed text in two ways. Ocular’s "recognition" of printed
                    characters directly impacts the final output. At the same time, the processes
                    through which Ocular recognizes characters create supplementary information that
                    alters the meaning of the text. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36"> This section is concerned with the first intervention: the ways that the Ocular
                    system "recognizes" printed characters and how that
                    recognition can have an interpretive effect on the final transcription. I show
                    first how the dangers of transcription that are present in the colonial context
                    (the composite author-figure of the contact zone) insinuate themselves into
                    Ocular by way of the language data. Second, I consider how the Ocular system and
                    our evaluation methods are biased towards certain kinds of machine reading.
                    Here, I seek to show that the system itself has a deterministic effect not just
                    on the success of the machine reading, but also on its form. This impact, again,
                    is shaped by the context of the system’s use.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">Importantly, the goal in this section is not to prove machine-learning systems
                    like Ocular aren’t neutral. As recent reports in popular media about "biased algorithms" have shown, this is already a
                    well-established truth [<a class="ref" href="#angwin2016">Angwin et al. 2016</a>]

                    affect our transcription of the <cite class="title italic">Primeros Libros</cite>,

                        described, the colonial effort to reframe Nahuatl as a Latin language has
                        been understood as a process that both enacted and recorded broader
                        processes of cultural exchange and (forced) assimilation in early colonial
                        Mexico. We see this embedded in the very texts themselves, as shown by the
                        example of Rincón’s creative reworking of Latin grammatical law, or in
                        Bautista’s efforts to translate theologically precise concepts and texts
                        into Nahuatl. The differences can be expressed, importantly, at the level of
                        orthography: for example, the presence or absence of the letter "h",
                        used by some philologists to mark the glottal stop, may reflect different
                        understandings of the language that are shaped by efforts to adhere to – or
                        sway from – the Latin model [<a class="ref" href="#lockhart2001">Lockhart 2001</a>, 104]. </div>

                        Bautista’s <cite class="title italic">Advertencias</cite> discusses efforts to
                        communicate the concept of the holy trinity to new indigenous converts. The
                        danger is that the converts will understand the trinity – meant to be three
                        facets of a single god – as polytheistic. The solution, Bautista informs us,
                        is to use the Nahuatl phrase <span class="hi italic">Ca huel imeixtintzitzin</span>,
                        which signifies "<span class="hi italic">todas tres personas son el
                                verdadero</span>" (all three people are the true [god] [<a class="ref" href="#bautista1600">Bautista 1600</a>, 52r]). As Bautista describes, however,
                        embedded in this Nahuatl phrase is an <span class="foreign i">amphibologia</span> (amphibology: a grammatically ambiguous phrase)
                        which might lead the uninformed to the heretical belief that God is a
                        person. Bautista explains: "<span class="foreign i">Eſta
                                ãphibologia no ay ẽ latin, por ſer diferẽte la
                            terminacion</span>" ("This amphibology does not exist in Latin because
                                the ending [of the word] is different"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#bautista1600">Bautista 1600</a>, 52r]). This is Bautista’s paradox: without properly explaining the concept
                        of the holy trinity, new converts will believe Christianity is polytheistic.
                        Yet due to a grammatical difference between Latin and Nahuatl, efforts to
                        explain the concept lead, themselves, to the risk of heresy.</div>

                        the original text that looks like gibberish. A closer examination, however,
                        shows that there are patterns. Each variation is a reworking of Spanish and
                        of Nahuatl that reflects the linguistic biases of the original. Ocular works
                        by pairing a "font model" based on the visual appearance
                        of the characters with a "language model" based on its
                        knowledge of what language is supposed to look like. In these examples, the
                            "font model" pulls the transcription towards the
                        visual appearance of the text, while the language model pulls it towards the

                        that the language data has a direct effect on the transcription. This is
                        true even in the multilingual, early modern corpus that we used for our
                        transcriptions. Given the wide variations in orthographic norms among
                        regions and writers and the sparsity of language data relative to the
                        requirements of the language model, it was impossible to build a language
                        corpus that perfectly represented the context of our documents. Instead, our
                        language data is more generalized, which has a homogenizing effect on
                        regional variations. This homogenization is complicated by the fact that
                        many of the transcriptions we used for our data are modernized versions of
                        historical documents. Modifications of spelling, extension of shorthand, and
                        standardization of character use are respected practices among documentary
                        editors working to produce readable documents for a (relatively) general
                        public. When they are embedded into the language data, however, they become
                        unrecognized influences over the shape of the final text. </div>

                        Because alphabetic Nahuatl was still under development during the sixteenth
                        century, orthographic difference can be an important marker of regional,
                        religious, authorial, or class distinctions. Our language data for Nahuatl
                        came primarily from scholars schooled in the orthographic tradition promoted
                        by James Lockhart. This tradition, based on that developed by the
                        seventeenth century philologist Horacio Carochi, was primarily documentary:
                        it sought to reflect the styles of the original documents [<a class="ref" href="#lockhart2001">Lockhart 2001</a>, 109]. Modernization nevertheless occurred,
                        as in the transcription of an unrenderable shorthand as "qz," or the
                        general adherence to standards that didn’t "jelly" (to use Lockhart’s term) until the 1560s or 70s, some
                        thirty years into the <cite class="title italic">Primeros Libros</cite> corpus. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">In this case, the decision to draw on Lockhart’s documentation in our
                        transcriptions was a conscious decision to bias the model towards these
                        orthographic standards. Perhaps more significantly, however, the Lockhart
                        examples often came from the legal archives, which had spelling conventions
                        that often differed significantly from their ecclesiastical counterparts. As
                        Lockhart writes, "when left to themselves […] Nahua writers had a
                                very different outlook on what they were doing than their Spanish
                                counterparts. Spaniards were spelling words; in general, they wrote
                                a given word the same way every time they used it, employing the
                                same standard spelling, in relative independence of how they might
                                pronounce it. To the Nahuas, the word, insofar as they were even
                                aware of it, was a constantly changing entity with fluid
                                borders"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#lockhart2001">Lockhart 2001</a>, 111]. This could be represented by a difference in spacing, but could also
                        appear in the form of phonetic spelling variations. It was also reflected at
                        the level of the letter, through the presence and absence of the glottal
                        stop as "h" and the "n" or "m" to signify nasal sounds. To
                        impose this orthographic pattern onto the <cite class="title italic">Primeros
                            Libros</cite> documents, which were primarily ecclesiastical, is to
                        erase important cultural differences between two forms of Nahuatl writing.
                        Yet given the paucity of the Nahuatl corpus, distinguishing between the
                        various forms of Nahuatl was not a real option. </div>

                        trapped linguistically between two heresies: the heresy of polytheism or the
                        heresy of deistic personhood. Though the orthographic variations in Ocular’s
                        language data may not appear to carry the same theological weight, they do
                        mark epistemological differences, the erasure of which may, among certain
                        circles, come dangerously close to heresy. If we return to the scene of
                        textual production, we recall that these texts are the products of
                        relationships between the friars – Spanish and criollo – and the indigenous
                        scribes. Orthographic homogenization can also present itself as the erasure
                        of already-obscured indigenous voices, or of the growing influence of
                        Spanish epistemologies. Both of these factors are consequential for our

                        between the font model and the language model, which work in tandem to
                        recognize characters. It is also present in the evaluation system that we

                        by choosing the right texts for the language model. When human transcribers
                        decide to replace an "x" with the more modern "j" in words like
                            <span class="hi italic">dixe</span> (modern Spanish <span class="foreign i">dije,</span>

                        relationship between the two characters. In contrast, when the system
                        encounters <span class="hi italic">dixe</span>, the visual data from the font model
                        makes the letter "j" highly improbable as a substitute. Instead, if the

                        Nahuatl decisions based on his knowledge of Spanish and Latin. As a result,
                        the evaluative system encouraged an output in which the Nahuatl looked more
                        like a Romance language.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55">This effect is compounded when we consider the history of the Nahuatl
                        documents themselves. As described previously, for the early Spanish
                        linguists, Nahuatl’s value as a language was measured against a Latin
                        standard, such that one Franciscan was able to remark "the Mexican language lacks seven letters"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#mignolo1995">Mignolo 1995</a>, 46]. For these early linguists, this lack articulated not just the
                        paucity of the language, but by association, the weakness of the culture
                        which produced it. At the same time, the imposition of Latin grammar,
                        orthography, and textual ideology onto Nahuatl culture was itself a
                        reframing of the relationship among speaker, language, and text which would
                        have epistemological consequences. When these linguistic relations are
                        duplicated by the Ocular evaluation system, the colonial legacy of the
                        documents is again embedded in the system’s output.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p56">In the prior section, I showed how the automatic transcriptions produced by the
                    Ocular system are shaped by biases in the system and the language data. In my
                    description of the history of OCR, however, I suggested that the automatic
                    transcription output by an OCR system is merely a byproduct of the textual
                    processing at the heart of the work that Optical Character Recognition does. To
                    conclude this article, I want to point to some ways that recentering our
                    understanding of OCR away from the transcription can open new doors for textual
                    analysis that go beyond the re-inscription of cultural hierarchies into digital
                    copies of colonial texts.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p57">57</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p57"> Ocular produces a statistical analysis of each character in the digital
                    facsimile of a historical document, analyzing color saturation, character
                    alignment, textual context, and language. Ocular conducts this analysis in order
                    to "recognize" each character by predicting its most likely
                    textual correspondent. If we reorient away from character recognition, however,
                    we find a wealth of data about the original facsimile. This data can open new
                    doors for textual analysis. For example, Ocular’s font model has a statistical
                    understanding of the font used by a given document that could provide insight
                    into the circulation of fonts, or provide key evidence for printer attribution
                    in the case of an ambiguous document. The font model also identifies patterns in
                    inking and character variation that might enable us to identify the order in
                    which copies were printed. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">The language model gathers important analytic data as well. Consider for example
                    the language tagging that is implicit in our multilingual enhancement of the
                    original Ocular system. We modified Ocular by asking it to identify the language
                    of each word in a document before drawing on the appropriate language model for
                    character recognition. Given the three language options in our corpus (Spanish,
                    Latin, and Nahuatl), the system makes a best guess for every word as it
                    transcribes it, and then uses that guess to improve the transcription. By
                    preserving that language choice, we end up with a representation of language
                    distribution across the document. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p59">59</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p59">There are several ways that language tagging can open new interpretive
                    possibilities for future analysis. This data makes it easy to filter the
                    thousands of pages in our corpus to focus on a particular language. It also
                    makes it possible to track patterns of multilingual expression throughout the
                    corpus. Furthermore, language tagging can have important downstream consequences
                    for scholars interested in natural language processing. Piotrowski describes how
                    multilingual documents pose problems for future analysis, like part-of-speech
                    tagging, lemmatization, morphological analysis, and syntactic parsing, because
                    each of these forms of analysis expects a monolingual corpus [<a class="ref" href="#piotrowski2012">Piotrowski 2012</a>]. Multilingual tagging may enable separation of
                    the corpus for these monolingual forms of analysis. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p60">60</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p60">At the same time, errors in language tagging reveal how these analytic approaches
                    carry their own colonial dangers. Errors in language tagging frequently occur in
                    the Rincón transcription, which often intersperses Nahuatl prefixes, suffixes,
                    and other elements of word use into Spanish descriptions of grammatical
                    patterns. Here the brevity of the word fragments (two or three letters) doesn’t
                    provide enough information to trigger a language shift in the system. More
                    interesting for our purposes, however, are errors like those in Figure 2, which
                    shows a fragment from the <cite class="title italic">Advertencias</cite> that
                    continues the discussion of the holy trinity described above. Here we see that
                    the Spanish word <span class="foreign i">Dios</span>, which appears twice in
                    the fragment, has been identified first as Spanish, then as Nahuatl. Elsewhere
                    on the same page, the Latin words <span class="foreign i">Sancto</span> and
                        <span class="foreign i">Sanctisima</span> were incorrectly tagged as
                    Nahuatl. In both cases, the incorrect tagging is likely triggered by the
                    frequent presence of loanwords in the Nahuatl, Spanish, and Latin training
                    corpus. Though the <cite class="title italic">Primeros Libros</cite> may be an
                    exaggerated case, early modern writers were almost all multilingual, and early
                    modern writing frequently switches between Latin and the vernacular, using Latin
                    words to emphasize or highlight key terms in much the same way that Spaniards
                    writing in Nahuatl (or their Nahua assistants) drop in terms like <span class="foreign i">Sancto</span> (holy) or <span class="foreign i">Dios</span> (god). </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">The accurate tagging of loan words poses a particular problem when there is a
                    mismatch between our language data and the text being transcribed, because, as
                    James Lockhart has shown, the use of Spanish loanwords in Nahuatl is
                    period-specific. As with the other examples in this article, however, the
                    concept of a language tagging error obscures a deeper ambiguity in the language
                    itself. If a text written in Nahuatl uses the word <span class="foreign i">Dios</span>, is it accurate to describe that as a Spanish word, or would
                    it be more accurate to describe it as a Nahuatl word adopted after conquest?
                    Should we perhaps understand it as the codeswitching of a bilingual writer for
                    whom the boundaries between the two languages were not fixed? The system forces
                    a single linguistic choice where we may in fact be observing the breakdown of
                    standard linguistic categories.<a class="noteRef" href="#d5774e1520">[13]</a></div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">According to the assistive pretext of OCR, the primary purpose of automatic
                    transcription is to improve access to digitized texts. OCR accomplishes this by
                    increasing the distribution and legibility of the texts, making them accessible
                    to screen readers and making them available for digital analysis. Implicitly,
                    this process of transcription is also a neutral one: it recognizes characters,
                    rather than reading them; it transcribes them rather than writing. Under the
                    assistive pretext, acts of interpretation disappear.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">By situating optical character recognition within a longer history of
                    transcription and by conducting an analysis of several systems on which OCR is
                    based, I have suggested that the assistive pretext obscures more complex
                    analytic processes that occur alongside and within the act of transcription. The
                    complex cultural interactions embedded in early colonial transcriptions are a
                    reminder that copies, like computers, are never neutral: they inscribe the scene
                    of their production on the printed page. Similarly, the machine-recognition of
                    printed characters is a historically charged event, in which the system and its
                    data conspire to embed cultural biases in the output, or to affix them as
                    supplementary information hidden behind the screen. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p64">A broader implication of this argument is that the machinic transformations of
                    text are neither more nor less radical than those produced by the many systems
                    of interpretive reproduction that came before. Instead, much like the early
                    colonial processes of transcribing and printing the <cite class="title italic">Primeros Libros</cite>, machines transcribe the historical contingencies
                    of their use into processed texts. This matters for those interested in critical
                    textual studies because it suggests a mode for analyzing digital texts as
                    historical texts. By understanding the historical context of the tools through
                    which digital texts are processed and displayed, we can bring to the surface the
                    traces these tools leave on digital documents. This may allow us to recognize
                    how digital projects implicitly reinforce historical hierarchies of power and
                    knowledge even as our scholarship works to critique or counteract those systems. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">This research also matters for those who work to digitize historical documents
                    and seek to produce intellectually rigorous transcriptions. An attentive
                    approach to the processes through which texts are transcribed – from gathering
                    language data to selecting options and transcription tools – will enable
                    practitioners to manage the biases of digitization systems. Rather than being
                    victims of the contingencies of the tools we use, we can target the outcomes we
                    want by considering up front how tools shape text and how historical
                    expectations frame textual reproduction. Building multilingual capabilities into
                    Ocular, for example, allowed us to change the shape of early modern OCR by
                    bringing multilingual documents to the center of automatic transcription rather
                    than imposing an anachronistic, monolingual concept of textuality onto the early
                    modern period. Manually altering our language data similarly allowed the system
                    to be attuned to the unique orthographic qualities of the books in our corpus. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66">Finally, we see a great deal of potential in the amplification of the implicit
                    textual analysis that accompanies OCR. We often treat automatic transcription as
                    a preliminary step to digital analysis, a costly but necessary evil that
                    introduces needless errors without providing much analytic gain. By working with
                    Ocular’s developers, we hope to expand Ocular’s analytic capabilities, enabling
                    OCR to do more than recognize characters and output transcriptions. Rather than
                    seeking to minimize the potential damage done by OCR’s analytic systems, we hope
                    to capitalize on those processes through explicit attention to what machine
                    learning is capable of and where its limitations lie. </div>
