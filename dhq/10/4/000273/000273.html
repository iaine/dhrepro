                <p>This study examines the extent of the use of geographic code words in place of
                    racial terms in daily news reporting. This is a case study of the only daily
                    newspaper, the Toledo<cite class="title italic"> Blade</cite>, in the midwestern city
                    of Toledo, Ohio. A data set was constructed by searching a nine year collection
                    of <cite class="title italic">Blade </cite>articles, available in full-text
                    searchable format in a ProQuest database, that included the most frequently used
                    directional terms and had specific street addresses (a total of 981 stories).
                    Besides bibliographic data, each story was coded for its location and the
                    general nature of the story. Street addresses were used to compile relevant
                    census tract information on the proportion of minorities in each area
                    referenced. These references were then plotted over a street map of Toledo
                    revealing geographic distributions that do not relate to actual cardinal
                    directions. Population data corresponding to each data point was then analyzed
                    to show that directional terminology correlates with the concentration of
                    minority population. Additionally, a comprehensive content analysis of all
                    21,667 Blade articles published in this period revealed racial differences in
                    reporting. Such quantified observations are reinforced by examination of
                    particular examples of racialized usage of geographic terms.</p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1"> The headline in the Toledo<cite class="title italic"> Blade</cite> marked a senseless
                tragedy, "Police ID apparent hit-skip victim, suspect; Body of
                    Theresa James found early today in West Toledo" (<cite class="title italic">Blade</cite>, Feb. 21, 2014). According to the news story, twenty-six year old
                Ms. James was run down while walking alone late at night along a road that had no
                sidewalks. According to the <cite class="title italic">Blade </cite>her body was
                discovered in "West Toledo" and Ms. James lived in a neighborhood
                the newspaper described as "North Toledo." Curiously, her house
                in "North Toledo" was about two miles due south (and somewhat
                west) of where she was killed in "West Toledo."</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2"> How was it that "North Toledo" lay south of "West
                    Toledo" according to the newspaper of record in Northwest Ohio?
                Clearly the papers’ use of these terms is not strictly based on the points of a
                compass. Neither is it based on the city’s official nomenclature for its dozens of
                neighborhoods. According to the city’s published neighborhood designations, Ms.
                James was run down in a part of Toledo called "North Towne" and
                she lived in a neighborhood called "Lagrange." According to the
                official directory, there are no neighborhoods named either "West
                    Toledo" or "North Toledo" in the city (<cite class="title italic">City of Toledo Consolidated Plan</cite>).<a class="noteRef" href="#d8471e237">[1]</a> If these terms are not meant to refer to actual places or to
                geography, then they must relate to some other sort of colloquial meaning or common
                local usage. The question is, what do such terms as "North
                    Toledo" or "West Toledo" mean? </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">One important aspect of this sad story is that Ms. James was a black woman who lost
                her life in a white neighborhood. The area where Ms. James was killed, referred to
                by the local newspaper as "West Toledo," is about four-fifths
                white and one-tenth black. The community where Ms. James’ lived in "North
                    Toledo" is a mirror image of the one where she perished, four-fifths
                black and one-tenth white.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8471e261">[2]</a> These
                demographic facts made the mismatch between Ms. James race and the location of her
                accident part of the story that readers would have wanted to read and that the
                newspaper wanted to report. However, modern journalistic conventions did not permit
                race to be a prominent part of a story in which race was not an obvious element of
                the crime. The continuing widespread public belief in the relevance of race
                alongside journalistic standards that prohibit racial reporting has led to the use
                of various proxy terms to indicate race. In Toledo this has led to the adoption of
                directional terms as euphemisms for race.</div>

                the Civil Rights movement so that by the 1970s most major newspapers included more
                positive public interest stories about African Americans and black neighborhoods.
                Nevertheless, most newspapers continued to be more likely to print stories aligned
                with racial stereotypes than those counter to them [<a class="ref" href="#martindale1985">Martindale 1985</a>]

                    <cite class="title italic">Blade</cite> to routinely indicate whether the subject of
                a story was a “negro” or to clarify that the subject was "white"
                or "caucasian" when the context was unclear.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8471e307">[3]</a> While this journalistic practice faded in the 1970s and 1980s,
                readers’ beliefs that this information was highly relevant did not. Today
                journalistic standards preclude the use of racial terms except in "biographical and announcement stories,” in cases where
                        suspects or missing persons are sought and racial descriptors are relevant,
                        or “when reporting a demonstration or disturbance involving race"

                restrain responsible journalists from routinely identifying their subjects by race.
                Meanwhile, public attitudes, especially those of whites, equate blackness with
                criminality and through this lens view race as relevant to every crime story [<a class="ref" href="#sentencingproject2015">Sentencing Project 2015</a>]. Pinched between the two tines of a vice of
                their journalistic ethics and a widespread racial frame through which readers view
                news, some journalists have resorted to the routine use of proxy terms to indicate
                race without actually employing racial terms. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Among the most common of these racial proxy terms are those that substitute
                geographic for racial identifiers. Because American cities are highly segregated by
                race (and in many instances increasingly so), descriptions of a subject’s
                neighborhood could often function as a proxy for race. For instance,
                    "Harlem" served this function in Manhattan, "the
                    South Side" for Chicago, and "Watts" or
                    "Compton" for Los Angeles. In the case of Toledo, geographic
                terminology had to be invented before it could be deployed to journalistically mark
                race.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Toledo’s demographics do not permit the simple use of a single neighborhood name as a
                proxy for race. Toledo’s black community is not concentrated in any one neighborhood
                but extends diagonally in a broad band across the middle of the city. Predominantly
                white neighborhoods are scattered on the city’s periphery, with the largest
                populations to the west, south, and north of the city. (See Figure 1) This
                demographic pattern that bisected the city required either the wholesale invention
                of a new set of geographic terms, such as “middle” or “central,” or the stretching
                of existing directional terms beyond both their historical meanings and their actual
                relation to the compass. </div>

                racial descriptors was the fact that two significant directional terms were
                historically misaligned with cardinal directions. When they were first coined,
                neither "North Toledo" nor "West Toledo" were
                actually north or west of the city. North Toledo was originally a suburban
                neighborhood that grew up in the 1890s around the terminus of an early streetcar
                line about two miles east and north of the center of the city along the Maumee river
                (See Figure 2). Likewise, "West Toledo" was originally the name
                of a suburban development platted in the first decade of the Twentieth century to
                the north and west of a neighborhood that had long been known as the "West
                    End" (today commonly referred to as the "Old West
                    End"). (See Figure 3). From their origins, these neighborhoods were
                misaligned with their actual geographic namesakes by about forty-five degrees. This
                original misalignment would later give license to a wholesale unmooring of these

                growing black population had no choice but to live in a handful of integrated
                downtown districts, their neighboring whites enjoyed increasing opportunities to
                relocate to all-white suburbs. During the New Deal the federal government
                constructed subsidized segregated housing in Toledo and underwrote a mortgage
                industry while prohibiting the writing of subsidized loans in integrated
                neighborhoods. Such policies effectively constructed majority black ghettos out of
                previously ethnically mixed neighborhoods. </div>

                than one quarter. Due to the pervasive housing discrimination practiced by

                separate white school district. So stubbornly did Toledo’s leaders cling to
                discriminatory policies that in the 1970s Nixon’s Department of Housing and Urban

                    a cross-street that is almost always described as bisecting downtown, except at
                    its southernmost point where a large public housing complex sits near the corner
                    of Washington and Indiana streets. The Port Lawrence Homes, described as being
                    in the "central city," are one block from the
                        "downtown" Easystreet Cafe and next door to the

                    Greek Orthodox church which stands on the far side of Cherry street from the
                    downtown (and therefore is in "North Toledo"), is usually
                    described as being in "downtown" Toledo (<cite class="title italic">Blade</cite>, Sep. 6, 2007; Sep. 7, 2014; Apr. 30, 2011; June 26, 2010;

                    public discussions but this marking has also to be deniably race-neutral on its
                    face to be consistent with the myth that America is a color-blind society. Thus,
                    in addition to using geographic terms to refer to areas of the city, the <cite class="title italic">Blade</cite> routinely uses "North Toledo"
                    or "Central Toledo" in order to identify something or someone
                    as Black, and "West Toledo" when it wants to mark it or them

                    terms applied to the same neighborhoods, as noted above, but from the overall
                    pattern of stories found in the last nine year run of the paper. Since November
                    of 2006, 21,667 Toledo<cite class="title italic"> Blade </cite>stories containing
                    directional references to north, east, south, or west have been archived in the
                    ProQuest Newsstand database. Approximately one in five of the stories that
                    included directional references associated with predominantly white areas (west,
                    south, and east) also included terms that indicated some act of violence (shot,
                    shooting, robbery, stabbing, rape, murder, beating, arson). However, the
                    frequency of similar references to violent crimes were far higher for those
                    directional references associated with majority black neighborhoods (north and
                    central). Compared with "West Toledo" the rate of reference
                    to violent crimes was nearly fifty percent higher for "North
                        Toledo" and for "Central Toledo." (See Table

                    crime rates in those neighborhoods most frequently identified by directional

                    comparable crime rate for each directional section of the city was calculated by
                    averaging together the overall crime rate of the census tract containing each
                    specific street address mentioned in a <cite class="title italic">Blade</cite> story.
                    While the number of stories involving crimes identified as taking place in
                        "North" Toledo was twice that of similar stories in
                        "West" Toledo, overall crime rates in the locations
                    referenced in those stories was less than 10% greater than crime rates in the
                        "West." Likewise, twice as many crime stories were
                    located in the "Central" city while the average crime rates
                    of all the locations mentioned was less than 10% greater than those parts of the
                        "West" city deemed newsworthy. Such results point to the
                    greater likelihood that a story will include reference to a majority black
                    community (by way of directional proxy) if the story includes a crime. </div>

                    from their pages. However, the public’s demand for news conveyed in a manner
                    that matched their racial conceptions did not similarly lessen. Between the
                    pressures to report news that conformed to popular psychological maps of the
                    community and the restraint of newly colorblind journalistic standards a dilemma
                    was created that racial proxies were able to resolve. Over the last quarter of
                    the century a new journalistic habit of using directional euphemisms became
                    ubiquitous. </div>

                    indicates that the newspaper routinely employs terms such as "North
                        Toledo" or "Central Toledo" to signal to
                    readers that the subject of a story is African American, and the term
                        "West Toledo," to signal that the subject is White.
                    Evidence of this purposeful signaling is that none of these terms are employed
                    in a consistent directional context (as evidenced visually on a map) and that
                    the locations of references to "North Toledo" and
                        "Central Toledo" are associated with an
                    overrepresentation of African American subjects compared both with their total
                    share of the metropolitan population and their share of even those census tracts
                    with the most concentrated minority population in the city. Moreover, of the
                    scores of proper names for city neighborhoods, only those that are used to
                    signal whiteness in a majority nonwhite community, such as "Old West
                        End,"
                    "Downtown," and "Polish Village," are
                    regularly employed in the newspaper. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">In the Twenty-First century the use of explicit racial language has declined
                    under the pressure of a reigning ethos of color-blindness. In place of
                    sustaining racist stereotypes of black criminality and shiftlessness by directly
                    referring to the race of individuals or communities being reported about, code
                    words that appear on their face to be race neutral have gained currency instead.
                    Scholars such as Eduardo Bonilla-Silva have shown that the use of such coded
                    language effectively transmits racial meaning while maintaining the appearance
                    of color-blindness [<a class="ref" href="#bonillasilva2010">Bonilla-Silva 2010</a>] l [<a class="ref" href="#campbell1995">Campbell 1995</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#entman2006">Entman 2006</a>]. Teun A. van Dijk reminds media scholars that news
                    is not just a matter of what is printed on the page or projected on the screen,
                    but is an entire system of discourse involving both the conventions of
                    journalism and the social knowledge and the historically constructed frameworks
                    through which readers decode the news text. Racial marking through geographic
                    proxies only functions because news consumers supply their own racial
                    assumptions about their community and successfully decode these cues through a
                    racist frame. Thus, even without explicitly using race as a descriptor, news
                    stories can effectively convey that race is a salient element to the story, or
                    even the central aspect of the story itself [<a class="ref" href="#vandijk2000">van Dijk 2000</a>].</div>

                    Nellie Tran and Susan Paterson have documented how whites denied their racial
                    privilege and maintained their performance of color-blindness by employing the
                    word "American" as a proxy for "white." By
                    switching American for white such individuals allowed themselves to think in
                    terms of racial norms and desired racial privileges while denying racism as a
                    force in society [<a class="ref" href="#tran2015">Tran et al 2015</a>].</div>

                    community by reinforcing the feelings of belonging of some and symmetrically

                        exclusion" while originally applied to distinctions of national
                    versus foreign, also applies to how news reporting marks its subjects racially
                    through the mechanism of proxy terms. "One important way of identifying outsiders is not in
                            the direct reporting of the facts of the case but in the metaphorical
                            cluster of words used to generate an implicit picture of the groups
                            described."

                    operate. Any particular news outlets’ continued relevance to its readership
                    depends upon its stories being written in such a way that the values and
                    meanings most important to these readers is conveyed. In spite of the widespread
                    belief that America today is a colorblind society and in spite of a public
                    culture praising diversity and tolerance, Americans continue to view their
                    communities through racialized lenses. As long as the underlying demand for news

                        site:google.com/newspapers (accessed Nov. 21-Nov.25, 2014). Google’s archive
                        is comprehensive going back to 1940, but because Google’s search engine
                        relies on OCR scans of microfilmed editions of the newspaper, only a small
                        subset of stories are captured by any individual query. While there may be
                        search bias against older newspapers as their microfilmed condition was in
                        many cases worse than more recent years, this bias does not seem to extend
                        past the 1950s. To check for this bias a search was done on a term whose
                        usage is presumably ubiquitous in local news through all decades. The term
                            "mayor" was selected and it appeared in equal
                        frequency in the decades of the 1960s and the 1990s. Likewise, as can be
                        seen in Figure 1 above, nearly as many references to "North
                            Toledo" appeared in the 1950s as in the 1990s. Note, figures
                        for the decade of the 2000s are systematically reduced as Google’s archive
                        extends only to 2007.</div><div class="endnote" id="d8471e1415"><span class="noteRef">[18]</span>"Table 36. Ohio - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Large Cities
