                <p>This paper asks the question: Do the humanities by necessity have a digital
                    future? It argues that the answer to this question is both yes and no. The
                    argument looks through the lens of DIY culture as an attempt to try and
                    understand the future for the humanities in terms of both cultural material and
                    processes. The argument is made first by examining the case of information
                    sharing within DIY culture as an expression of current day cultural material.
                    Secondly, it illustrated how traditional humanities scholarship, such as reading
                    ancient documents, compares to it’s DIY equivalent within family history
                    circles, and how both will continue to use digital and non-digital methods.</p>

                    by understanding the humanities as the study of human culture and cultural

                    activities, which can be anything from building a shed or knitting a sweater to
                    running a food co-op, with the prerequisite that the practitioner has no
                    relevant formal education or training. DIY culture can, in many ways, be seen as
                    simultaneously an online and an offline culture, with a complex relationship
                    between digital and non-digital activity and interaction. Due to its rising
                    relevance, particularly on the internet, it is important that the humanities
                    include the study of DIY culture and its cultural products - digital,
                    non-digital and everything in between. </div>

                    intangible, such as music, arts, crafts, rituals, literature and linguistics.
                    The humanities have a long history of attempting to understand these different
                    products of the past and the present. The methods with which these attempts have
                    been made often strongly depend on the formats of the material as well as on the
                    technology that is available to the scholars in question [<a class="ref" href="#bod2014">Bod 2014</a>]. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">DIY culture constitutes an important part of human culture today. Gelber (1999)
                    portrays productive leisure activities (<em class="term">hobbies</em>) as an antidote to
                    more problematic leisure activities (e.g. drinking or gambling) and idleness
                    following in the wake of the separation of work and leisure brought on by
                    industrialisation. An antidote supported by authorities:<blockquote><p>
                        Teachers, recreation directors, journalists, and other
                            voices of authority have felt free to encourage the autonomy and
                            creativity of hobbies because even if they sensed that hobbies could
                            critique regular work, they also recognized that hobbies’ triumph over
                            idleness was a victory for the values of a market economy.
                         [<a class="ref" href="#gelber1999">Gelber 1999</a>, 3]
                    </p></blockquote></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">In other words: " Hobbies have been a way to confirm the verities of
                            work and the free market inside the home so long as remunerative
                            employment has remained elsewhere."
                         [<a class="ref" href="#gelber1999">Gelber 1999</a>, 4]</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Gelber uses the existing term <em class="term">hobbies</em> (which after 1880 came to be
                    known as a productive use of free time rather than a dangerous obsession) to
                    talk about productive leisure activities such as collecting, handicrafts,
                    husbandry, amateurism and volunteerism. Stebbins, on the other hand, has
                    hobbies, amateurism and volunteerism side by side as different types of serious
                    leisure pursuits [<a class="ref" href="#stebbins2007">Stebbins 2007</a>]. In Gelber’s view, DIY (which
                    includes crafts and maintenance) is a less creative and more productive hobby
                    focussing on producing something useful and perhaps necessary to the household.
                    Matchar, on the other hand, focuses on the household aspects in the term

                        Our nostalgia for old-fashioned home and hearth has
                            transformed our food culture as well. Who hasn’t tried canning jam or
                            making their own pickles? Young women who, had they been of age in the
                            1990s, might have been boozing it up in the Meatpacking District [New

                            photographing them for their food blogs. The kinds of kitchen work once
                            associated with Depression-era farmwives - making curds and whey,
                            preserving sauerkraut, grinding flour - are now thoroughly unremarkable

                         [<a class="ref" href="#gelber1999">Gelber 1999</a>, 41]. Matchar particularly notes the spread of anti-authoritarian
                    disillusionment and this could be seen as a result of the ease of which ideas
                    and information can and has spread on the internet during the latest recession.
                    The internet furthermore plays a large role in the aspects of DIY and DIY

                    Unruh uses social worlds to refer to a social organisation that cannot be
                    defined by spatial, territorial, formal or membership boundaries [<a class="ref" href="#unruh1980">Unruh 1980</a>]. Instead, a social world is defined through
                    interaction and communication. DIY culture exists worldwide and varieties of DIY
                    culture can be seen in most societies. There are no rules on how you engage with
                    DIY culture and anyone can be part of it. Although there are no spatial,

                    focus. How a sweater is knitted or how the shed is built is secondary here. In
                    fact, the act of knitting a sweater or building a shed is not in itself a DIY
                    activity as these tasks can also be accomplished by professionals with the
                    relevant formal education or training. The focus lies instead on how information
                    is gathered that enables people to build sheds, or the social setting in which
                    someone is motivated and gathers knowledge that enables them to knit the
                    sweater, when they have had no formal training to do so. Thus, it is the
                    autodidact information behaviour, which is the foundation of DIY activities,

                            from non-teaching situations, in one way or another.

                    closely related to research in Human Information Behaviour, especially that in
                    our everyday life: <blockquote><p>
                        Information Behaviour is the totality of human behaviour

                            active and passive information seeking, and information use. Thus, it
                            includes face-to-face communication with others, as well as the passive
                            reception of information as in, for example, watching TV advertisements,
                            without any intention to act on the information given.

                    one-way access to information and the ways in which the individual can use this
                    information. However, the field of Everyday Life Information Seeking [<a class="ref" href="#savolainen1995">Savolainen 1995</a>] (ELIS) has lead to a more rounded understanding
                    of information behaviour, which includes the social and collaborative nature of
                    human interaction with information (i.e. the field of CIB - Collaborative
                    Information Behaviour) [<a class="ref" href="#talja2006">Talja and Hansen</a>]. Thus, information behaviour
                    is a complex area of seeking, finding, sharing, creating new and remixing old
                    information. In everyday life this information behaviour becomes even more
                    complex in a world of overlapping tasks for which information is sought, found,
                    shared, presented and even ignored or discarded [<a class="ref" href="#karlova2013">Karlova and Fisher 2013</a>].
                    Therefore, most ELIS studies tend to focus on a certain task or activity for
                    which it is easier to identify a group of participants. This could, for example,
                    be parenting [<a class="ref" href="#mckenzie2003">McKenzie 2003</a>] or health issues [<a class="ref" href="#yeoman2010">Yeoman 2010</a>] as well as DIY activities such as genealogy [<a class="ref" href="#yakel2004">Yakel 2004</a>], knitting [<a class="ref" href="#prigoda2007">Prigoda and McKenzie 2007</a>], gourmet

                    that usually require a certain amount of autodidact information behaviour in
                    order to engage with the activity. This has been the case since the first
                    mentions of a DIY movement in the 1950s [<a class="ref" href="#mead1957">Mead 1957</a>] where there
                    was an increase in instructions on how-to do it yourself experienced a boom.
                    This how-to genre has developed into a DIY activity in itself and this type of
                    material is ever growing on the Internet and in print. The enormous amounts of
                    information sharing currently going on between DIY practitioners around the
                    world is creating a new type of cultural material that we in the humanities need
                    to understand in order to understand current culture. </div>

                    culture, with a complex relationship between digital and non-digital activity
                    and interaction. In order to make this argument we will begin by looking at the
                    relationship between time spent on and off the internet, for people of all age
                    groups.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Sigman argues that time spent online displaces face-to-face contact, and he

                    relate to increased illness and premature mortality [<a class="ref" href="#sigman2009">Sigman 2009</a>].
                    While the connection between lack of social interaction and health issues is
                    strong, it seems to be more difficult to find specific connections between
                    internet use and health issues. Findings here are more mixed, with some studies
                    showing a more positive correlation. As an example, Cotton and colleagues showed
                    how internet use among older adults (50 years or older) reduced depression
                    categorization by 33%[<a class="ref" href="#cotten2012">Cotten et al 2012</a>].</div>

                    between correlation and causality. If we make the assumption that there is a
                    correlation between a high degree of loneliness and a large amount of time spent
                    online, do people who spend much time online become lonely as a result of less
                    face-to-face contact or is it the case that people who are lonely spend more
                    time online, perhaps in order to achieve more social contact via a digital
                    media? Another suggestion is that there is a third factor involved which causes
                    a high degree of both loneliness and spending time online, for example bullying
                    or a general lack of closeness in one’s social network. It is not an easy
                    question to answer and findings seem to depend on the groups of people that are
                    studied. Staying with the example of loneliness, which can take different shapes
                    (e.g. social or emotional loneliness), the size of social networks can for
                    example have a larger impact on the social loneliness of young adults, while the
                    lack of closeness to other members of a social network can have a larger impact

                    and I am sympathetic to their plight. The future of the tech industry relies on
                    young people interested in working within that discipline and industry. However,
                    we need to consider the following difficult and troubling suggestion: "even though young people grow up surrounded by
                            technology, many of them don’t understand the basic concepts of how it
                            works – which will leave them unable to fully participate in
                            society"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#bt2015">BT 2015</a>]. Statements like this assume that an understanding of how the internet
                    and the technology behind the internet works is necessary for participation in
                    society. But does technology shape society or culture, or is it culture and
                    society that shape technology?</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24"> Technology is a product of the human mind, not the other way around. So perhaps
                    the issue with young people's understanding of the internet is that they
                    understand it differently from those who did not grow up with it. For the older
                    generation a computer is still technology, it is apart from us. For the younger
                    generation, on the other hand, it is perhaps not. For them the computer provides
                    opportunities to connect - the internet an abstraction which they only
                    experience when it is not available. </div>

                    that even babies can differentiate between real live interaction via screen on

                    communication mediated via screen bears a closer resemblance to physical
                    socialising than to screen entertainment. Thus there is no need to understand
                    technology, in order to socially interact with others via digital media. It is
                    just a means for us as humans to connect, to access information, to express

                    cultural products out there that we have not yet even begun to consider. At the

                    but rather the products of the human mind or as cultural products. Historian Roy
                    Rosenzweig made this same point in relation to Wikipedia, saying that it was "the most important application of the principles of the
                            free and open-source software movement to the world of cultural, rather
                            than software, production"

                    Understanding machines or technology may give us some tools to study the
                    internet, but it will never give us the ability to understand the content. For
                    this we need methods developed for the understanding of cultural products, in
                    other words humanities methods. So, to answer the question again; yes, the
                    humanities do have a necessary digital future in that it will be necessary to
                    use digital tools to study both digital and non-digital material, and no,

                    stayed the same and that technology merely added speed or ease to certain
                    aspects of the process. For example the speed of finding parallel readings in
                    the same or other corpora or the ease with which evidence that supported certain
                    readings is remembered [<a class="ref" href="#rouedcunliffe2013">Roued-Cunliffe 2013</a>]. In this example the
                    materials studied (i.e. ancient documents from the Roman fort of Vindolanda in
                    the North of England<a class="noteRef" href="#d9996e467">[4]</a>) are cultural products that
                    at first were not digital. However, the fragile state of most of these documents
                    as well as the physical location of the scholars was such that the documents
                    studied were often in fact digital photographs. Here scholars moved from the
                    study of physical objects to the study of digital objects. The methods for
                    studying the documents were very traditional for the field of papyrology. Terras
                    describes the complex and cyclical process in the following way: <blockquote><p>
                        An expert reads an ancient document by identifying
                            visual features, and then incrementally building up knowledge about the
                            document’s characters, combinations of characters, words, grammar,
                            phrases, and meaning, continually proposing hypotheses, and checking
                            those against other information, until s/he finds that this process is
                            exhausted
                         [<a class="ref" href="#terras2005">Terras 2005</a>, 54]
                    </p></blockquote>. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">Along the way there are aspects of this process that are typically done by
                    non-digital means but which can alternatively be <em class="emph">aided</em> by digital
                    technology. First is the identification of visual features where the scholars,
                    in the case of quite illegible incised texts, would typically use a light source
                    to cast a shadow on the document and by tipping the document to and fro this
                    enables the scholar to make out the incisions [<a class="ref" href="#brady2005">Brady et al 2005</a>]. This
                    is a cumbersome and unreliable method and therefore the project attempted to aid
                    this task with digital image processing techniques [<a class="ref" href="#terras2012">Terras 2012</a>]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">The second part of the process is the building up of knowledge about the
                    characters, words and phrases in the document. Typically, this will happen today
                    by keeping digital and non-digital notes about the different interpretations and
                    decisions made along the way. Therefore, attempts were made at showing how a
                    digital "Decision Support System" would enable the scholar to
                    organise and remember these interpretations and the basis on which they were
                    made [<a class="ref" href="#rouedcunliffe2013">Roued-Cunliffe 2013</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">The final part of the process, as described here, is checking against other
                    information. This traditionally required access to copies of published editions
                    that could contain relevant parallels to the documents being studied. Potential
                    parallels would be found by trawling through indices. This is a part of the
                    process of reading ancient documents where digital technology and the internet
                    has had a great influence. By digitally publishing interpreted editions online
                    (using XML), and by making them accessible through search engines this task has
                    become much lighter and has made the texts more easily accessible by scholars
                    around the world. As the example shows, even a traditional digital humanities
                    project that works with digital tools for the reading of handwritten texts
                    continually oscillates between digital and non-digital tools, methods and
                    material.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">However, as this second example will show, the reading of handwritten texts is
                    not a method used only by scholars in academia. Genealogy is probably the most
                    well-known DIY activity in which the skill of reading old handwritten texts is
                    quite essential. My own experience of working with family history and engaging
                    with other genealogists has led to a few observations in relation to this
                    skill:</div>
                <div class="ptext"><ol class="list"><li class="item">Genealogists, depending on their level of experience, usually have some
                        skills in reading handwritten texts, ranging from beginners to experts. </li><li class="item">These experts are able to read Latin texts, written in a very illegible
                        Gothic script.</li><li class="item">Experts and beginners alike usually collaborate on the reading of texts
                        that are related to their own family history and they do this both online
                        and offline.</li><li class="item">Genealogists usually gather the skills and knowledge needed for this task
                        through the different autodidact information situations mentioned
                        above.</li><li class="item">Genealogists use a greater variety of different digital tools and
                        platforms depending on their level of digital literacy, than I have
                        experienced among scholars.</li></ol></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">For these skills particularly, genealogists and other amateur historians are
                    regularly used as volunteer transcribers in museums and archives. With digital
                    media and the internet, GLAM institutions (i.e. galleries, libraries, archives
                    and museums) are now able to structure these skills and use them more
                    efficiently to transcribe material in their collections; in other words, to use
                    these skills in crowdsourcing projects [<a class="ref" href="#ridge2013">Ridge 2013</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">This second example suggests that perhaps the skills involved are not what
                    separates the DIY practitioner from the professional practitioner, neither is
                    the need for social networking or collaboration. The motivations for reading
                    handwritten documents are most likely the same, namely recognition and
                    furthering their understanding of the subject at hand. Perhaps what really
                    divides the waters is the information behaviour and whether this is taught or it
                    is autodidact. The consequence of this difference is often that DIY
                    practitioners are in a position to be more adaptable and innovative in their use
                    of digital technology in a way that can be difficult within the organisational
                    structures surrounding the humanities.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">Nevertheless, one lesson that can be learned from both examples is that the very
                    traditional humanities method of reading handwritten texts, whether or not it is
                    done as a DIY activity, will involve digital tools in one way or another. </div>
            </div>
            <div class="div div0">
                <h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">DIY culture is a social world of people engaging in DIY activities, which have in
                    common that they are activities undertaken without any formal education or
                    training. Information behaviour in DIY culture is autodidact and information
                    sharing is informal and outside of organisational structures. Furthermore, it is
                    rarely dependant on funding and thus has the potential to incorporate innovative
                    solutions at a higher speed than we typically see in the humanities. This is why
                    on the one hand it is important for the Digital Humanities to look towards DIY
                    culture and learn from the methods and practises that occur here. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">On the other hand, the information sought, created and shared within DIY culture,
                    both on– and offline, is a product of the human mind and can, along with more
                    traditional cultural products, be understood by humanities scholars. The
                    Internet is currently exploding with this material, alongside more frivolous
                    entertainment content. If we in the humanities want to understand our current
                    culture, now and in the future, we need to study DIY culture, both off- and
                    online to a much higher degree than is currently the case. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Therefore, the answer to the question whether the humanities by necessity have a
                    digital future is two-fold. Yes, the humanities need to employ digital tools in
                    order to understand culture and cultural products on the internet However,
                    humanities does not have a solely digital future as culture and cultural
                    products will continue to blossom offline and traditional humanities methods are
                    needed in order to understand these too. </div>
