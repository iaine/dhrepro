                <p>This article demonstrates the use of data mining methodologies for the study and
                    research of social media in the digital humanities. Drawing from recent
                    convergences in writing, rhetoric, and DH research, this article investigates
                    how trends operate within complex networks. Through a study of trend data mined
                    from Twitter, this article suggests the possibility of identifying a
                        <em class="term">virality threshold</em> for Twitter trends, and the possibility that
                    such a threshold has broader implications for attention ecology research in the
                    digital humanities. This article builds on the theories of Jacques Derrida,
                    Richard Lanham, and Sidney Dobrin to suggest new theories and methodologies for
                    understanding how attention operates within complex media ecologies at a
                    macroscopic level. While many various theories and methods have investigated
                    writing, rhetoric, and digital media at the microscopic level, this article
                    contends that a complimentary macroscopic approach is needed to further
                    investigate how attention functions for network culture.</p>
            </div>
            
        
        
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The phrase "this is trending" is so common, so deceptively innocent, that it
                often passes from speaker to listener without an opportunity to interrogate its
                validity. Nearly every broadcast of cable news, sports journalism, or entertainment
                media relies on this phrase to justify the attention paid to a particular event or
                topic of interest. For many forms of digital rhetoric, having "this is
                    trending" attached to a digital artifact is, in and of itself, the desired
                end goal for producing those artifacts — millions, and possibly, billions of visits,
                views, likes, or shares. This phrase quantifies attention and repackages it as a
                statement of value. Indeed, "this is trending" is no mere economics of
                attention. This phrase suggests that the object it describes has, during the process
                of attention accretion, become more than its accounting — the trending object
                acquires value. If attention somehow creates value for trending objects, then this
                process becomes even more powerful for digital artifacts that hyper-circulate at a
                viral level. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Such questions of circulation and virality are of interest within writing studies,
                but writing-related fields are nascent in the use, approach, and methods related to
                the digital humanities. Recent conversations in writing studies, rhetoric, and
                composition have attempted to predict and understand how these fields might pursue
                research questions made possible by digital humanities tools, methods, and
                resources, or, at least, better understand where these fields intersect with the
                digital humanities. For instance, in their collection <cite class="title italic">Rhetoric
                    and the Digital Humanities</cite>, Jim Ridolfo and William Hart-Davidson write
                that although writing studies has a rich tradition in performing analysis with
                digital tools, building new tools, and securing National Endowments for the
                Humanities (NEH) Office of Digital Humanities (ODH) Digital Humanities Start-Up
                grants, there has been little understanding of how these fields intersect: "Despite the lengthy history of the term <em class="term">digital
                            humanities</em> outside rhetoric and writing studies, inside the field
                        of rhetoric and writing studies there has been, up until recently, very
                        limited mention of it"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2015">Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson 2015</a>, 2]. In addition, many DHers within English departments might be unfamiliar with
                how writing studies has made strides toward this field. Ridolfo and Hart-Davidson
                argue that this is, in part, due to the field’s concern with the teaching of writing
                within composition and professional writing classes, this concern mostly focusing on
                how such classes might adopt computers and other technology as part of its pedagogy.
                However, as writing studies moves away from researching writing primarily in terms
                of students and pedagogy, toward researching writing without subjects, digital
                humanities tools provide even more opportunity for looking at large data sets of
                writing that are not tied to questions of student agency or learning outcomes. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Despite this turn away from writing subjects, the concept of audience remains central
                to research in rhetoric and writing studies. But in the era of Big Data and
                information overflow, it is increasingly difficult to identify an audience. While
                recent work with the canon of delivery, such as Collin Brooke’s work in <cite class="title italic">Lingua Fracta</cite>
                [<a class="ref" href="#brooke2009">Brooke 2009</a>] or Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle Nicole DeVoss’s concept of "rhetorical velocity"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2009">Ridolfo and DeVoss 2009</a>] attempt to account for audience reception via electronic delivery and the
                digital circulation of multimodal writing, these theories often focus on
                audience-as-user, how audience members, as individuals, receive and then
                re-circulate writing toward other audiences. Such theories are useful in thinking
                through how an audience remixes and re-delivers writing, but do not address the
                larger scales across which digital writing now circulates. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In his work <cite class="title italic">Postcomposition</cite>, Sidney I. Dobrin argues
                that writing studies needs to push its investigations into these larger scales, into
                complex understandings of hyper-circulation and writing-as-system [<a class="ref" href="#dobrin2011">Dobrin 2011</a>]. Dobrin’s argument parallels those made about literature
                studies, lately by Matthew Jockers, who proposes a methodology of macroanalysis to
                account for how patterns or trends emerge across large data sets of literary texts
                    [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>]. The macroscopic perspective has often been
                understood in terms of "distance" and "artificial constructs" within the
                humanities — what Franco Moretti has termed "distance reading." As Moretti
                explains, "abstraction is not an end in itself, but a way to widen the
                        domain of the literary historian, and enrich its internal
                        problematic"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2007">Moretti 2007</a>, 1]. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Toward a macroanalysis of writing, this article performs a macroanalysis of Twitter
                in order to extend a theory of hyper-circulation that can help explain how
                macro-audiences engage with digital writing technologies. This article builds on
                Dobrin’s network theory by looking at how the concept of attention provides a
                macroscopic understanding of audience in complex networks of mediation. If many of
                the attempts underway to rewrite rhetorical concepts, such as delivery, focus on the
                microscopic invention and delivery of digital texts (the agency of individual
                users/writers), then attention ecology is the attempt to understand the macroscopic,
                aggregate trends occurring within social media as a way of identifying an audience
                in complex networks of mediation. Ultimately, the authors identify the term
                    <em class="term">virality threshold</em> as a concept that may be useful for future
                researchers interested in macroscopic analyses of writing and audience. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Certainly, the use of contagion metaphors (such as virality) to understand the spread
                of ideas and information among social groups is not new. Likewise, the threshold
                concept is also not a new addition to the discourse of idea circulation. Prior to
                the Internet and the subsequent invention of contemporary social networks, the terms
                    <em class="term">contagion</em> and <em class="term">threshold</em> were core concepts for
                Diffusion of Innovations (DoI) theory. Like the digital humanities, DoI was
                necessarily interdisciplinary as it sought to understand how new ideas were spread
                and adopted within various areas such as rural sociology, communication, education,
                marketing, general sociology, anthropology, economics, political science,
                agriculture, psychology, statistics, engineering, and others [<a class="ref" href="#rogers1983">Rogers 1983</a>, 53]. Everett M. Rogers' <cite class="title italic">Diffusion of Innovations</cite>, originally written in 1962, is credited with
                collating a diverse array of ideas from various disciplines to better understand "the process by which an innovation is communicated through
                        certain channels over time among the members of a social system"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#rogers1983">Rogers 1983</a>, 6]. Rogers’ initial description of DoI theory focuses on the relationship
                between the concept of adoption and the idea of the threshold. Certainly, there are
                similarities between Rogers’ use of the term adoption and this article’s use of the
                term attention. For example, Rogers uses the example of people considering whether
                or not to join a riot or protest. In this example, an individual’s threshold is
                determined by the number of other people a person needs to observe taking part in
                the protest before they too will join. The concept of threshold, for DoI, thus
                refers to the amount of other adoptions a particular person needs to observe before
                they will adopt an innovation or action themselves. Someone who may be described as
                an early adopter will have a low threshold for the number of people they need to
                observe before choosing to take part in the protest. However, a person who needs to
                observe a large amount of people taking part in the protest would be described as
                having a high threshold according to Rogers — and therefore, they would be a defined
                as a late adopter. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">DoI theory remains active and relevant today for the study of social networks. Thomas
                W. Valente’s <cite class="title italic">Network Models of the Diffusion of
                    Innovations</cite> applies DoI theory to network analysis, and recent
                scholarship that applies DoI to the study of Twitter and other social networks
                builds on his work. Valente defines network analysis as "a technique used to analyze the pattern of interpersonal
                        communication in a social system by determining who talks to whom"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#valente1995">Valente 1995</a>, 2]. While this article draws upon the interdisciplinary history and terminology
                made available by DoI theory, it also diverges from DoI theory in two key ways.
                First, recent theoretical work in writing studies puts pressure on network theories
                that are non-ecological — meaning, network theories that focus on individual users
                within individual networks, rather than focusing on the complex interactions of
                multiple networks. Therefore, this article replaces the user-as-node (person to
                person transmission of ideas within an individual network) with the location-as-node
                model (the circulation of ideas among and within multiple locations — among and
                within multiple networks). In contrast to user-as-node approaches, this article
                looks neither at users (or the adoption of ideas or innovations by users) nor does
                this article focus on any specific trend. Instead, this study considers only that a
                trend occurred, and that it was circulated among locations. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">As a result of the focus on locations rather than users (or subjects, or agents), the
                term <em class="term">adoption</em> from DoI theory is replaced with the term
                    <em class="term">attention</em> in this study — this is the second divergence from DoI
                theory. We argue that one way of analyzing how hyper-circulation occurs is by
                searching for indicators of attention and the degree to which such attention
                escalates. Using data science methodologies, we introduce a preliminary operational
                definition of "virality threshold" as one concept for beginning to think about
                macroscopic attention for writing studies and digital humanities
                    research.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9512e377">[1]</a> If attention
                is to provide an effective framework for thinking about networked writing and
                macroscopic audiences, then scholars must begin to carefully investigate the
                terminology used within such a framework. The term "viral" is often used to
                indicate that a text, topic, or digital artifact has hyper-circulated among multiple
                networks of mediation and gained a significant amount of attention. But what is the
                difference between something that is merely trending and something that has become
                viral? Why might such determinations be critical to writing studies and digital
                humanities research?</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Trends themselves have become the basis for news reports — CNN, ESPN, Fox, MSNBC —
                all of these media networks now use the phrase "this is trending" as the basis
                for discussing a topic or bringing something to viewers’ attention. This phenomenon
                is not an altogether new occurrence. Viewer polls — asking viewers to give an
                opinion or respond to a questionnaire — have provided a similar form of feedback for
                television and print journalism. Exit polls in elections also provide similar
                feedback, because voters provide immediate feedback about their choices or opinions
                while the voting process is still underway. The immediate question raised by trend
                feedback is whether trends are popular (and sometimes viral) because of the content
                of the trends, or whether some trends become popular because they gain enough
                momentum and inertia to continue acquiring attention as circulation increases. Does
                trend feedback become a veritable snowball effect that may, at times, lead to
                virality? The obvious answer to this question is yes, trend feedback is no doubt
                occurring. People care about what is popular or trendy merely because those things
                are popular and trendy — even if viewers disagree with the actual content of their
                feeds and networks, the question of whether content merits trending in the first
                place seems to now be secondary to the question of whether content has gained
                attention. This is why operational definitions for terms like <em class="term">trend</em>,
                    <em class="term">virality</em>, and <em class="term">attention</em> are crucial for understanding
                and critiquing network culture.</div>

                    of which are constantly vying for a meaningful portion of the available "bandwidth" of "human"

                    understands human attention in similar economic terms to Davenport and Beck’s,
                    but rather than seeing attention as an issue of human management, Lanham’s
                    attention framework operates with the assumption that the "devices that regulate attention are stylistic

                    explains that while information is widely available, human attention is a scarce
                    resource to be carefully allocated through broad rhetorical applications of
                        <em class="term">style</em> — one of the five canons of rhetoric. Attention is a
                    crucial term for research into digital media because an attentive audience can
                    no longer be assumed — the mind numbing noise of information overflow is the new
                    norm. Constantly updated social network feeds, 24 hour news networks, movies,
                    blogs, ebooks, digital media, print media, ubiquitous screens, and always
                    available interfaces — all fighting for attention — try to shock, entertain, or
                    scare users into viewing for as long as possible.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">In fact, attention itself acquires attention — the "tipping point" as it has
                    commonly been called of late — when humans notice that a significant number of
                    other humans are paying attention to something specific. In DoI theory, this is
                    called "critical mass." Critical mass, in innovation diffusion theory, is
                    achieved when "the minimum number of participants needed to
                        sustain a collective activity" has been reached. However, the problem
                    with critical mass, as Thomas W. Valente notes, is that often critical mass is
                    achieved shortly after a disproportionately small number of people within a
                    social system have adopted an innovation. Like a school of fish avoiding a
                    predator when only a fraction of the fish actually see the predator with their
                    own eyes, the rest of the group moves in coordinated association with the group
                    as a whole. The changes in direction are chaotic on a micro level, but it is a
                    patterned and organized flow of movement from a macro perspective. </div>

                    purely rhetorical approaches to complex media ecologies — in this case, the
                    ecology of attention — may misidentify "pauses in the
                        system" or "delays in fluctuation" as more
                    traditional causal/rhetorical relationships between parts and wholes [<a class="ref" href="#dobrin2011">Dobrin 2011</a>, 141–142]. As Dobrin argues, "the whole of writing can never be explained by way of
                            its parts but instead through the properties of its
                            interconnectedness"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#dobrin2011">Dobrin 2011</a>, 144]. Therefore, the question of trend content, as the rhetorical question of
                    exigence, is only one aspect of a much broader ecology of attention, and
                    focusing on this question in isolation fails to account for broader ecological
                    and technological issues pertaining to digital media. That is not to say that
                    the questions regarding trend content ought to be ignored or drastically reduced
                    in their importance, but limiting analyses of mediation to relationships between
                    human attention and "content" will no doubt overlook key cybernetic and
                    non-human technological factors that may account for a significant portion of
                    the networked forces affecting what becomes a trend. As Dobrin argues, the
                    human-as-node model of network research cannot currently explain the complex
                    fluctuating-flow of writing that occurs during "hyper-circulation" and "network saturation"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#dobrin2011">Dobrin 2011</a>, 181–186]. Attention ecology, therefore, works to understand how complex networks
                    of mediation restructure the reception of compositions through hyperactivity and
                    continuously-fluctuating flow.</div>

                        weak ties facilitates critical mass because it permits

                            interrelations take hold. Given that strange loops contribute to the
                            openness of autopoietic systems, we must concede that it is in the

                    level, but attempting to explain how attention may be regulated, redirected, or
                    acquired within complex systems of mediation requires a more careful and
                    well-tested definition. The primary reason this study does not limit attention
                    to "humans" (whatever that may mean) is because a composition or
                    inscription may jump from a human network to a nonhuman network (not that these
                    are ever totally inseparable) due to the reiteration of bot readers/writers and
                    the activity of weak artificial "intelligences" already at work among the
                    many available networks of mediation. The more intensely studied canons of
                    rhetoric — invention, arrangement, and style — may have very little to do with
                    what gains attention, and certainly even less of an effect on what "goes
                        viral." Many of our art, literature, and film studies colleagues often
                    lament the artistic quality and cultural benefit of what becomes popular in
                    film, music, literature, and art. Part of this can be explained by massive
                    marketing campaigns and corporate agendas regarding media and entertainment
                    choices available to consumers, but a large amount of what becomes popular on a
                        "grassroots" or "viral" level of attention is just as difficult
                    for critics to applaud as quality art or meaningful cultural contribution.

                    of understanding how attention is redirected or acquired within complex
                    networks. Writing in social media is not limited to the modality of unicode text
                    that appears on computer screens, but writing is understood in the broader sense
                    of any digital modality (text, image, audio, video, etc.) that may be used to
                    make meaning. The basic unit of analysis for this article — iteration — is taken
                    from Jacques Derrida’s work in <cite class="title italic">Signature Event
                        Context</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="#derrida1988">Derrida 1988</a>]. In <cite class="title italic">Signature</cite>, Derrida
                    uses the concept of iteration — the movement of writing through time and space —
                    to undercut simplistic notions of communication derived from speech act theory.
                    For Derrida, iteration is "the spacing" that
                    (re)moves writing from its original determinate "context," and this movement or "force of
                        rupture" is what "constitutes writing."
                    Writing moves through time (iterates) because of its ability to repeat and
                    reproduce an "alterity" of its prior form in "absence" of any original intent of meaning or content
                        [<a class="ref" href="#derrida1988">Derrida 1988</a>, 9]. This removal, or spacing, occurs
                    because writing reiterates its collection of signifiers at a later point in
                    time. Social networks provide the possibility of locating iterations of writing
                    across time and space. Of course, this possibility is not unique to social
                    networks, but the availability of temporal and location-based data, provided by
                    social media networks, makes this study more feasible through expedient access
                    to large amounts of networked writing.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9512e585">[3]</a></div>

                    types. A differential typology integrates the various classes or categories of
                    which it is comprised. Therefore, the differential typology utilized in this
                    study is as follows: iterative writing is writing that moves, but this movement
                    is a derivative of two other basic components: time and space. While time and
                    space are relative to one another, time is iteration’s constant. In other words,
                    even if writing does not move spatially (from one space, place, or location to
                    another), it is always reiterating temporally (it is always moving through
                    time). </div>

                    their libraries. The Internet and digital technologies have not substantially
                    changed the functional integration of writing and movement — writing has never

                    circulation among users and their respective locations are often the driving
                    force behind the development of new writing networks. Codex technologies (often,
                    paper books) require something else to move them from one space to another, and
                    historically this role was often provided by publishers, book stores, and
                    libraries. Technologies like Twitter, on the other hand, were developed to move
                    and circulate writing among a network of users — Facebook, Instagram, YouTube,
                    and Vine were all built with this core functionality in mind. This intentional
                    circulation to encourage more circulation is what Jim Ridolfo and Dànielle
                    Nicole DeVoss call "rhetorical velocity," where new
                    combinations of digital delivery and multimodal production form the basis for
                    understanding writing as it relates to movement and circulation [<a class="ref" href="#ridolfo2009">Ridolfo and DeVoss 2009</a>]. Ridolfo and DeVoss focus on microscopic deliveries,
                    what we are here calling user-as-node or the individual choices made by single
                    authors, and this is categorically different from the macroscopic analyses of
                    delivery and circulation we attempt with this article. Microscopic user-as-node
                    analyses are no doubt still crucial to ongoing research in rhetoric and writing
                    studies, and to the digital humanities more broadly conceived. However, as
                    humanities researchers continue to push their investigations of writing and
                    circulation into theories of complex networks and network culture, ongoing work
                    is needed to expand digital research methodologies beyond the scope provided by
                    rhetorical and pedagogical methods. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">This "potential" that Dobrin describes for
                    distinguishing between "micro and macro" approaches
                    to "complex ecological theories of writing" is the
                    basis for the following differential typology of iteration. Thus, we define the
                    microscopic approach in complex networks as attempting to understand individual
                    users within specific networks. This is what we refer to as the user-as-node
                    concept of network research. This reductive concept understands network behavior
                    as affecting the choices of the user within the network — often leading to
                    reductive cause/effect relationships between users and the information that
                    flows within a single network. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Alternately, the macroscopic approach attempts to understand aggregate activities
                    of groups of users across an interactive ecology of multiple interactive
                    networks. We see this as the environment that allows for Dobrin’s
                    hyper-circulation and network saturation. We know that most users, if not all,
                    interact within multiple networks of mediation. A single user, for example, will
                    watch television while writing on Twitter and posting images to Instagram with
                    their mobile phone, and monitoring Facebook on their laptop — one user, three
                    screens, and four networks. If we analyzed this particular <em class="emph">user</em>
                    only within Twitter, for example, then that user’s tweet about a particular
                    television show may appear to be motivated (caused) by another Twitter user who
                    previously tweeted about the same show, when, in the case of this example, the
                    tweet about the television show may have been motivated instead by a Facebook
                    post or by the show itself. Or, maybe the user received a text message from a
                    friend who was watching the show at the same time (a fifth network). The problem
                    with the user-as-node in a single network model is that it often ignores this
                    broader media ecology of multiple interactive networks, and it too easily allows
                    for simplistic cause/effect claims about circulation and determinate reductions
                    of agency. Accounting for users as nodes within complex ecologies may be
                    theoretically possible, but it is likely a pragmatic impossibility when
                    considering that any user’s actual position within multiple interactive networks
                    may be too indeterminate and ever-shifting to predict a future position.</div>

                        Systems Science </cite>defines complex systems as "systems that comprise many interacting parts with the
                            ability to generate a new quality of collective behavior through
                            self-organization, e.g. the spontaneous formation of temporal, spatial
                            or functional structures"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#meyers2009">Meyers 2009</a>, iii]. Individual social networks, like Twitter for example, certainly fulfill
                    the requirements for being defined as complex networks: "They are therefore adaptive as they evolve and may
                            contain self-driving feedback loops"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#meyers2009">Meyers 2009</a>, iii]. However, the user-as-node within Twitter (within a single complex
                    network) does not account for the cybernetic post-subject within a complex
                        writing <em class="term">ecology</em>. That is, the user-as-node model typically
                    focuses on a single user in a single network and cannot adequately account for
                    the information flow between networks. Complex ecologies of writing must work to
                    understand, as Dobrin explains, that "the whole of writing can never be explained by way of
                            its parts but instead through the properties of its
                            interconnectedness"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#dobrin2011">Dobrin 2011</a>, 144]. This does not mean that we do not look at parts and wholes, but we do so
                    with the theoretical understanding that complex networks are so dynamic and
                    ever-changing that there is no practical way to ever recreate a user’s
                    cybernetic position or to capture an all-encompassing macroscopic ecology. And
                    even if we could recreate or map that positioning, it would only represent
                    that single moment in time — a "pause in flow" as
                    Dobrin calls it — and it would likely tell us very little about that user’s
                    future position and attention. As the <cite class="title italic">Encyclopedia of
                        Complexity</cite> explains, "complex systems are much more than a sum of their
                            parts. Complex systems are often characterized as having extreme
                            sensitivity to initial conditions as well as emergent behavior that are
                            not readily predictable or even completely deterministic"

                    individual networks represents the microscopic perspective for media ecology,
                    the macroscopic perspective looks at how users are aggregated or moved by large
                    trends of information flow. In other words, the microscopic sees the user as
                    directing the flow (what is often thought of as agency), and the macroscopic
                    sees groups of users as following trends or hyper-circulation (being redirected
                    by the flow). Certainly, for writing studies and digital humanities scholars who
                    are interested in affecting audiences within a singular network, Diffusion of
                    Innovation theory applications for Twitter research (also applicable to other
                    individual networks) continue to produce useful models for understanding how
                    ideas circulate among specific social groups within an individual network (see,
                    for example, [<a class="ref" href="#lee2010">Lee, Kwak, Park, and Moon 2010</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#wu2011">Wu, Hofman, Mason, and Watts 2011</a>], [<a class="ref" href="#guille2012">Guille and Hacid 2012</a>]. However, the work forwarded in this article looks
                    for ways to begin moving beyond such microscopic studies, and start moving
                    toward macroscopic social network research in its own right (rather than merely
                    using macroscopic analyses to reinforce micro/user-as-node research).</div>

                    based on other fish around them, we can also learn about their movements by
                    watching the school as a whole. However, in terms of complex networks, no grand
                    unifying theory yet exists to account for the integrated operations between
                    micro and macro levels of research. We propose no grand unifying theory in this
                    article, but we also do not see the two as conflicting or contradictory. Much
                    effort and research in rhetoric and writing studies has been given to questions
                    of agency and individual users’ (writers) ability to direct the delivery of
                    writing — the theory of "rhetorical velocity" is a great example of this.
                    We see no inherent problem with microscopic research — it is important
                    pedagogical work, and it ought to continue. Rather, our research attempts to
                    make the macroscopic (large scale, aggregate) perspective of writing useful for
                    media ecology and writing studies as well: ours is an inclusive agenda, and an
                    attempt to expand the available methods for studying networked writing. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">The type of iteration at the core of our research is what is commonly called a
                        "trend." As mentioned above, trends identify large scale, aggregate
                    information flow. Trends occur within social media technologies when users
                    repeat similar words, or hashtags (#), over the same period of time, or when
                    large groupings of similar words or phrases iterate together. The period of time
                    and systems used to identify trends are always arbitrary. There is no positivist
                    basis or claims of capturing social reality forwarded by this research. Data
                    science, in many of its variations, may be understood as postmodern in the ways
                    it conducts its research — the scopes constructed are always folding back on
                    themselves, always limited by the self-identifying archives they create, and
                    always self-modified to tentatively answer exploratory questions. As Cary Wolfe
                    explains in <cite class="title italic">What is Posthumanism?</cite>, building on the
                    work of Niklas Luhmann, the combination of systems theory and Derridean theories
                    of writing provide the basis for "reconstruction"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#wolfe2009">Wolfe 2009</a>, 8]. While Wolfe’s work with critical animal studies takes a far different
                    trajectory than does our own research, the same underlying theory is applicable
                    to this study. The reconstruction of trend flow in this article — of macroscopic
                    information flow — is limited by the scope that allows or recreates its very
                    possibility. The acknowledgement and study of such limitations is what makes
                    data science — the operational methodology of measurement deployed in this
                    article — amenable for humanities scholars who have long theorized the
                    generative possibilities of the archive. </div>

                    data set. In addition, since tweets are often shared, linked, and tagged, the

                    order to determine how Twitter may be used for a variety of purposes and a
                    variety of users. For example, most research on Twitter falls into at least six
                    methods: content analysis, topic modeling, clustering, sentiment analysis,
                    opinion mining, and audience exposure analysis. Content analysis analyzes
                    Twitter for a variety of purposes, but mainly to research what users tweet and
                    for what purposes. Topic modeling looks for specific topics or conversations
                    which are then used to model other phenomena or events. For example, Michael J.
                    Paul and Mark Dredze have analyzed tweets related to public health and shown
                    that such data can provide quantitative correlations with public health data,
                    suggesting that Twitter can be applied to public health research [<a class="ref" href="#paul2011">Paul and Dredze 2011</a>]. Clustering provides a methodology for showing
                    relationships or natural groupings between Twitter users, hashtags, or specific
                    terms: who retweets or follows whom, how hashtags relate to each other, etc., in
                    order to show how information circulates on small scales and how users relate to
                    each other. Sentiment analysis [<a class="ref" href="#bifet2010">Bifet and Frank 2010</a>] attempts to determine
                    the feelings of users toward a particular story or subject, often toward ends
                    such as brand management. Relatedly, opinion mining attempts to search Twitter
                    for the opinions of users on particular topics, which may range across a
                    continuum on the level of emotion such opinions contain (in other words, some
                    opinions may be more measured or more reactionary). While such research can be
                    useful, it does little to show macroscopic trends across a network (or between
                    networks) as a whole. Coming closest to this study, audience exposure attempts
                    to determine the number of users who have seen an individual tweet. While the
                    number of times a tweet is retweeted is relatively easy to find, the number of
                    actual users who have viewed the tweet is not. Tom Emerson, Rishab Ghosh, and
                    Eddie Smith offer one method through their investigation into a tweet by the Bin
                    Laden Live Tweeter [<a class="ref" href="#emerson2012">Emerson et al. 2012</a>], but, again, such a method still
                    only accounts for a single tweet, a single user-as-node, and does not attempt
                    data analysis on the scale required to best understand hyper-circulation and how
                    the structure of the network as a whole (and its connections to other networks)

                    focused entirely on brand management and marketing research. This happens
                    primarily for two reasons: (1) it is common practice for social networks and
                    search engines to license their data for resale, providing an additional source

                    provides a specialized form of brand management and marketing research that
                    cannot be acquired elsewhere. While some of the current web applications that

                    data continues to be a significant gate-keeper for social network research, the
                    larger issues are the questions raised by the types of restrictions placed on

                    API allowed it to develop its primary photo sharing feature. APIs are useful in
                    that they can be re-purposed for social media research, using this access to
                    collect and analyze data on the network, its users, and the content circulated
                    therein.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Despite this accessibility, APIs are not beyond reproach for they subject the
                    researcher to their own limitations. We believe this trade-off results in a net
                    benefit for the academic investigator as the limitations are based more so on
                    bandwidth restrictions and less on prescribed end-uses for the data. Network
                    access through APIs is typically limited by the constraints of big data itself.
                    Put simply, existing network infrastructure cannot support unfettered access to
                    social network databases. Indeed, API functionality for large-scale services
                    like Twitter is often rolled out incrementally as internal engineers solve the
                    problems of big data one step ahead of users. The types of limitations created
                    by an API are different than the access issues, costs, and research limitations
                    of data types that are common to existing commerce and marketing tools. In other
                    words, APIs do not generally limit the kinds of data or what you can do with the
                    data, nor do APIs charge for data, but they do limit how often data access may
                    occur (because of bandwidth restrictions) and how much (or how far back in time)
                    data may be acquired each time an API is accessed. Anyone with the right
                    programming skills may access publicly available data through APIs, thus
                    eliminating the immediate cost barriers involved in using APIs. However, the
                    bandwidth restrictions do create access issues. For example, historical data
                    beyond a certain point in time may not be accessible with many social network
                    APIs, but if a researcher knows what they want to research ahead of time (i.e.,
                    they have pre-established a well-formed research question), then it is possible
                    to mine data on a regular basis and create a large historical archive over a
                    period of time. MassMine, as an open-source research tool created for academics,
                    allows such pre-determined archiving of data by providing full API data access
                    to users unaccustomed to programming low-level software solutions.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">The data collected for this study was pulled from Twitter’s API over seventy-four
                    days. Analysis and visualizations were conducted using both MassMine and the
                    open source R statistical computing language. During the period of time in which
                    we were pulling data from Twitter, we collected data on over 17,343 unique
                    trends, including the Christmas, New Year’s, and Valentine’s Day holidays, the
                    deaths of numerous celebrities and culturally significant figures, and Super
                    Bowl Forty-Eight. Our measures of interest in the rise and fall of trends across
                    geographic regions emphasized the need for temporal precision. MassMine was set
                    to retrieve and archive the top ten trends every five minutes from nine
                    different locations across the US, and an additional top ten trends for the
                    entire US as a whole. The choice of five minutes represents the maximum refresh
                    rate of Twitter’s trend data.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">Geolocation of information on our data was made possible via data filtering,
                    specified as Yahoo Where On Earth IDentifier (WOEID) codes, which allowed us to
                    track the location of trends across space and time. Twitter’s API allows for
                    trends to be identified as either (1) keywords specified as literal #hashtags
                    (for example: #superbowl) that are defined by users, or (2) trends that are
                    defined according to the most common phrases appearing in user statuses. We
                    decided to pull trends based on both, rather than limiting our analyses to
                    prescribed #hashtag trends. This approach ensured that we identified
                    organically-arising trends, in addition to more explicit #hashtag events.
                    Moreover, sometimes a singular trend may use multiple #hashtags. For example,
                    there were numerous #hashtags surrounding the death of Nelson Mandela (e.g.,
                    “Nelson Mandela”; “#MandelaMemorial”; “#NelsonMandela”; “Mandela”;
                    “#MandelaFuneral”), but Mandela’s death could be interpreted as a singular
                    trending topic. To be sure, both kinds of data were collected and jointly
                    analyzed.</div>

                    careful not to equate trends with attention. In fact, one of our current
                    limitations is that we are only looking at trends as they appear on Twitter.
                    Ideally, attention ecology would look at data from multiple social networks,
                    search trends from search engines, and other information that may help to
                    identify attention — such as data mining the tickers that appear at the bottom
                    of twenty-four hour news networks as a way of identifying what "news" is
                    given attention at various times of the day, looking at ratings numbers and
                    movie box office returns to get an idea of how entertainment events may be
                    accounted for, and certainly finding ways to understand how print media and oral
                    culture (word-of-mouth) continue to be a significant aspect of attention
                    ecology. There are potentially infinite ways of reconstructing an ecological
                    understanding of how attention may function with complex networks of mediation,
                    but when we account for place and time the problem becomes finite. It is in this
                    way that Twitter trends provide a useful starting point for understanding how to
                    attach the concept of attention to time and place. As more tools become
                    available to humanities researchers studying digital media and complex networks,
                    a broader macroscopic understanding of attention ecology will emerge.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">Our interpretation of the analysis is deliberately narrow for two reasons: first,
                    we are only accounting for trends within one particular network. Even though
                    Twitter has almost thirty-seven million active monthly users in the US, it is
                    unlikely that a significant number of those users restrict their use to Twitter
                    and do not acquire/circulate similar information through other networks. Second,
                    the temporal resolution of Twitter trends is necessarily fixed at some minimum
                    span (currently, five minutes), as defining trends tacitly implies aggregating
                    content across time. Further, within a unit of analysis repetition of content is
                    tabulated, with the ten most active topics selected as "trending" by
                    Twitter’s ranking algorithm. This means that a trend only becomes available for
                    data collection through API access once it has hit the top ten in a particular
                    location. Conceivably, it is reasonable to assume that many trends reside at the
                    eleventh or lower ranked position in numerous geographical locations before
                    being revealed in the top ten of a particular location. Therefore it is
                    problematic to understand the first appearance of a trend in Twitter’s system as
                    showing where a trend begins or which locations seem to be the most influential
                    in "causing" trends to "spread" to other locations. Another difficulty
                    can arise due to the magnification of the scope of analysis. That is, trends
                    that are initially below the level of detection at city-level could, in
                    aggregate, reveal their circulation at the national level before appearing on
                    any individual location’s top ten. This can occur, for example, when network
                    attention is broad and diffuse across a wide geographical region. Indeed, an
                    analysis of our own data revealed that over 29% of the trends that occurred in
                    all ten locations were identified at the national level first.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">Our collection efforts constituted samples of 10 trends for each of ten
                    geographical locations: Chicago, IL; Columbus, OH; Denver, CO; Houston, TX;
                    Jacksonville, FL; Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY; Seattle, WA; Washington D.C.;
                    and the United States. These locations were chosen because they were large
                    cities with good geographical and cultural spread. The sample trends in these
                    locations were identified every five minutes, for just over seventy-four days.
                    At 288 samples per day, this amounts to 288×74×10×10≈2,131,200 records. Because
                    trends are a spatial and temporal phenomenon, there is a great deal of
                    redundancy across regions and time spans of analysis. Table 1 describes the
                    breakdown of unique trends as identified across all samples. In total, 17,343
                    unique trends were observed across all locations, with decreasingly fewer topics
                    reaching trending levels at multiple locations. For example, 14.3% of trends
                    (2472) appeared in all ten locations. This 14.3% of trends is important because
                    these are the trends that appeared in the top ten trends of every single
                    location and the top ten trends of the broader US location, and thus can be more
                    confidently compared to one another.</div>

                    according to the number of locations at which individual trends were observed.
                    For example, the median duration of trends that appeared at only one location
                    across their entire lifespan was 0.08 hours (4.8 minutes), while trends that
                    were identified at all ten locations had a duration of 20.43 hours. While this
                    result might conform to reasonable expectations, it is not at all logically
                    necessary. All measures of central tendency suggest an overall increase in the
                    longevity of trending information corresponding to its geographic spread.
                    However, the effect of spread is small in all estimates, with the exception of
                    the mean, which is subject to large variations contingent on
                    uncharacteristically large or small values. Figure 1, which shows average
                    duration above the number of values used in each calculation, illustrates this.
                    Fluctuations in duration estimates for positions 8-10 move in tandem with
                    corresponding changes in the underlying counts, particularly for the mean.
                    Still, an increase in the lifespan of a trending topic commensurate with its
                    reiteration is fundamental to discussions and theories of virality. How then,
                    can observations regarding the behavior of trends — topics that, by definition,
                    are already popular within a network — lead to further understanding of the
                    mechanisms and conditions behind the rise and fall of viral trends? The
                    insensitive nature of our measure prohibits us from inferring the origin of
                    trends, both spatially and temporally. As discussed above, trends only reach a
                    level of identification after they’ve achieved top ten level popularity.</div>

                    possible to approach an analysis of trend circulation with those trends already
                    identified as such. The risk arises from including sparse trends, defined as
                    topics that appear in only a subset of measured locations. Such data cause
                    systematically biased estimates of trend location, duration, and genesis when
                    leveraging averaged, group-level investigations of this sort. For example, a
                    trending topic that persists for a long time only at the national level, but
                    never at city-based levels, can grossly underestimate its apparent geographical
                    spread, while simultaneously skewing the apparent duration of similarly grouped
                    trends with much shorter lifespans. Likewise, a social phenomenon linked to a
                    given city (e.g., trends unique to a state fair) that lasts for an extended
                    period may exaggerate its apparent value in the greater national or social
                    context.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">To avoid such pitfalls, we conducted an analysis on the subset of trend topics
                    that appeared, at some point in their lifespan, in all measured locations — nine
                    cities and at the national level. This ensured that trends were not
                    systematically binned for analysis based on geospatial restriction alone. Put
                    clearly, in the following analyses, all trends appear at each level of analysis.
                    This reduces the risk of spurious trend profiles due to uncharacteristically
                    short or long duration, and/or narrow or diffuse movements during recirculation
                    and reiteration. Duration distributions for these "ubiquitous" trends were
                    notably shifted toward a greater length of time, largely due to the removal of
                    single-instance trends that populated (11% of) the full data set. Median and
                    mean duration among ubiquitous trends was 20.43 hours and 327.25 hours,
                    respectively, compared to the corresponding duration of the full data set
                    (median = 0.50 hours; mean = 111.75 hours).</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">Figure 2 provides an overview of group-level ubiquitous trend duration as a
                    function of what we call geotemporal sequencing. Each curve corresponds to one
                    of the ten measured locations, with national-level data depicted in red. The
                    horizontal axis represents the temporal sequence, or order in which trends
                    appeared at a given location. For example, the first point on the red curve
                    depicts the average lifespan duration of trends that appeared first at the
                    national level before appearing at any other location. By contrast, trends
                    contained in the final point of the red curve were observed at every other
                    measured location before they appeared at the national level. Critically, by
                    restricting this analysis to so-called ubiquitous trends, which appeared at all
                    locations by definition, each curve in Figure 2 is composed of the exact same
                    data. The only difference is the order in which the data were grouped for
                    analysis. This approach ensures that our comparisons reflect underlying patterns
                    in recirculation/reiteration rather than artifacts of the particular data chosen
                    for analysis.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Several interesting patterns are revealed by the geotemporal sequencing results.
                    Most notably, the red curve (national-level trends) reveals a marked increase in
                    duration contingent upon when a trend appears at the national level. This result
                    is remarkably consistent across the entire geotemporal sequence. That is, trends
                    that begin their journey at the national level have the shortest overall
                    lifespan — shorter than trends beginning at every other city-level location (as
                    evidenced by the fact that all gray curves begin higher than the red curve).
                    Continuing along the red curve, a clear increase in duration is observed, one
                    that remains higher than all other locations after the fifth position in the
                    curve. Increase in mean duration as a function of order was found to have a
                    significant linear trend. The coefficient of order was estimated to be
                    approximately twenty-six hours (p &lt; .0002). Thus, in our data, each
                    additional shift to the right in the national-level curve reflected an increase
                    in staying-power of just over a day’s length. Put simply, the longer it takes a
                    trend to reach the national level, the longer that trend’s overall lifespan is
                    likely to last.</div>

                <div class="caption"><div class="label">Figure 2. </div>Geotemporal analysis of trend duration.</div></div>



                <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">This result mirrors the pattern observed in Table 2, and once again compliments
                    what common sense might predict. However, as previously mentioned, this result
                    is not a logical consequence of the analysis. Unlike Table 2, our geotemporal
                    analysis reveals why this is so. Consider the nine gray curves in Figure 2. Each
                    of the gray curves is composed of exactly the same data as the red curve.
                    Furthermore, points near the end of each curve reflect the averages of trends
                    that arrived late to each location. Applying similar logic to these data, we
                    might also suspect that average duration should increase commensurately with how
                    long it takes to reach each location. In other words, we would expect each curve
                    to have a slope &gt; 0. Instead, we find no systematic change in duration across
                    ordering for any city-level location (as evidenced by the relatively flat
                    curves). The only possible exception to this finding involves New York City
                    (NYC). Trends in our data that appeared first in NYC tended toward much longer
                    lifespans. A likely explanation for this is the disproportionately large
                    population of NYC, which establishes it as a cultural, technological, and social
                    juggernaut relative to our other locations. Regardless, the remainder of the
                    curve associated with NYC is flat and indistinguishable from our other cities,
                    and lies in stark contrast to the pattern observed at the national level.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">If each curve represents the same data, why do we observe such a striking
                    difference in the functional form of trend lifespans when our investigative lens
                    shifts from local city-level perspectives to a national one? The key to this
                    result lies in the effect of geotemporal order. By design, each trend included
                    in our analysis appears at all ten locations. However, it is entirely possible —
                    likely, even — that trends quickly spread and gain attention at multiple
                    locations, only to quickly diminish in popularity shortly thereafter. Indeed,
                    this is the predominate life-cycle of trends observed in our data. Most topics
                    quickly recede into obscurity — roughly 50% of the topics we measured
                    disappeared in less than 21 hours. Because all trends identified as such by
                    Twitter reflect topics receiving attention in social media, the question of
                    interest becomes what separates popular sentiment from so-called viral
                    trends?</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">Given the sheer number of active users and their tweets, virality can no longer
                    be defined according to raw counts. Rather, the hyper-circulatory nature of
                    viral information should reflect the underlying social attention itself, which
                    in turn can lead to reiteration and recirculation. A metric of attention would
                    ideally factor in activities and influences across multiple social networks,
                    news media, popular culture outlets such as television, podcasts, and radio, as
                    well as the impossible-to-measure aspects of interpersonal interactions between
                    users and their "real-life" friends and family. Despite the untenable
                    nature of such an analysis, we believe the geotemporal analysis provided here
                    gives us a glimpse into the nature of such hyper-circulating information. This
                    glimpse is reflected in the behavior of trends grouped according to their
                    appearance at the national level. Notice again that trends that appear first at
                    the national level do not particularly fair well from a sustainability
                    standpoint, relative to any other location. This observation holds for trends
                    that appear at the national level in position one through five of their
                    life-cycle. However, a tipping point occurs around position six, after which
                    trends generally persist for much greater periods of time. It is worth noting
                    that this striking increase holds for all metrics — mean, median, and geometric
                    mean — strongly indicating that this effect is not an artifact of measurement
                    alone (e.g., the effect is not due to random outliers). The effect is correlated
                    with the number of trends observed at each position in the geotemporal curve of
                    the national-level analysis (see Panel D of Figure 2). This reduction in the
                    number of trends should not be viewed as the cause of the increased durations
                    observed, but rather as a by-product of the mechanisms mediating the lifespan
                    pattern. Put simply, fewer trends are likely to achieve "viral" status, so
                    we should expect increasingly fewer observations as we move rightward along the
                    red curve.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">We are careful to not draw cause and effect conclusions, particularly given the
                    limited scope of our analysis. A future investigation might include monitoring a
                    greater number of city-level locations, as well as foreign locales. Nonetheless,
                    we speculate that this uptick in trend sustainability might reflect an
                    underlying change in the nature of the attention driving the mechanisms of
                    reiteration and recirculation. We refer to this critical mass as the "virality
                        threshold." At this point it is not possible to say with certainty what
                        "causes" topics to surpass the virality threshold, if such a notion is
                    even meaningful. One difference between "normal" trends and viral trends is
                    apparent though: trends that quickly rise to detectable levels at the national
                    level tend to be volatile in nature — quick to rise, and quick to fall. By
                    contrast, topics that bubble up slowly, growing and spreading across the country
                    in systemic fashion are much more likely to persist. The next logical question
                    then becomes what characterizes such topics in today’s world of ubiquitous
                    technology and information overload? We can only speculate, but we believe that
                    identifying such information will require simultaneous analysis of both inter-
                    and intra-network connectivity. For example, it is impossible to fully
                    understand hyper-circulation activity on Twitter without considering chatter on
                    Facebook, the news, television, etc. A look at Table 3 provides a tantalizing,
                    albeit anecdotal confirmation of our suspicions. In the left-most column we
                    report the twenty shortest-lived trends that made their first appearance at the
                    national level. The twenty trends listed in the second column represent the
                    topics with the longest lifespans, taken from those trends that made their tenth
                    and final appearance in our data at the national level. By contrast to the
                    shortest-lived trends, long-lived trends tend to center around celebrities and
                    corporate identities more likely to be circulating on more "controlled"
                    networks, such as television and news media. A more careful investigation into
                    the mechanisms dictating the nature of the virality threshold is left to future
                    research.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">As noted above, the results from this study suggest that the longer a trend takes
                    to reach a national audience, the longer that trend is likely to last.
                    Long-lasting trends tend to be slow and steady, systematically circulating from
                    city to city until finally reaching the national level, while trends that first
                    appear at the national level are more volatile and chaotic. To use a metaphor
                    often found in politics, trends that initiate from a "grass roots" level
                    (city-level rather than national level) have a greater potential to be sustained
                    over time. Or, to use another metaphor, a bottom-up approach lasts longer than
                    top-down, if we think of the "top" as national conversations driven by
                    celebrities, large-scale institutions, mass media, etc. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">If "rhetorical velocity" can be a practical tool of digital rhetorics, and
                    if velocity is defined in physics as "speed with direction," then this
                    study suggests that the goal that any user might want to achieve through digital
                    delivery is a direction with slow and steady speed. As much as digital
                    technologies are lauded (or cursed) for their ability to create near
                    instantaneous ubiquity, such high speed can be followed quickly by relative
                    obscurity.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">Such findings might also suggest that, like performance-based modes of delivery
                    through a human body, digital delivery requires a rhythm: it cannot simply rise
                    and crescendo forever, but works best when alternating between upbeats and
                    downbeats, perhaps picking up the pace from time to time, but slowly building
                    toward a chorus where multiple voices join in and tweet along. However, just as
                    not all trends are the same, not all "viruses" are the same, either. If
                    attention is in fact becoming a justification, in and of itself, then we need to
                    begin to better differentiate between kinds and types of attention — or, another
                    way to put it, we need to develop a differential typology of iteration. This
                    article suggests one type of differentiation by using the virality threshold to
                    tell the difference between normal trends, and trends that have become
                    viral.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">Specific to this study, there’s also a geographical component at play for how
                    trends might circulate — another possible form of differentiation. Although this
                    study didn’t look at the individual content of tweets beyond a trend analysis,
                    nor why one tweet might circulate from one location to another (only that they
                    circulated), future research might investigate the reasons why one trend might
                    move from one location to another. Animal studies describes one form of animal
                    navigation as "path integration," where an animal integrates continuous
                    path cues throughout its travels and uses them to navigate back to a starting
                    point. A theory of "trend integration" might be developed in order to track
                    the movement of trends and determine the various cues that help spread a trend
                    from one location to the next. However, given that animals use a variety of
                    senses to achieve path integration (inertial cues, proprioception, motor
                    efference, optic flow, and sensitivity to the earth’s magnetic field), and given
                    that social network activity occurs in a complex system, any practical attempt
                    to evaluate "trend integration" would require additional development in the
                    tools and techniques for studying social network trends. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">Such research would require an integration of the macroscopic (what we have
                    proposed here) with the microscopic. To return once again to our school of fish,
                    an ichthyologist can look at how fish behave individually, as a school, or how
                    these two levels operate together to create a whole, organized movement. Our
                    contention is that this kind of analysis <em class="emph">could</em> be done with
                    large-scale writing systems, but not at this time, for too little research has
                    looked at the macroscopic perspective to understand exactly how a whole school
                    of tweets moves. Even an individual fish (tweeter) cannot be abstracted into a
                    generalized higher-level operator (trend) without some sense of the larger
                    scale. We cannot integrate micro to macro until we first understand them
                    separately. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">As for our introduction of the term <em class="term">virality threshold</em>, we think
                    this concept, and others like it, are the first steps toward critical frameworks
                    for investigating how attention functions in network culture. If attention
                    itself, more so than the content of any trend, is the driving force of
                    hyper-circulation and network saturation, then we need to develop operational
                    methodologies for determining whether or not something actually is "viral."
                    If a digital object’s status as "trending" or "viral" is the basis for
                    developing narratives in news media and entertainment journalism, then it is
                    important to make sure other trends and viral topics are not being ignored —
                    especially ones attached to social movements and cultural critique. Eunsong Kim,
                    in the "Politics of Trending", reminds readers that "Trending is visibility granted by a closed, private
                            organization and their proprietary algorithms"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#kim2015">Kim 2015</a>]. Twitter’s system for locating and identifying trends, for example, is a
                    black box; Twitter does not explain how they quantify trends. Therefore, it may
                    be even more necessary to develop methodologies for showing that something is
                        <em class="emph">not</em> trending or viral — even though news media, advertising,
                    and marketing campaigns may try to start a trend by pretending it has already
                    gained momentum. If our research accomplishes nothing else, we hope it
                    encourages critical responses to the phrases "this is trending" or "this
                        is viral" with questions like: How do you know it was a trend or viral
                    topic? Within how <em class="emph">many</em> networks did this actually trend or become
                    viral? Is this an organic/grassroots trend, or has it been manufactured?</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">While the virality threshold opens the possibility of differentiating between
                    popular trends and those cultural artifacts that become viral in nature, much
                    future work is needed to determine how such differentiations may be investigated
                    operationally across multiple networks. Also, the question remains unanswered as
                    to whether virality is simply a case of attention garnered, or does the content
                    have a significant effect on which trends reach and surpass the virality
                    threshold? We think there is a tipping point when the content becomes less
                    important than the attention itself, but it is not clear whether that will ever
                    be predictable. This question is a new spin on the age-old form/content debate,
                    but in this case the form is a given typology of iteration and the content is
                    whatever text, topic, or digital/cultural artifact motivated a given trend in
                    the first place. This is not a classic chicken/egg problem, because without a
                    doubt a cultural artifact must be delivered to a network before it can gain
                    attention. Rather, the questions raised here are how does the content gain
                    attention <em class="emph">after</em> its initial delivery, how much of a role in
                    attention-gathering does content play, and/or does sizable attention itself
                    aggregate attention and play a far more significant role in what eventually
                    becomes viral? We offer no answers to these questions, but we hope this study
                    shows the possibility of using operational research methodologies to understand
                    macroscopic attention. Certainly, these questions will never have a final answer
                    — as networked culture and media ecologies are always dynamic, shifting, and
                    changing over time — but this does not mean that writing studies and the digital
                    humanities cannot expand the available methodologies for investigating these
                    questions and provide tentatively effective descriptions for how attention
                    functions. </div>
