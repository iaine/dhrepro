                <p>In the Digital Humanities, there is a fast-growing body of research that uses
                    data visualization to explore the structures of language. While new techniques
                    are proliferating they still fall short of offering whole language
                    experimentation. We provide a mathematical technique that maps words and symbols
                    to ordered unique numerical values, showing that this mapping is one-to-one and
                    onto. We demonstrate this technique through linear, planar, and volumetric
                    visualizations of data sets as large as the Oxford English Dictionary and as
                    small as a single poem. The visualizations of this space have been designed to
                    engage the viewer in the analogic practice of comparison already in use by
                    literary critics but on a scale inaccessible by other means. We studied our
                    visualization with expert participants from many fields including English
                    studies, Information Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, and Computer
                    Graphics. We present our findings from this study and discuss both the
                    criticisms and validations of our approach.</p>

                <h1 class="head">1 INTRODUCTION</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">One of the goals of the literary critic is to analyze language and its embedded
                    complexity. For example, when literary critics examine a poem’s form, they
                    consider many characteristics of the words it contains, including the
                    similarities and differences in orthography, sound, the visible pattern it
                    produces, rhythmic structure, and countless others. Nearly all of this
                    information is available through visual inspection of the poem and contained in
                    what may already be our greatest visualization technique — the written word.
                    However, this same inspection carries with it the biases introduced by the
                    semantic meanings of the words themselves: it is difficult to pay attention to
                    the structural parts of the word “apple” without imagining the fruit it
                    represents.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">One possible method of aiding in the process of literary criticism is to provide
                    an alternate representation [<a class="ref" href="#simon1988">Simon 1988</a>] of the words contained
                    within the text to help separate the meaning from the structure, or to provide a
                    different vantage point with which to examine the work. By providing this
                    alternate view, structural aspects of the poem that may be difficult to
                    recognize when obfuscated by the meaning of the words themselves may be easier
                    to analyze and observe. We caution that this understanding will likely not be
                    valuable unless a connection can be bridged between the alternate representation
                    and the original piece of literature, and we stress that this approach is to be
                    considered an augmentation to existing practices. The goal of the research
                    presented in this paper is to provide an information visualization that provides
                    alternate representations of literature that will allow the critic to recover
                    the original work for analogic purposes.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">There have been a variety of examples in the digital humanities and information
                    visualization disciplines that provide alternate representations of language,
                    such as Word Clouds [<a class="ref" href="#viegas2008">Viegas 2008</a>] and Word Trees [<a class="ref" href="#wattenberg2008">Wattenberg 2008</a>], but the authors are not aware of any examples
                    that have as a priority the ability to discern the text itself from the
                    visualization. Instead, these examples provide a means of examining text with
                    prior knowledge of the contents therein. Nonetheless, it is an open question
                    whether this change in representation would prove useful to the trained literary
                    critic.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In this paper, we present a design study of an information visualization that is
                    a recoverable representation of language. Specifically, we present the design of
                    a visualization we have named Language DNA (L-DNA) that visually encodes any
                    symbol system, in our case the letters and phonemes of words in the English
                    language, and a qualitative evaluation with several literary critics and
                    designers to investigate the need and use of such a visualization.</div>

                    ontologies of words based on the needs of the literary critic. Much work has
                    been done in the area of text visualization but none have yet approached a level
                    that can produce whole language interactions. Our work builds on previous text
                    visualization techniques while expanding on the scope of information that can be
                    shown in our system, Language DNA.</div>

                        visualization. Most approaches to text visualization whether coming from the
                        Information Visualization (InfoVis) community or the digital humanities, are
                        often aesthetically pleasing, but have not been demonstrated to have utility
                        for literary criticism or linguistics. This limitation can be seen in text

                            art?"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#frye2000">Frye 2000</a>] The development of the visualization technique presented here was driven
                    by this exact question. Our intention is to facilitate a different approach to
                    Frye’s domain-specific question about literary criticism: can we use
                    mathematical and visualization techniques to incorporate science into a literary
                    criticism? These questions have a long history in the humanities and were born
                    out of the general notion that arose in the renaissance when the likes of Locke,
                    Bacon, and Descartes defined a practice that separated and solidified science
                    from the humanities. The 20th century structuralists suggest that this position
                    is reconcilable, that all literature and language is systematic. This idea —
                    that language is systematic — is approachable via visualization.</div>

                    little as a single letter, as much as entire corpora. If we are to imagine a
                    space where the literary critic or linguist can experiment using a
                    language-based mathematics, it must have these three characteristics:</div>

                    <h2 class="head">3.1 Consistency and Reversibility</h2>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">First, a visualization algorithm is needed to encode language such that we
                        can create a space that is both consistent and reversible. In mathematical
                        terms, this would be referred to as one-to-one and onto. The need for
                        consistency and reversibility arises from the requirement in the analysis
                        process of preserving the ability for human interpretation of the words. In
                        order for the visualization to be “readable” by a critic, each word must be
                        consistently mapped and that mapping must be reversible into the original
                        work. Most existing visualization techniques distort the original texts
                        without providing an avenue for reconstituting them. This is problematic
                        when studying things like poetics where the spatial component of the text is
                        integral to its meaning.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Second, it is important that the algorithm uses a plotting space that is
                        infinite. Imagine that we were to approach the problem of metaphor. As an
                        example, in theory we do not know if the chain of meaning created by
                        metaphoric relations between words is finite. It stands to reason then, that
                        without an understanding of the full requirements of a system that an
                        infinite space is a safe decision. If we are to start to approach these
                        types of questions our lack of knowledge should not limit the size of
                        possibilities. Specifically, the critic must be able to analyze words and
                        literature that are perhaps not known to the visualization designer. With
                        our technique, we can encode anywhere from one letter to an entire language,
                        to the entire literatures of one language, and even multiple languages, in a
                        space where each point belongs to one individual piece of original
                        information. The infinite space means that in creating "experiments"
                        the literary critic is not limited to our present understanding of
                        language.</div>

                        to make comparisons. For instance, it should be possible to overlay a poem
                        within the context of the entire language or other poetry. The need for
                        layering arises from the analogic basis of most types of literary critical
                        and linguistic inquiries. This should extend to any types of symbols, as
                        comparisons are not always rooted in the Latin alphabet. Based on what we
                        recognize as the possible requirements of such a system, we designed our
                        Language DNA visualization with the three characteristics of consistency and

                    visual space. Mathematically, this requires that the mapping be a bijection
                    (i.e., that words both map to a unique place in the visual space, and that each
                    point in the visual space maps back to a word). As an example of the technique
                    we introduce a mathematical translation of words to numbers that relies on the
                    lexicographical ordering of letters. This is essentially a mapping of
                    alphabetical order and is one of possibly infinite ways to group the data. We
                    have chosen this technique as a first demonstration because we are all familiar
                    with the way we order a dictionary, but we must stress that we can map the data
                    many different ways. We define the mapping 𝑔 so that each letter is
                    mapped to its position in the alphabet, as follows:</div>

                    characters in the language), which for convenience we will symbolically

                        both of what is being visualized and the size of the resulting
                        visualization. We can base a visualization size calculation on the number of
                        words being visualized, and then determine the length of a 1D L-DNA
                        visualization that draws at a density of a single pixel for each word or
                        unit (it is important to remember that these calculations are for
                        orthography, they will change depending on the symbol system used). Two
                        measures are needed to accomplish this: the smallest and the largest
                        distance between two words. Since our algorithm already normalizes words in
                        1D to be between 0 and 1, we can assume that the difference between the
                        largest and smallest words is approximately 1.0 (with the words ‘a’ and
                        ‘zygote’, this is already correct to 1 decimal place). In our analysis of

                        possible to identify visual rhymes by cluster groups within the image. In
                        Fig. 11, this same phoneme visualization can be used to identify rhyming
                        patterns within a poem. As the phonemes group together it is possible to see
                        the types of sounds being repeated in the piece. Although this is easy to do
                        with a 16 line sonnet, it becomes much more difficult with a poem of any
                        significant length (e.g. Milton’s 10,000 + lines of verse in "Paradise Lost") and this technique could help to
                        highlight "macro-structures" in poetry. Each diagram below is laid out
                        in two dimensions. This is a decision made during the encoding process and
                        can be n-dimensional based on the amount of information you wish to build
                        into the model. In this case we have chosen to show 2d representations for
                        simplicity. In Figure 10 we present what we label our alphabetical order
                        visualization where we represent words by their spellings. A visualization
                        of spelling alone may not lead to many insights, but is useful for simple
                        demonstrations. One area where this simple encoding could be used would be
                        to visually compare irregular spellings in Elizabethan drama. It would
                        provide quick visual access to the places in texts that differed and needed
                        an editor’s attention. The real power in this method comes from being able
                        to encode as many connections as desired. Work has been done in the digital
                        humanities and computer science in the last few years in word embedding
                        models and the consistency of our method could aid in the process of
                        detecting connections in texts by using vectors. In figure 11, we have
                        graphed phonemes in two dimensions. Any highlights that form vertical lines
                        are showing alliteration in the poem. An example is in the line from Donne’s
                        poem: "Or like a thiefe, which till deaths doome be
                            read". The words "deaths" and "doom" line up vertically
                        to indicate alliteration in this particular encoding. If we wanted to
                        visualize rhymes we would simply encode the phonemes in reverse, privileging
                        the final phoneme and we would generate a similar graph. The n-dimensional
                        nature of the models allows for as much or as little data coding as needed,
                        including relations between words. The only limitations on the questions
                        that can be asked are the imagination of the analyst.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p77">77</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p77">In our interpretation of the study data, the questions about whitespace
                        (Q2-Q3) produced perhaps the most interesting results. It was during this
                        question that most of the participants began to hypothesize about the
                            "space" in the languages they use every day. Essentially the parts
                        of the visualization with an absence of marks inspired thought, because they
                        were in stark contrast to the actual dots drawn on the screen. This result
                        strongly indicates the analogic or comparative possibilities of this
                        technique — the literary critic can begin to understand what makes a word
                        English by recognizing what is not a word, or by investigating what words
                        poets or writers use that push the boundaries of language. This result is
                        encouraging for the domain-specific problems of literary criticism. One of
                        our requirements is a space for analogues and with the whitespace in this
                        simple mapping there is significant affect. The response of our participants
                        to the relationship between the whitespace and the space occupied by words
                        creates a relationship that gives insight into what sets of symbols we use
                        and which we do not use in our language. The sheer size of the whitespace in
                        comparison forces an understanding of how few of the possible arrangements
                        of letters we actually use. With further work we think it is possible to
                        show that more complex mappings will produce more complex analogues.</div>

                        particular, the most common criticism centered on making the technique
                        interactive, which is a clear (and previously planned) next step in our
                        iterative design process. Another criticism was that the encoding we used
                        was arbitrary, and its meaning was not immediately clear:</div>

                            two letters, and when you zoom in you’re seeing the space of subsequent
                            letters. I guess what this mapping is lacking is the Meaning of words,
                            or the semantics. They end up being distances from one another but … the
                            distance between related concepts, synonyms. I’m not necessarily saying
                            this is a bad visualization because of that. It just doesn’t encode the
                            meaning of words. Which is much harder. But, this is a legitimate way of

                        the white space proximity — they have similar vowel and consonant structures

                        communications are evolving is in instant messaging, text messaging, and
                        social media. It seems that for ease and speed, we can give up many letters
                        — chiefly the vowels — in words and still retain meaning. Fig. 15 shows MSN
                            "words" overlaid on the OED visualization. It is interesting to
                        note that many of the new "words" (marked with red dots), fall in the
                        spaces where very little or no words exist. This demonstrates that even in a
                        type of shorthand, like the one used in instant messaging (e.g., "btw",
                            "lol", "ttyl", etc.) that many of the newly created words are
                        spelled with letter combinations that simply don’t exist in the language.
                        This is partially a result of the volume of acronyms used in instant
                        messaging but it becomes obvious by "reading" the image that many of
                        the words used fall on the top line of each row suggesting (such as with row
                        A, and row I) that many of these "words" and acronyms begin with those
                        letters. In this way our technique produces visuals that allow us to ask

                        density map (Section 9.1) that allows zooming into the recursive letter
                        pairs. For example, it is possible to click or tap on the "BA" square,
                        then the "NA" square, then another "NA" square to then see the
                        word "BANANA" as shown in the static image of figure 3.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p111">111</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p111">In this paper we have introduced L-DNA and presented the findings of a
                    qualitative study of its design. In L-DNA, we have developed a mapping of symbol
                    systems to visual space, which we have demonstrated using language. Our
                    formulation has several properties that are valuable for the analysis of
                    language and are not available in some other common visualizations of language.
                    L-DNA has the following important features:</div>
                <div class="ptext"><ol class="list"><li class="item">The L-DNA space is capable of handling any symbol string from a null
                        string to a string of infinite length. L-DNA can be used in 1, 2, or n
                        dimensions.</li><li class="item">L-DNA space is infinite in that between any two points (words) in the
                        space there exists another word — though it may not have semantic
                        meaning.</li><li class="item">The L-DNA space is one-to-one and onto (bijective). Every unique coding
                        maps to a unique position and, in reverse, words (or any original
                        information) can be recovered uniquely from the visual space.</li></ol></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p112">112</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p112">We have mathematized language to make exploring and experimenting with language
                    easier, but the results of said experiments need to have the possibility of
                    being reversed out of the space to be able to assign meaning once again to the
                    language. We have also presented a qualitative study, which provided encouraging
                    results that indicate the power of the type of representation provided by L-DNA,
                    the benefit of the whitespace that it generates, and its possibilities to
                    provide inspiration (even if reluctantly), as well as some useful criticisms
                    that led to iterations in our design.</div>
