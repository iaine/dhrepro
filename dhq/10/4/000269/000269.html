                <p>Digital archives change more quickly than traditional ones: they are adaptable
                    and transient. This has advantages and disadvantages; digital archives can
                    disappear from sight almost instantly but they can also be easily safeguarded
                    and restored. Borrowing the critical vocabulary of performance studies, digital
                    archives could thus be understood as "repertoires" rather than traditional
                    archives. By treating digital archives as repertoires, this article explores
                    different threats and opportunities presented by their volatile nature and makes
                    policy and technical recommendations on how to ensure their relevance and
                    sustainability. </p>
            </div>
            
        
        
            <div class="div div0">
                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">"At the moment this archive is only a prototype, but we will soon have a
                        public version available online." I have heard – and pronounced –
                    these words in several occasions in digital humanities conferences and
                    presentations. Everyone seems to be building an archive, but these projects are
                    often archives in progress. And the most established archives also change often:
                    new versions, features and editions are constantly added. When you visit the
                    website of many archives, it is common to find features that are "not yet"
                    working or to read in the history of the archives about aspects of the archive
                    that were present in previous iterations of the projects. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">It is easy to condemn this situation. Traditional archivists could assert that
                    digital archives are not really built to endure the passage of time and
                    constitute a repository for future historical research. Therefore, the argument
                    goes, digital archives are not really archives. However, comparing digital with
                    non-digital archives obviates many of the specific ways in which digital
                    archives can be relevant and sustainable, two important objectives of every
                    archiving project. There are two complicating factors to an easy comparison with
                    non-digital archives:</div>
                <div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">The mutability of digital archives is complex. </li><li class="item">The lifespan of a digital archive is indeterminate. Any iteration of the
                        archive can disappear quickly, but it can also be reconstructed in ways that
                        are difficult – if not impossible – with brick and mortar archives. </li></ul></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">This article proposes to address these complications through the theoretical lens
                    of performance studies, a discipline that has long engaged in the theorization
                    of archives. In performance studies, the opposite of an archive is a repertoire.
                    And though there are fundamental differences between digital archives and
                    embodied performance repertoires, there are also striking similarities between
                    them. Looking at the way performance scholars conceptualize and study
                    repertoires, digital humanists can gain a strategic new vocabulary to describe
                    how digital archives work and, most importantly, think about ways to upkeep and
                    maintain the relevance of archives in the future. Before launching into a
                    performance studies approach, this article will briefly consider how the
                    differences between between digital and traditional archives have been
                    conceptualized earlier. This is a long and complex discussion, but several key
                    issues are constantly highlighted in the conceptualization of digital archives:
                    the possibility of new methodological approaches, the threat of the
                    disappearance of context, the new need for new technical models, the competing
                    claims of access and preservation, and the suitability of the word
                        "archive."
                </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Much has been said about the capacity for search-and-retrieve and data mining
                    operations allowed by digital archives. One of the key areas where these
                    techniques are already making great an impact is newspaper archives and the
                    historical research they enable. Newspaper archives are unique because of the
                    periodicity, abundance, and uniformity of their records; thus, they provide us
                    with an excellent case study for the impact of new methodologies for archival
                    research. According to Bob Nicholson, who writes about the impact of digital
                    archives in the study of newspapers, everything has been changed by
                    search-and-retrieve as well as data-mining algorithms which could not have been
                    applied to physical newspaper collections. New technologies are affecting a
                    broad range of questions, whether it is to study the lives of individuals,
                    explore changes in the usage of language, track the development and circulation
                    of ideas, or write the history of a serialized publication: <blockquote><p>Digital methodologies promise to have a significant impact
                            on multiple areas of historical research. We are potentially on the cusp
                            of a [...] revolution, a ‘digital turn’ in humanities scholarship driven
                            by the creative use of online archives and a willingness to imagine new
                            kinds of research. [<a class="ref" href="#nicholson2013">Nicholson 2013</a>, 63]</p></blockquote></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Archives dealing with literature, theatre and other arts are usually not as
                    uniform or as extensive as newspaper archives. Nevertheless, different ways of
                    interrogating archives are also changing the ways all kinds of digital archives
                    are conceptualized and used. Another concern often brought up in discussions
                    about digital archives is the disappearance of context. Discussing 19th century
                    newspaper and literature archives, Shafquat Towheed remarks that the context of
                    reading was different in the 19th century and the specificity of reading is
                    difficult to reconstruct from digital collections, since they generally lack
                    annotations and marginalia. Another problems is that items are not bundled
                    together, which makes the practice of browsing through the materials cumbersome:
                            <blockquote><p>Paradoxically, while the digitization of
                            nineteenth-century newspapers means that they have never been more
                            widely available, the very experience of casually browsing through the
                            pages of an essentially disposable publication has become increasingly
                            remote and difficult to reconstruct. [<a class="ref" href="#towheed2010">Towheed 2010</a>, 142]</p></blockquote></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Computer scientists are also trying to come to grips with the different
                    conceptual model required by digital archives, as opposed to that of digital
                    libraries or other kinds of collections. Following Stefano Vitali, Nicola Ferro
                    and Ginamaria Silvelo suggest that the most distinctive characteristic of
                    digital archives is that they are held together by an <em class="term">archival
                    bond</em>: there is a specific, homogeneous and often serialized way in which
                    items in a collection are organized and related to one another. Ferro and
                    Silvelo propose a formal model to address these issues, NEsted SeTs for Object
                    hieRarchies (NESTOR) [<a class="ref" href="#ferro2013">Ferro and Silvelo, 2013</a>]. However, the development of
                    information organization models is still an open question and there are
                    currently no standards to be widely adopted. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Another challenge of digital archives refers to the competing claims of access
                    and preservation. Should an archive emphasize the widest range of materials
                    possible? Or should it make sure that a smaller collection is properly
                    documented, annotated, and made accessible to non-specialists? Different
                    archives have different philosophies on this matter, but, as Michelle Warren
                    notes, every cultural record, including books, is shaped by this competing
                    claims: <blockquote><p>The effort to preserve and the desire for
                            access have both changed the text now recorded. Together, preservation
                            and access make archives malleable and dynamic rather than
                            static. [<a class="ref" href="#warren2014">Warren 2014</a>, 170]</p></blockquote></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Another key concern is the suitability of the word <em class="term">archive</em>. Kenneth
                    M. Price looks at different words that are used in digital humanities work:
                    edition, project, database, archive, and thematic research collection, before
                    suggesting a new potential term: arsenal. When discussing all of these terms, he
                    stresses the importance of the choice of words and also notes the advantages and
                    limitations of all the possible choices. His characterization of digital
                    archives is particularly insightful: <blockquote><p>In a digital
                            environment, archive has gradually come to mean a purposeful collection
                            of surrogates. As we know, meanings change over time, and archive in a
                            digital context has come to suggest something that blends features of
                            editing and archiving. To meld features of both — to have the care of
                            treatment and annotation of an edition and the inclusiveness of an
                            archive — is one of the tendencies of recent work in electronic
                            editing. [<a class="ref" href="#price2009">Price 2009</a>]</p></blockquote></div>

                    and suggest new concepts – that can help us understand the constraints and
                    possibilities of digital archiving. All of the issues mentioned above can be
                    traced to the dynamic, changing nature of archives. Although this dynamism is
                    often mentioned, I argue that the particular way in which digital archives are
                    dynamic demands further attention. Based on the terminology of theatre studies
                    and my own experiences working with digital archives, I propose two new terms:
                        <em class="term">internal dynamism</em> and <em class="term">external dynamism</em> in order
                    to qualify the ways that digital archives change.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Having described the complex nature of digital archives, I suggest that
                    performance studies can offer a new way of understanding the connection between
                    archives, memory and knowledge. Performance studies conceptualize archives in
                    two major ways: as a metaphor and as a problematic source of historical
                    knowledge about performance practices. Metaphorically, the archive represents
                    the way in which certain theater makers work. For example, Mike Frangos argues
                    that Samuel Beckett's plays are archival in the sense that they enact, in form
                    as well as in content, the main concerns of archiving: historicity, repetition,
                    memory, and erasure [<a class="ref" href="#frangos2012">Frangos 2012</a>, 217]. This claim is
                    similar to that of Kenneth M. Price, who argues that the work of Walt Whitman
                    was developed, metaphorically, as a database. Whitman constantly republished
                    Leaves of Grass, rearranging verses drawn from a vast personal repository: "his storehouse of poetic lines, in both manuscript and
                            print, was his working database for future compositions"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#price2009">Price 2009</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">The archive can also be a metaphor that stands in for <em class="emph">any</em> theatre
                    performance. In this sense, theatre is always a living, evolving archive where
                    things are changed as they are stored and retrieved. Marvin Carlson describes
                    theatre as a place where <em class="term">ghosting</em> occurs. By this he means that
                    everything in the theatre has been "used before". The same bodies of the
                    actors have interpreted other roles, the same words have been spoken and the
                    same objects have been used to convey other meanings [<a class="ref" href="#carlson2003">Carlson 2003</a>]. Following the example of theatre studies, every aspect of cultural
                    production – anything and everything in a digital humanities archive – could be
                    understood in terms of archival metaphors and ghosting. As Jones et al. assert:
                            <blockquote><p>Arguably, all archiving is performance: records
                            are surrogates that provide a window onto past moments that can never be
                            recreated, and users interact with these records in a performance to
                            reinterpret this past. [<a class="ref" href="#jones2009">Jones et al. 2009</a>, 166]</p></blockquote></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p15">15</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p15">However, a more interesting avenue comes from the second conceptualization of
                    archiving in performance studies, where archives – in a more conventional sense
                    of the word – are seen as the problematic repositories of theatrical items:
                    photographs, booklets, recordings, technical scripts, and interviews. Whether
                    these items are ephemera or documentation records, they are problematic in the
                    sense that they are <em class="emph">not</em> performances. A film archive will contain
                    the films, and a literary archive will contain manuscripts. But a theatre
                    archive will never contain theatre performances. Theorists of theatrical
                    archiving have thus always dealt with a pressing concern of digital archives:
                    the fact that the items in a collection are not the "real" things but mere
                    surrogates, data, and traces. Peggy Phelan has famously argued that "performance becomes itself through disappearance" and
                    that the records of a performance can never be equivalent to the performance
                    itself: <blockquote><p>Performance's only life is in the present.
                            Performance cannot be saved, recorded, documented, or otherwise
                            participate in the circulation of representations <em class="emph">of</em>
                            representations: once it does so, it becomes something other than
                            performance. To the degree that performance attempts to enter the
                            economy of reproduction it betrays and lessens the promise of its own
                            ontology. [<a class="ref" href="#phelan1993">Phelan 1993</a>, 146]</p></blockquote></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">This argument has been contested by Phillip Auslander, who argues that
                    performance and meditaized recordings cannot be distinguished on an ontological
                    basis: <blockquote><p>Mediatized forms like film and video can be
                            shown to have the same ontological characteristic as live performance,
                            and live performance can be used in ways indistinguishable from the uses
                            generally associated with mediatized forms. Therefore, ontological
                            analysis does not provide a basis for privileging live performance as an
                            oppositional discourse. [<a class="ref" href="#auslander1999">Auslander 1999</a>, 184]</p></blockquote></div>

                    this controversy and labels it a "dated"
                    disagreement, suggesting that history has sided with Auslander and confessing to
                    a "tacit acceptance of Auslander's argument" that the
                    live is already mediatized "in the contemporary moment of globalized
                            technology"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#parker-starbuck2011">Parker-Starbuck 2011</a>, 9]. Nevertheless, the argument brought forth by Phelan still stands and
                    should still be relevant to digital archivists. Even if the "mediatized" is
                    now irremediably part of the "live", there is still an ontological
                    difference between a live performance and a record of that performance. This
                    difference might not grant a political superiority to one of them (as Phelan
                    expected), but it should still inform the efforts of digital archivists. It is
                    important for us to recognize the differences between the digital surrogates in
                    an archive and the original sources. This necessarily calls for specific
                    practices of contextualization, such as explaining how the records were made and
                    what gaps are present in a documentation project. </div>

                    another mode of transmission through time and space, the repertoire. The
                    repertoire is an archive of the body and of oral knowledge. The differences
                    betweens both modes of transmission have been thoroughly explored by Diana
                    Taylor in the landmark <cite class="title italic">The Archive and the
                        Repertoire</cite>. Consider, for example, the way in which she describes
                    archival memory: <blockquote><p>Archival memory works across distance,
                            over time and space […] what changes over time is the value, meaning or
                            relevance of the archive. Insofar as it constitutes materials that seem
                            to endure, the archive exceeds the live. [<a class="ref" href="#taylor2003">Taylor 2003</a>, 19]</p></blockquote></div>

                            non-reproducible knowledge. The repertoire requires presence; people
                            participate in the production and reproduction of knowledge by "being
                                there", being a part of the transmission [...] The repertoire
                                both keeps and transforms choreographies of meaning. [<a class="ref" href="#taylor2003">Taylor 2003</a>, 20]</p></blockquote></div>

                    and space – digital archives are no different from conventional ones. However,
                    as Jones et al. notice, code-based archiving does require interaction and the
                    presence of the users: <blockquote><p>Digital records are inherently
                            performative, only coming into existence when the correct code executes
                            the data to render a meaningful output. [<a class="ref" href="#jones2009">Jones et al. 2009</a>, 170]</p></blockquote></div>

                    upon, digital archives don't embody ephemeral knowledge that requires
                    co-presence. They require interaction but not the embodied co-presence of
                    producers and consumers of meaning. Digital archives do behave as repertoires in
                    that they are constantly evolving and they also keep and transform "choreographies of meaning", in Taylor's evocative
                    phrasing. This article suggests that there are two ways in which this similarity
                    with repertoires is manifested: constant change that is driven by improvisation
                    and the possibility of embedding the items of the repertoire in entirely new

                    to the "continuous beta" status of many digital archives; and the second,
                    to the potential to embed archival content in new settings through iframes and
                        APIs.<a class="noteRef" href="#d40073e410">[1]</a> These characteristics correspond to two kinds
                    of dynamism, which I propose to call <em class="term">internal</em> and
                        <em class="term">external</em>. Internal dynamism is the capacity of a repertoire or
                    digital archive to change constantly, as result of interactions, changes in the
                    people working on it, and the conditions affecting audiences and funding. The
                    external dynamism refers to the fact that the same material can be presented in
                    a variety of settings. For example, the same performance could be presented as a
                    ritual and as an international entertainment in different stages, as it happens
                    with some Balinese dance performances. In the case of a digital archive, the
                    same content could be presented on its website, or, if the encoded XML is
                    downloaded or served by an API, under a different interface. I use the term
                        <em class="term">dynamism</em> in the following sections, but this term could also be
                    considered as <em class="term">instability</em> or <em class="term">adaptability</em>, depending
                    on whether we want to emphasize the positive or the negative aspects of this
                    constant change. Dynamism is not necessarily more neutral, but it is a common
                    term and I will use it to stress both the positive and negative aspects of this
                    propensity to change. </div>

                        Flash and into JavaScript since Flash is heavy, does not scale well, and is
                        difficult to adapt to responsive environments.<a class="noteRef" href="#d40073e511">[6]</a> This is just an
                        example of the rapid technological change that archival projects need to

                    traditional archive. There is also less experimentation and "hacking" in
                    the development of traditional archives and the disappearance of traditional
                    archives can be more definite than that of digital ones. A digital archive can
                    be reconstructed, if it is properly documented (more about this later, in the
                    recommendations). A brick and mortar archive, by contrast, often disappears in
                    dramatic ways. A tragic example of this was the destruction of the Cologne city
                    archives, the result of a structural collapse where two people lost their lives
                    in March 3, 2009 [<a class="ref" href="#curry2009">Curry 2009</a>]. It is estimated that 90% of the
                    municipal archives of the City of Cologne, which date back to the middle ages,
                    were destroyed by a collapse that was likely caused by the construction of a new
                    subway station in the neighborhood. And, as a counter example, we can find the
                    digital data stored in the hard drives destroyed by another tragic event, the
                    9/11 attacks. As Matthew Kirschenbaum notes, a German firm was able to restore
                    the data from the ruins of the collapsed buildings [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>, xii]. </div>

                    inaccessible or, in Tim Maly’s term, they become "dark
                        archives." A dark archive is a collection of materials that exists
                    but is unavailable for general access [<a class="ref" href="#maly2013">Maly 2013</a>]. Crucially,
                    though, digital archives can move in and out of this darkness, they can be kept

                    consider archives' potential for "external" change. Digital archives can be
                    embedded in a different environment. This is almost impossible to do with a
                    brick and mortar archive. But sections, or the entirety of an archive, can be
                    reconstructed in an entirely different situation. </div>

                    British director Peter Brook, for instance, recounts an instance where the same
                    performance of <span class="foreign i">ta'ziyah</span> in Iran took on
                    completely different meanings, depending on whether it was performed at a
                    village or at an international festival venue [<a class="ref" href="#brook1968">Brook 1968</a>, 16–18]. In digital archives, this capacity for the same content to be
                    presented in different contexts is exacerbated by the quality of new media that
                    Lev Manovich identifies as transcoding. This means that media can be
                    transformed, converted, remixed, and inserted into other contexts [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2001">Manovich 2001</a>, 45–47].</div>

                <div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item"><span class="hi bold">Interactivity.</span> A digital archive can react to the
                        user in extremely dynamic ways. Depending on how the archive is created, a
                        user can effectively create her own sub-selection of archive materials. For
                        example, the A|S|I|A website allows users to bookmark portions of any video
                        and create their own annotated collection of video clips. </li><li class="item"><span class="hi bold">Extensibility.</span> Many archives also allow users to
                        reuse the contents of the archive in another setting. The Perseus Digital
                        Library, for instance, allows users to download XML encoded version of all
                        its documents.<a class="noteRef" href="#d40073e578">[7]</a> Some video
                        archives, following YouTube, allow users to embed items from their
                        collections in other websites. In the Contemporary Wayang Archive (CWA), we
                        are developing a function to allow exactly this. Users will be able to
                        bookmark any section of any of the videos and then embed this (via an
                        iframe) into any other website.<a class="noteRef" href="#d40073e584">[8]</a> Along the
                        same lines, APIs could easily be developed to allow users to transform and

                        of the archive. The Indonesian Cultural Archive Network (JABN – Jaringan

                        to re-utilize the materials of the five archives that constitute the
                        network. For example, people have used the digital texts as parts of live

                    Two new concepts, internal and external dynamism, have also been proposed to
                    offer a more granular vocabulary to describe transience in digital archives. The
                    next two sections look at the ways that practices from open source communities

                    and curving their extremely unstable nature: aiming for well documented open

                            a drop of water from drying up?" The answer, learned after long
                        travails, is easy, beautiful, and difficultly counter-intuitive: "By throwing it into the sea." Although there are
                        several problems to the applicability of this philosophy to digital
                        archiving, it does seem that opening up the source code and sharing the
                        collection is the best way to ensure two things: the archives' continuity in
                        many different platforms and the possibility of "reconstructing" the
                        archives later, in other platforms. The LOCKSS acronym – Lots of Copies Keep
                        Stuff Safe – is well known in the computer world [<a class="ref" href="#diorio2011">D'Iorio and Barbera 2011</a>, 66].<a class="noteRef" href="#d40073e624">[10]</a> Ensuring that many places can
                        legally posses copies of the source code will make the code survive. This
                        might seem like a Faustian bargain to some, but openly sharing is the best
                        safeguard against the disappearance of digital archives.</div>
