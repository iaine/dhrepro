                <p>The art history domain is an interesting case for search engines tailored to the
                    digital humanities, because the domain involves different types of sources
                    (primary and secondary; text and images). One example of an art history search
                    engine is RemBench, which provides access to information in four different
                    databases related to the life and works of Rembrandt van Rijn. In the current
                    paper, RemBench serves as a case to (1) discover the requirements for a search
                    engine that is geared towards the art history domain and (2) make
                    recommendations for the design of user observation studies for evaluating the
                    usability of a search engine in the art history domain, and in digital
                    humanities at large.</p>
                <p>A user observation study with nine participants confirms that the combination of
                    different source types is crucial in the art history domain. With respect to the
                    user interface, both free-text search and facet filtering are actively used by
                    the observed participants but we observe strong individual preferences. Our key
                    recommendation for specialized search engines is the use of faceted search (free
                    text search combined with filtering) in combination with federated search
                    (combining multiple resources behind one interface). In addition, the user study
                    shows that the usability of domain-specific search engines can successfully be
                    evaluated using a thinking-aloud protocol with a small number of participants.

                <h1 class="head">1. Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">For the interpretation of works of art, art historians study these works along
                    with different types of textual sources: primary documents describing the works
                    of art, their maker, the patron, the provenance, etc., but also contemporary
                    documents related to the social and economic context in which the artist worked,
                    and secondary literature. The information about works of art, both as primary
                    and secondary documents, can be found independently in digital (and in part also
                    non-digital) resources produced by museums, archives and libraries. Increasing
                    amounts of sources residing in libraries and archives are digitized and made
                    accessible online [<a class="ref" href="#rodriguez2013">Rodríguez Ortega 2013</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">In a previous project ("RemDoc") we developed a
                    digital collection of primary documents that relate to the life and works of
                    Rembrandt van Rijn (1606-1669). These documents had partly been published before
                    in the form of books [<a class="ref" href="#strauss1979">Strauss and van der Meulen 1979</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#roscam2006">Roscam Abbing 2006</a>]. In the Rembrandt Documents ("RemDoc") project we digitized them, added metadata, and made them
                    available through an online search engine.<a class="noteRef" href="#d677e238">[1]</a> Digital collections such as RemDoc form a pivotal tool for the research
                    of art historians: they serve as the entry point for and guidance in research
                    projects. However, for many of the research questions faced by Rembrandt
                    researchers, often other sources than primary documents are needed. Here are a
                    few examples of questions that might be asked by Rembrandt researchers:</div>
                <div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Was Rembrandt’s "Reading Woman" in the
                        Rijksmuseum painted on canvas or panel?</li><li class="item">Did Rembrandt paint dogs?</li><li class="item">How old was Titus when he died?</li><li class="item">Where is Rembrandt’s "Storm on the Sea of
                            Galilee"?</li><li class="item">Find etchings after Rembrandt’s self portraits</li></ul></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">To answer these questions, researchers need to combine diverse and geographically
                    distributed sources of information: text, images, and bibliographical data.
                    Probably the most consulted resources for art historical information on the
                    topic of Rembrandt are the databases of the Netherlands Institute for Art
                    History (RKD). The database RKDimages contains descriptions and images of mainly
                    Dutch paintings, drawings, prints and original photos before 1940; the database
                    RKDartists contains biographical information about Dutch and foreign artists of
                    the middle ages to the present. For Rembrandt research, the RKD databases are an
                    important reference. In addition, secondary literature stored in libraries is
                    relevant for art history research. The dispersed nature of relevant resources in
                    the Rembrandt research domain motivated us to design and develop an online work
                    environment that integrates these resources. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">This resulted in the development of RemBench.<a class="noteRef" href="#d677e275">[2]</a> RemBench provides access to information related to the life and works of
                    Rembrandt van Rijn stored in four different databases: RemDoc, RKDimages,
                    RKDartists, and a university library catalogue. These databases are made
                    accessible through a single search interface. The target user groups of RemBench
                    are art historians, historians, and other humanities scholars and students who
                    are interested in Rembrandt’s period, the 17<span class="hi superscript">th</span>
                    century. The goal of the RemBench project was to show the value of online
                    digital data for art history research. We defined two sub-goals: (1) to connect
                    the metadata of four different databases and (2) to build a demonstrator search
                    interface to these databases. The focus of the current paper is on the
                    development and evaluation of a search interface that gives access to the four
                    databases.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Access to the four different databases is realized through <em class="term">federated
                        search</em>. Federated search (sometimes called <em class="term">distributed
                        information retrieval</em>) is a technique for searching multiple
                    collections simultaneously with a single query. The results returned by the
                    selected collections are integrated into a single result page [<a class="ref" href="#jasco2004">Jascó 2004</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#shokouhi2011">Shokouhi and Si 2011</a>]. Federated search is often used in online library
                    services that give access to publications stored in multiple different
                    repositories, but most people also know it from the use of Google, where one
                    query often generates results from Google images, Google maps and the textual
                    Google index. In the terminology of federated search, the different resources
                    are called <em class="term">verticals.</em></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Because of the importance of metadata for searching in the art history domain
                        [<a class="ref" href="#bates1996a">Bates 1996a</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#yee2003">Yee, Swearingen, Li, and Hearst 2003</a>], we decided that RemBench should not only allow for
                    free text search, but also for filtering metadata values. For example, filtering
                    on location can help find works of art that are stored in Moscow; filtering on
                    document type can help find birth certificates, and filtering on date can help
                    find documents from before 1700. The search engine technology that combines free
                    text search with filtering for metadata values is called <em class="term">faceted search </em>
                    [<a class="ref" href="#tunkelang2009">Tunkelang 2009</a>]. Faceted search is commonly used in web shops,
                    booking sites and review sites, where users can select options for the items
                    they are searching for. Figure 1 shows the faceted search interface of RemBench.
                    RemBench will be described in more detail in Section 3. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">For the development and evaluation of domain-specific search engines, it is
                    important to know the information-seeking behaviour of the target group [<a class="ref" href="#gossen2013">Gossen, Hempel, and Nürnberger 2013</a>]: what type of queries do they phrase given a research
                    question, how do they formulate follow-up queries, and how do they decide which
                    results are relevant? However, these behaviours are to a large extent determined
                    by the functionality and usability of the search system at hand. At the same
                    time, the satisfaction of a user group with a search system depends on the match
                    between the functionality and design of the system and the goals of the users.
                    This interaction makes it difficult to disentangle information-seeking behaviour
                    and the requirements that a search engine should meet. It is therefore crucial
                    to observe the target group in interaction with a search engine in order to

                        humanities scholars, conducted over a two-year period. Complete logs of the
                        searches and output were captured, and a small number of scholars were
                        interviewed in depth. Based on these interviews, it is argued [<a class="ref" href="#bates1994">Bates, Wilde, and Siegfried 1994</a>] that humanities scholars have different needs than
                        researchers from other fields, because (a) publications in the humanities
                        are not so much about fact discovery, but more about the author’s opinions,
                        and (b) humanities scholars use very different terms than researchers in
                        other fields to describe the information they need. However, the study was
                        conducted in a time when web-based search engines were still in their
                        infancy, which might mean that the reported behaviour [<a class="ref" href="#siegfried1993">Siegfried, Bates, and Wilde  1993</a>] may not be representative of current
                        information seeking behaviour. Nevertheless, some of the recommendations
                        made in the final report [<a class="ref" href="#bates1996a">Bates 1996a</a>] still hold, such as the
                        recommendation to combine multiple databases in one search engine, and to
                        enable faceted search: <blockquote><p>

                                online database searching in the humanities may actually be harder

                        shows that the use of Google is the least frequent for humanities students,

                        is the highest compared to other fields. This may be explained by the
                        importance of primary sources for the humanities, which often reside in

                        collection of 35,000 fine arts images, using a faceted interface for
                        metadata filtering. They find that for these data, 90% of the participants
                        preferred the metadata approach over a free-text search functionality,
                        despite the fact that the latter was more familiar to them. This was likely
                        due to the nature of the data: images cannot easily be disclosed through
                        free text search. Metadata can disclose images, but the user then depends on
                        the terms chosen by the developers of the database for labelling the images.
                        If there is a mismatch (or the users suspect a mismatch) between the terms
                        in the database and the terms they would use themselves, metadata filtering
                        is a better option than free-text search, because selecting the most likely
                        (best matching) term(s) from a list is more effective than guessing query

                        important that usability is evaluated properly. The most-used method for
                        usability testing is to have users from the target group work with the
                        software or website, and ask them to provide feedback on the usability. With

                        proportion of additional usability problems found when adding test users
                        quickly decreases beyond five users. A common method for registering user
                        feedback is <em class="term">thinking aloud</em>. Van Waes [<a class="ref" href="#vanwaes2000">Van Waes 2000</a>] found that for usability testing of web applications, the combination of
                        thinking aloud with recording of the navigation process is a valuable
                        observation method, "to collect data about various usability aspects,

                        using the search engine at hand. Afterwards, the users are presented with a
                        questionnaire in order to assess their satisfaction with the system [<a class="ref" href="#spink2002">Spink 2002</a>]. This latter method of usability testing is

                            at the query itself. These results suggest that facets are important for

                    RKDimages, two art historical databases maintained by the Netherlands Institute
                    for Art History (RKD)<a class="noteRef" href="#d677e521">[3]</a>. RKDartists is a database of biographical information about Dutch and
                    foreign artists from the middle ages to the present day. RKDimages is a database
                    with descriptions and images of mainly Dutch paintings, drawings, prints and
                    original photos from before the Second World War. For RemBench, a selection of
                    records from the RKD databases was made that only includes artists and images
                    that are related to Rembrandt van Rijn. The starting point for this selection
                    was the record of Rembrandt himself in RKDartists. In the selection of artists,
                    all artists were included that are mentioned in the Rembrandt record (either as
                        "pupil of", "teacher of", "followed by", "influenced by"
                    or "had influence on"). In the selection of images, all works of art from
                    RKDimages were included that have been created by one of the artists in the
                    artist selection. The resulting selection consists of 1,857 works of art and 59
                    artists. </div>

                    digital collection of primary documents that relate to the life and works of
                    Rembrandt van Rijn. In the RemDoc project, all known documents have been
                    collected and disclosed that relate to Rembrandt, as a person and as an artist,
                    as well as to his ancestors, family, offspring and business partners, from the
                    15th to 18th centuries. The database contains 2,003 documents. Since all these
                    are related to Rembrandt, all were included in RemBench.</div>

                    search system that provides access to the full collection of the Radboud

                    databases were connected by mapping them onto one common metadata scheme.
                    Second, a search engine was developed to disclose the data in these databases.
                    The technology for faceted search and free text search that allows the user to
                    search all databases at once was developed by the Huygens Institute for the
                    History of the Netherlands using Apache Solr.<a class="noteRef" href="#d677e565">[6]</a> The four databases were treated as four separate verticals in the
                    interface, not merging the results in one result list. The main reason for that
                    decision came from the art historians in the research team: They argued that
                    four different groups of results would be more clear to the user. By doing so,
                    the challenge of ranking the results from the different verticals relative to
                    each other [<a class="ref" href="#ponnuswami2011">Ponnuswami, Pattabiraman, Wu, Gilad-Bachrach, and Kanungo 2011</a>] was avoided. In the user interface,
                    the verticals are labelled "Works of art" (group of results from
                    RKDimages), "Artists" (group of results from RKDartists), "Primary
                        Sources" (group of results from RemDoc), and "Library Sources"
                    (group of results from RUQuest). In every vertical, maximally five results are
                    shown on the front page. To see more results (in an overlay screen), the user
                    has to click "More".</div>

                            search engines became more efficient and users more often found what
                            they needed with one query. The proportion of single-query sessions in

                            data, because RemBench sessions contain more queries on average – hence
                            a smaller portion of queries are the start of a new topic. An important
                            difference with web search data is that generalization, specialization
                            and reformulation are similarly frequent in the RemBench data, whereas
                            the generalization and specialization are much more infrequent in web
                            search data. This indicates that it was relatively difficult for the
                            users to find the precise results they were looking for (not too
                            specific, not too general). In addition, for some topics, the
                            reformulations are shifts from Dutch to English or from English to
                            Dutch, e.g. the query "Rembrandt stadhuis" followed by the query
                                "Rembrandt city hall". </div>

                            the final version of RemBench. The inconsistency between results for
                            English and Dutch queries (comment 2) confirms our observation in
                            Section 5.2.d that query reformulations are sometimes translations from
                            English from Dutch or from Dutch to English. The inconsistencies in
                            results between the two languages are not easy to solve: The databases
                            contain textual information in both English and Dutch, but not all
                            information is available in both languages. For example, RemDoc contains
                            transcriptions of 17<span class="hi superscript">th</span>-century Dutch
                            documents together with translations of the documents in modern English,
                            while the modern Dutch translation is not included. Although this is a
                            relevant problem for multi-lingual databases, solving it is beyond the
                            scope of this research, because it requires expansion of the content of
                            the (external) databases. The same holds for comment 3, about finding
                            works of art with specific topics, because indexing depends on the
                            metadata that is available for works of art in RKDartists (see also the
                            work by Yee et al. [<a class="ref" href="#yee2003">Yee, Swearingen, Li, and Hearst 2003</a>], discussed in Section 2.2).
                            The selection of metadata values for topics in works of art leads to a
                            bias towards the retrieval of relevant works: only the topics that exist
                            as labels in the metadata, and only the works that have been labelled
                            with these topics can in theory be found with a text-based retrieval
                            engine. For example, a painting with a dog that has not been labelled
                            with the topic "dog", cannot be found by a text-based retrieval
                            engine for the query "dog".</div>

                                [<a class="ref" href="#trant2009">Trant 2009</a>]. The value of topic annotations for image

                            satisfaction. Thus they recommend: "For optimal access, representations for images
                                    should provide access to the topic of the image and objects
                                    within the image, namely, what is portrayed in the image as well
                                    as what the image is about"

                            problems finding the exact answer because they got too many irrelevant
                            results. This resulted in more time needed for finding the answer. The
                            large amount of results was in many cases caused by the presence of the
                            word "Rembrandt" in the query (e.g. the query "Rembrandt dogs"
                            for the question "Did Rembrandt paint dogs?"). For a query with
                            both terms, the search system returns all documents that contain both
                            terms <span class="hi italic">or</span> one of the two terms. The Boolean
                            operator AND could be helpful here (which is allowed in the Solr query

                            returned results contain both terms. In the final version of RemBench,
                            discounting of the term weight for the query term "Rembrandt" was
                            implemented, in order to ensure that for queries with the word
                                "Rembrandt" and some other word(s), results that contain only
                            the other words (e.g. "dog") are ranked higher than results that

                        Rembrandt researchers, the interactions of the subjects with RemBench and
                        the user satisfaction were analysed (See Section 5), leading to the
                        following conclusions:</div>
                    <div class="ptext"><ol class="list"><li class="item">RemBench users enter more queries per session than web search users;
                            the distribution of queries per session is more similar to sessions in
                            digital library search. This reflects the informational nature of the
                            questions in a specific topic domain, as opposed to the high proportion
                            of navigational queries on the web. Still, the average number of queries
                            needed per question is relatively low (2.0), which indicates that the
                            RemBench search interface allows for efficient information
                            seeking.</li><li class="item">The combination of different source types is highly important in the
                            art history domain. Four databases were combined as four different
                            verticals in the search interface. This was preferred by domain experts,
                            and also highly valued by the participants of the user study. Especially
                            the combination of works of art, primary and secondary sources was
                            considered an important asset of RemBench.</li><li class="item">Both free-text search and facet filtering were actively used by the
                            observed participants. There were individual differences in the
                            frequency of use of queries and facets: Some users preferred free-text
                            searching, while others had a preference for filtering facets. This
                            finding confirms the value of faceted search interfaces for
                            domain-specific information-seeking tasks. </li><li class="item">The users appreciated the presence of multi-lingual data (Dutch and
                            English) in the connected databases. However, they were critical about
                            the cross-lingual access to the data. In many cases, they had to try
                            their queries in both English and Dutch in order to get the results that
                            they wanted. This illustrates the challenge of managing databases with
                            multilingual content and shows the importance of cross-lingual
                            information access to multilingual data. </li><li class="item">A search environment for a highly specific domain (such as Rembrandt)
                            requires domain-dependent treatment of the data and in some cases also
                            of the queries. Domain-specificity requires pre-selection of relevant
                            data from the connected databases (see Section 3). In addition, term
                            discounting for the specific query term "Rembrandt" had to be
                            implemented, because it was difficult for the participants to get the
                            exact results they wanted for queries containing this high frequent term
                            (see Section 5.3.c). More analysis in future work is required in order
                            to answer the question that arises from the analysis: under what
                            circumstances does a highly specific topic domain require
                            domain-specific re-weighting of query terms, and when are the ordinary
                            term weighting variables (term frequency, inverted document frequency)

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">Previous research has shown that for most usability tests, the proportion of
                        additional usability problems found when adding test users quickly decreases
                        after five users. This was confirmed by the user study: Nine participants
                        were enough to discover all usability issues. The thinking-aloud protocol
                        was successful. When a researcher makes extensive notes, no microphone
                        recordings are necessary. In addition, screen capture was more useful than
                        camera recordings, which provided very little additional information about
                        the behaviour of the user. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">There is a strong correlation between answer satisfaction and usability
                        satisfaction, and the agreement between two users trying to find the answer
                        to the same question is low. This confirms that information seeking tasks
                        cannot be evaluated independently of usability. This is not necessarily
                        problematic, but should be taken into account in the design of future
                        usability studies for information seeking: The more difficult the task, the
                        lower the users’ judgements of the usability. List questions receive the
                        lowest satisfaction scores (significantly lower than closed questions), and
                        require the most interactions (significantly more than factoid questions). </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">Three limitations of the presented user study should be acknowledged: First,
                        the introduction of an externally imposed information need (a question
                        formulated by someone else) is an efficient way of studying
                        information-seeking behaviour. It implies, however, that the participants
                        were not the "owners" of the questions. As a result, no strong
                        conclusions can be drawn about user effort (number of queries issued, number
                        of results inspected), because the amount of effort that a user puts into a
                        search task depends on the urgency and importance of his research question –
                        aspects that are unknown for non-owners. In addition, research by
                        Chouldechova and Mease [<a class="ref" href="#chouldechova2013">Chouldechova and Mease 2013</a>] has shown that
                        topic owners are better capable of judging the relevance of retrieved
                        results than non-owners. Especially for the questions that required an
                        (exhaustive) search for elements of a list (e.g. "list all...", "how
                            many...") it was difficult for a user who is not the owner of the
                        information need to judge the completeness of the answer. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p64">64</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p64">The second limitation is that the retrieval effectiveness as perceived by the
                        user is limited by the content of the underlying databases. Information that
                        is not contained in the database, such as topical metadata labels for
                        images, cannot be retrieved by the user. In addition to that, users tend to
                        trust the information retrieved and the ranking by the search engine [<a class="ref" href="#pan2007">Pan, Hembrooke, Joachims, Lorigo, Gay, and Granka 2007</a>]: they click on the highest-ranked results. If users
                        have high trust with the search engine, while relevant information is
                        missing from the underlying databases or the relevant information is ranked
                        too low by the search engine, the results found by the users for their

                        future research, this user characteristic should be taken into account: when
                        does a user decide to stop searching, either because he (thinks he) has
                        found the information he needed, or because he gives up on finding the
                        information [<a class="ref" href="#baskaya2013">Baskaya, Keskustalo, and Järvelin 2013</a>]? </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">The third limitation of the study is that all participants were students. One
                        risk of this is that the information-seeking behaviour of students differs
                        from the behaviour of (older) researchers [<a class="ref" href="#weiler2005">Weiler 2005</a>].
                        According to Rowlands et al. [<a class="ref" href="#rowlands2008">Rowlands, Nicholas, Williams, Huntington, Fieldhouse, Gunter, ... and Tenopir 2008</a>], the generation
                        who grew up with Google-style search relies "heavily on search engines, view rather than read
                                and do not possess the critical and analytical skills to assess the
                                information that they find on the web"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#rowlands2008">Rowlands, Nicholas, Williams, Huntington, Fieldhouse, Gunter, ... and Tenopir 2008</a>, 290]. On the other hand, the authors state that the impact of ICT on this
                        generation should not be overestimated, and that "we are
                            all the Google generation, the young and old, the professor and the
                            student and the teacher and the child." In addition, university
                        students may act more as researchers than as ad hoc searchers when they are
                        put in a working context such as the RemBench user study. Future research
                        should address the differences between students and researchers in their
                        information-seeking behaviour.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66">A user observation study with RemBench, a domain-specific federated search engine
                    in the art history domain, provided several important insights. First, the study
                    confirmed the importance of different source types (primary and secondary
                    sources, textual and graphical sources) for the art history domain, which is not
                    an atypical domain in the humanities; e.g. archaeology, media studies,
                    historical literary and linguistic studies often work with combinations of
                    textual and graphical sources. We showed that different source types from
                    multiple databases can successfully be combined in a <em class="term">federated
                        search</em> engine. Second, we found that although there are large
                    individual differences in the preferred information seeking style, <em class="term">faceted
                        search</em> is a highly valued functionality. In addition, the study
                    presented in this paper showed that the usability of domain-specific search
                    engines can be evaluated successfully using a thinking-aloud protocol with a
                    small number of participants, but that the measures usability satisfaction
                    depends on the difficulty of the task given to the user.</div>
