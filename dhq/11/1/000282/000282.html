                <p> This article discusses the culture of digital citation within the humanities,
                    with specific reference to research done on the citation of two well-used
                    digital resources: British History Online and the Early English Books Online
                    Text Creation Partnership. Because these two resources are available in both
                    print and digital form, they provide a good test case of whether academics
                    prefer to cite print sources when they have used digital resources in their
                    research.</p>

                "The initial effect of printing was not that of an increased
                        distribution of identical copies being put into numerous hands...it was,
                        first and foremost, the very transformation of the ethics of reading and

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">There is no doubt that print sources, as opposed to digital ones, still carry
                    immense cultural cachet. As this article will explore in detail, many scholars
                    prefer to cite the print version of a work, even when they have only seen a
                    digital surrogate, in part because of this perceived prestige. We shall see that
                    such practice is problematic in a number of ways, and causes difficulties even
                    when using resources which are widely used and respected. For example, reference
                    works such as the <cite class="title italic">Oxford English Dictionary</cite> (OED)
                    and <cite class="title italic">Encyclopedia Britannica</cite> (particularly the 11th
                    edition of 1910-11) are viewed as paragons of scholarship. Those who have worked
                    in reference publishing (such as the authors of this paper) may have a slightly
                    more nuanced view: mistakes and misjudgements inevitably occur and a large pool
                    of contributors creates problems of consistency. The larger the project (the OED
                    runs to 20 volumes plus supplements as of last printing<a class="noteRef" href="#d7647e225">[2]</a>) the more difficult amendments, at least in the print copies,
                    become.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">An example of this unevenness is the OED entry for <em class="term">hubris</em>, which
                    falls far below its usual standards. The definition is "Presumption, orig. towards the gods; pride, excessive
                        self-confidence"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#oed1933">OED 1933</a>]. This is flatly contradicted by the first quotations,
                    which have nothing to do with gods. The etymology is short by OED standards,
                        "&lt;Greek <span class="foreign i">ὓβρις</span>" and
                    inadequate: which parts of the definition equate to Greek <span class="foreign i">ὓβρις</span>? All of them? Arguably none of them do, in
                    fact. Liddell and Scott’s Greek Lexicon, still the standard dictionary of
                    classical Greek for English speakers, gives a number of meanings of <span class="foreign i">ὓβρις</span>: "wanton violence;
                        insolence; lust, lewdness; (of animals) violence; an outrage; violation,
                        rape; serious injury to the person; a loss by sea; an overbearing
                        man". The sense development from Greek to English has been ignored by
                    the OED, except insofar as it has confused the definer.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">A much better treatment of <em class="term">hubris</em> is to be found in Wikipedia [<a class="ref" href="#wikipedia2016">Wikipedia 2016</a>]. Here the complexities of the term are addressed
                    much more fully<a class="noteRef" href="#d7647e265">[3]</a>. The
                    OED entry was written in 1933 and, it seems, has not been revised since, other
                    than to add some newer citations. There is no doubt that when the OED team comes
                    around to revising <cite class="title">hubris</cite> they will produce a superior
                        entry<a class="noteRef" href="#d7647e271">[4]</a>. However, it is likely that there will never be another print
                    edition of the OED [<a class="ref" href="#dailytelegraph2014">Daily Telegraph 2014</a>], so any improved
                        <em class="term">hubris</em> will never be citable in a print format. Advocates of
                    print citation over digital citation would be condemned by their stated
                    principles to forever cite a piece of work that is flawed.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">It is clear that we are at a critical juncture in the culture of citation.
                    Reference sources and journals are increasingly becoming online only, or exist
                    online in expanded versions of print. Yet, for reasons this paper will explore,
                    there is still a widespread aversion to the citing (as opposed to the using) of
                    digital resources. It remains a brave researcher who will cite Wikipedia in
                    preference to the OED.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In this article we will explore the resistance to citing digital sources that is
                    still widespread in the humanities. We have found that this resistance is
                    particularly prevalent where a print version of the source also exists; for this
                    reason we have focused on two digital projects which can be consulted online but
                    whose citations can be silently "converted" to a print-only
                    reference. As well as presenting the results of several surveys of users, we
                    will suggest some solutions to the culture of non-citation which we
                    uncovered.</div>

                <h1 class="head">A neglected topic</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Despite our discovery of this pervasive culture of non-citation, we have been
                    able to find little mention of it as a research topic. It is noticeable, in
                    reviewing the literature on digital citation, that cross-disciplinary studies of
                    the subject tend to <em class="emph">exclude</em> humanities subjects<a class="noteRef" href="#d7647e316">[5]</a>, preferring to measure disciplines
                    from the sciences and social sciences. One such study says, "Humanities papers were excluded from the analysis
                            because of their long citation windows and high uncitedness
                            rates"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#lozano">Lozano et al. n.d.</a>]. Effectively, digital citations in the humanities are so low as not to
                    register in comparison with science and social sciences: "The very low percentage of articles cited at least once
                            may be a reflection of the tendency of humanities researchers to cite
                            books instead of articles"

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Note that here we are talking about citation of articles. The focus of this
                    article, the citation of digital resources, appears to be the unloved son of the
                    unloved son. This impression is borne out by the present authors’ experience
                    when surveying journal editors about their digital citation practices. Many
                    editors assumed, in an understandable but illuminating example of
                        <em class="emph">déformation professionelle</em>, that by digital citation we meant
                    simply citation of online articles. This is not primarily what we mean here, but
                    it is important to note that citation of articles is more familiar to humanities
                    scholars than citation of digital resources such as digital libraries. This is
                    in part because tools such as Crossref automatically offer digital citations for
                    articles alongside print citations and in part because citation of online
                    articles has a certain congruity and familiarity with their print siblings.</div>

                    citation in the written output: "references clearly did not represent the extent of

                    likelihood of citing e-texts where no corresponding print version exists [<a class="ref" href="#sukovic2009">Sukovic 2009</a>, 1009]. What is unique about the present study
                    is that we have concentrated on digital resources where a print copy does exist
                    and where a digital citation is very easily converted to a print citation. This
                    situation provides the sternest test of a scholar’s attitude and citation
                    ethics, which in itself reflects the prevailing attitude to the scholarliness of
                    each type of citation.</div>

                    Historical Research (IHR) and the History of Parliament Trust (HoP). It contains
                    about 1250 transcribed texts to date. EEBO-TCP is a collaboration between the
                    Universities of Oxford and Michigan and the commercial publisher ProQuest, which
                    creates searchable XML-encoded editions of early English books based on
                    ProQuest’s image resource. EEBO-TCP began in 1999 and will ultimately create
                    around 70,000 full texts which are accessed chiefly via ProQuest’s interface,
                    although there are also other, local implementations. EEBO-TCP is currently
                    available only through academic subscription at institutional level. However,

                    edition of a particular work, then the first edition is selected unless there is

                    impact on scholarship in relevant fields. The analysis surveyed EEBO and
                    EEBO-TCP-related publications in databases such as JSTOR and Scopus,
                    demonstrating a steady growth in such publications over the decade 2002 to 2012.
                    The Scopus data allows us to see the country of the authors of the publications,
                    indicating that authors from USA and the UK are most likely to mention their use
                    of EEBO, followed by two other English-speaking countries, Canada and Australia.
                    If we look at the journals that these articles were published in, we find a
                    range of journals chiefly in the fields of English Literature, Language and
                    History of the medieval and early modern periods. The bibliographic data,
                    therefore, supports the assertion that EEBO has had an increasing positive
                    impact on scholarship, particularly in English-speaking countries [<a class="ref" href="#siefring2013">Siefring and Meyer 2013</a>, 29–31]. </div>

                    below), as with BHO, indicated that many scholars, particularly in the
                    humanities, fail to cite or otherwise acknowledge their use of digital
                    resources. The quantitative data accumulated during bibliometric analysis can
                    therefore only be partial; if users are not citing their use of EEBO and
                    EEBO-TCP then any numbers-based demonstration of their impact could be
                    significantly lower than the true impact on scholarship. This disparity raises
                    the issue of citation practice – what are users citing if they are not pointing
                    to their use of digital collections? The image sets in EEBO and the full texts
                    based on them in EEBO-TCP are based on actual printed books from libraries
                    around the world: do users cite these original print copies even though they
                    have never actually seen them? </div>

                    BHO, with a different URL. These have been given a suffixed letter to
                    disambiguate what would otherwise be the same URL:</div>

                    URLs, they are not necessarily best practice. Better still would be a meaningful
                    string chosen by an editor: in the Lords and Commons journals this would be the
                    date of sitting; in the VCH example above, the parish or other unit under
                    discussion. This could not be done retrospectively in this case, but can be done
                    conveniently as content is created. Future material digitised on the site will
                    use an editorial decision to create each URL. For example, since relaunch the
                    site has published Proceedings in Parliament 1624, each with a bespoke URL
                    encoding the date of sitting:</div>

                    early to say if this change of URL convention will make a difference to the
                    under-citation of BHO discussed above. But one of the impediments given to
                    digital citation has, for this resource, been definitively removed. Indeed a
                    further refinement was added in October 2015, in response to the objection that
                    a page range was too imprecise for an academic reference. When the user mouses
                    over a paragraph of text, a pilcrow appears in the left-hand margin (very
                    faintly, so as not to be distracting); clicking on the pilcrow inserts the
                    relevant paragraph number into the URL bar, allowing a more precise reference
                    than a traditional print one.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p57">57</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p57">These practical measures could help users feel more comfortable with the
                    practicalities of digital citation. However, the more philosophical discomfort
                    of according digital materials the same weight as print must also be addressed.
                    Those working in the field of digital content creation are doubtless aware that
                    some digital resources seem to be held in particularly high esteem. Despite the
                    nuances of editorial practice discussed at the beginning of this article, the
                    OED or the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, for example, are understood
                    to be built on sound scholarship and their medium is considered unimportant.
                    With such examples in mind, other digital content creators could usefully
                    consider how best to promote the scholarly rigour and importance of their own
                    resource as a way of gradually eroding residual beliefs in the lack of
                    respectability of the digital. As a first step, web resources should provide
                    easily accessible editorial documentation at the point of accessing texts and
                    images (rather than solely on project-descriptive websites), enabling users to
                    fully understand the nature of the material they are accessing and the
                    assumptions that they can make about it. By making clear the nature of their
                    materials, content creators encourage researchers to use them in appropriate
                    ways and thereby enhance their own scholarly reputations.</div>

                    inclusion in local documentation given to students as they begin their studies.
                    Although beyond the scope of this article, a survey of what guidelines are
                    currently used would provide useful data on the current generation of students

                    training sessions could be worthwhile, providing that they are properly promoted
                    to encourage good attendance. By integrating awareness of the nature of digital
                    resources and the importance of citing them directly into teaching, digital

                    journal articles will be that journal publishers themselves are steadily moving
                    towards online-only publication for their journals (for obvious economic
                    reasons). Alice Meadows, of Wiley Publishing, argues in a blog post that one
                    sticking point — the provision of print journals to members as a key benefit of
                    the membership of a learned society — is beginning to become less important as
                    an issue [<a class="ref" href="#meadows2012">Meadows 2012</a>]. Another driver will be the moves towards
                    open access in journal publishing: open access presupposes a digital format.
                    Likewise the changes to the UK Research Excellence Framework (in operation after
                    1 April 2016) will require scholars to deposit all scholarly outputs in an
                    institutional repository (by their nature, primarily digital) [<a class="ref" href="#hefce2015">HEFCE 2015</a>].</div>

                    thinking as journal editors, so they thought only of journal citation. But it
                    seems plausible too that the ubiquity of DOIs has acted as a forcing function:
                    editors have had to engage with them and make policy decisions about them. There
                    has been no such forcing function for other digital sources, as is evidenced by
                    survey responses such as: "I would change them [digital citations] to
                        print, but have actually not had the need to, since authors seem to choose

                    print items, and items which are born-digital – researchers cite some online

                    moves will change the focus within digital scholarship. It might help, too, to
                    bear in mind historical precedents. For example, we might consider when it
                    became standard practice to include colophon data or title page printing
                    information during the move from manuscript to print culture. We should also
                    bear in mind that there is an element of serendipity in which citation methods
                    take off and which don’t. For example, in classical studies, Stephanus
                    pagination has become a standard way of referencing the work of Plato. The
                    system is based on a 1578 edition of Plato’s works by Henri Estienne [<a class="ref" href="#wikipedia2016">Wikipedia 2016</a>]. Estienne is also responsible for the division of
                    Bible chapters into verses that have become so conventional today that many do
                    not realise that verses, and indeed chapters, of the Bible are bibliographic
                    conventions that have nothing to do with the earliest known manuscripts. It was
                    pure chance that these arbitrary systems, eschewing page numbers and even
                    editions, became the standard. It is easy to imagine other, equally arbitrary
                    but effective, citation norms arising for the citation of digital texts.</div>

                    should lessen, and citation should improve. Open access and changes to the REF
                    in the UK will, as mentioned above, sharpen the imperative to cite digital
                    versions of content. Like the OED, many journals are abandoning print. Young
