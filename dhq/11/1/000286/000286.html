                <p>James Patterson is the world’s best-selling living author, but his approach to
                    writing is heavily criticised for being too commercially driven — in many
                    respects, he is considered the master of the airport novel, a highly-productive
                    source of commuter fiction. A former marketing professional, Patterson uses his
                    business acumen to drive sales of his novels, which are largely written in
                    conjunction with lesser-known co-authors. Using stylometry, this paper analyses
                    the extent to which Patterson actually contributes to the writing of his
                    novels, situating his process within the context of literary capitalism and the
                    novel as a force of modernity. </p>

                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">James Patterson is among the world’s best-selling living authors, but his
                    approach to literature is often derided. Patrick Anderson of <cite class="title italic">The Washington Post</cite> labels his work as "sick, sexist, sadistic and subliterate", while Stephen
                    King describes Patterson, quite frankly, as "a terrible writer"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. Patterson’s background is in marketing, and indeed he makes unapologetic
                    use of advertising techniques to increase sales. His writing style is largely
                    considered to be simplistic; his subject matter excessively emotive. Moreover,
                    he hires collaborators, who, according to our analysis, complete much of the
                    actual writing. However, as we will describe in this paper, it is in such a
                    context that we can situate Patterson as working within structures of literary
                    production indissociable from the capitalist forces which drive most literary
                    production. His re-discovery and refinement of the novel’s popular traditions is
                    accompanied by a choice of style and subject matter that make his works
                    exemplary of the experience of leisure-time in late capitalism. Patterson’s
                    particular achievement is to be both author and producer; creator, brand, and
                    corporation. Patterson is, in many respects, as much a trademark as he is a
                    writer. His name is a stamp of approval. What does this mean for our
                    constructions of "the author"? Does Patterson’s name on the cover mean that
                    a particular novel is written <em class="emph">by</em> Patterson, or that it has been
                        <em class="emph">approved</em> by Patterson? Is his name an indicator of the style of
                    a novel, or a gesture towards its structure and content? In our stylometric
                    analyses, we examine the extent to which Patterson actively collaborates on the
                    writing of his novels, exploring his approach in the context of the wider
                    culture industry and its capitalist modes of literary production. Patterson
                    appropriates and manipulates the economic, social, and industrial forces which
                    have shaped the form and content of the novel since its ascent in the
                    eighteenth-century. Informing our discussion with computer-assisted analyses,
                    the focus of which is Patterson, we problematise the relationship between the
                    novel and style.</div>

                <h1 class="head">Defining the Novel</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">There is disagreement on the precise origins of the novel, with some suggesting
                    its roots be traced back some two thousand years [<a class="ref" href="#doody1997">Doody 1997</a>].
                    Typically, however, scholars accept Ian Watt’s assertion that the novel is an
                    eighteenth-century literary form, emerging as a response to romantic prose. It
                    is worth noting that while much of the literature we reference focuses on the
                    evolution of the British novel, wherein other scholars discuss the form as a
                    more global genre, we see little distinction, in the context of this study,
                    between the novels of American writers like Patterson and those of French
                    authors such as Dumas. Watt connects the rise of the novel to the forces of
                    modernity, particularly the emergence of the "commercial and industrial classes"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#watt2001">Watt 2001</a>, 61], as well as an increase in secular thinking and individualism. John
                    Richetti agrees, commenting in <cite class="title italic">The English Novel in
                        History</cite>, that early fiction marks "an important stage in the fashioning and a key tool for
                            the understanding of this evolving entity, the socially constructed
                            self"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#richetti1999">Richetti 1999</a>, 4]. Richetti further notes that the "expectations for narrative that came to dominate the
                            minds of readers in those years, as well as the popularity of such
                            narratives, may be related to larger intellectual and social
                            changes"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#richetti2002">Richetti 2002</a>, 2]. J. Paul Hunter presents early readers of the novel as being young, a
                    product of most novels being "about young people on the verge of making important
                            life decisions about love or career or both"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2002">Hunter 2002</a>, 20]. Crucial to this study, Hunter outlines how "novelists repeatedly set themselves the task of
                            addressing situations in which large numbers of readers had a vital
                            interest"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2002">Hunter 2002</a>, 20]. A dominant caricature was present at the time, Samuel Johnson describing
                    readers of the form as young, ignorant, idle time wasters [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2002">Hunter 2002</a>, 20–21], "not traditionally educated"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2002">Hunter 2002</a>, 20], a contention that Hunter refutes: "The time to read had to be stolen from somewhere when
                            life was lived under such difficult and precarious conditions"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2002">Hunter 2002</a>, 21]. This tendency reverberates in the popular contemporary novel, where the
                    primary objective for authors is often the provision of entertainment. Hunter
                    attributes the eighteenth-century rise of the novel to readers’ need for "pleasure": <blockquote><p>… the joy of escape from
                        drudgery or routine; the pleasure of a story well told and a plot carefully
                        built; satisfaction in seeing outcomes (and even solutions) in the
                        recognizable situations of daily life; identification with characters who
                        faced (and often mastered) difficult situations; and, perhaps, the
                        recognition of a part of oneself in a fictional other who might take a
                        different course or come to a different end — as well as the more
                        traditional pleasures (carried over from romances) of compensatory fantasy
                        in contemplating people quite unlike oneself. [<a class="ref" href="#hunter2002">Hunter 2002</a>, 22]</p></blockquote></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">The power of this fantasy emanates from the "combination of
                        romance and formal realism", a feat which the novel accomplished "more insidiously than any previous fiction"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#watt2001">Watt 2001</a>, 205]. Further growth in commerce led to an increased market for print, but by
                    the same token, enhanced capacity for production: "Instead of a luxury affordable only by the privileged
                            and educated few, books and especially novels were part of the
                            revolution in the availability of consumer goods that changed the nature
                            of daily life for a large part of the population in Britain as the
                            eighteenth century progressed"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#richetti2002">Richetti 2002</a>, 6]. While access to the form has increased exponentially, its core traits
                    have remained intact: "the popular demand in fiction is always for a mixed
                            form, a romantic novel just romantic enough for the reader to project
                            his libido on the hero and his anima on the heroine, and just novel
                            enough to keep these projections in a familiar world"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#frye2006">Frye 2006</a>, 99]. As the novel became increasingly saturated by theory, and influenced by
                    social movements, each generation saw varying transformations to the form. As
                    Marthe Robert aptly notes, "its boundaries fluctuate in all directions"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#robert2000">Robert 2000</a>, 58]. What has remained a constant throughout is the continued democratisation
                    of reading, a movement which has often been connected to a perceived
                    deterioration in literary quality. This is where one of the primary concerns of
                    our examination takes hold, upon the tension between plot and style, and whether
                    or not, in such a context, style tells us little more than who completed the
                    actual writing, as opposed to who devised the narrative framework into which
                    such words are poured. It is difficult to argue which activity is more essential
                    without falling into the largely unhelpful binary of "substance over
                    style". Saying this, and adages aside, the novel has always been about plot,
                    about reader-driven content designed to obscure social realities under romantic
                    elements and sensational details. Privileging style is the exception, not the
                    rule, and is limited to specific literary epochs, such as high modernism.
                    Patterson, as we will see, takes the contrary position to the stylists — not
                    only do his novels privilege fast-paced plot over character and situational
                    development, but his writing method seems to have been reduced down to providing
                    an overview of the plot which someone else, to whatever little extent, then
                    fleshes out. The relationship between plot and style has undergone increased
                    strain as a product of contemporary writing practices, more susceptible to
                    capitalist modes of production than ever before.</div>

                    the world’s most successful living author, outselling J. K. Rowling, Dan Brown,
                    and John Grisham combined [<a class="ref" href="#wood2009">Wood 2009</a>]. Between 2006 and 2010, one
                    in every seventeen novels sold in the United States was authored by Patterson
                        [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. He has achieved this feat by publishing copious
                    numbers of reasonably successful novels rather than a select few blockbusters.
                    His most successful release, 1993’s <cite class="title italic">Along Came A
                        Spider</cite>, only reached number two on the bestseller charts. Its five
                    million print-run is small compared to that of say, Dan Brown’s <cite class="title italic">The Da Vinci Code</cite>; however, by 2014 he had published
                    in excess of 100 novels. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Patterson wrote his first thriller in 1976, but before the 1990s his main
                    employment and source of income lay in marketing. He worked at J. Walter
                    Thompson, where he became its youngest ever creative director and eventually
                    chief executive of North American operations [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. His
                    marketing continues to inform his approach to promotion and writing. In fact,
                    the two processes, Patterson’s writing and his marketing, are somewhat
                    indistinguishable. For <cite class="title italic">Along Came A Spider</cite>, he took
                    the unusual step of using television advertising [<a class="ref" href="#wroe2013">Wroe 2013</a>],
                    paying for it out of his own pocket [<a class="ref" href="#deighton2006">Deighton 2006</a>, 8]. Since
                    then, he has taken control of his own marketing from his publisher, Little,
                    Brown and Co., a division of Hachette [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. Two editors
                    and three full-time Hachette employees, plus assistants, work exclusively for
                    Patterson. According to Michael Pietsch, his editor and publisher, "Jim is at the very least co-publisher of his own
                            books"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#deighton2006">Deighton 2006</a>, 5]. Patterson, in this sense, is bigger than his publisher. In outranking
                    his publisher, he differs significantly from many forms of commercial fiction.
                    Mills and Boon, for instance, employ writers to create romance novels that
                    conform to a limited horizon of reader expectation. Watt describes how in the
                    eighteenth-century, the bookseller-publishers of Grub street used to employ
                    writers, often paying by the word, to churn out novels and translate works from
                    French [<a class="ref" href="#watt2001">Watt 2001</a>, 55]. Commercial fiction has always been
                    driven by the demands of its readership. What makes Patterson different, is that
                    he exerts personal control over the publishing apparatus which seek to match
                    literary content to the market. Patterson brings a new level of rigour to
                    marketing within the publishing industry. This is acknowledged by Larry
                    Kirschbaum, former head of Little, Brown: "Until the last 15 years or so, the thought that you
                            could mass-merchandise authors had always been resisted… Jim was at the
                            forefront of changing that"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">What Patterson shares with the writers of Mills and Boon novels, the forgotten
                    eighteenth-century hack pieces, and the dime novels and penny dreadfuls of the
                    nineteenth-century, is that he writes simple, populistic works with no
                    pretensions of academic literary quality, designed to sell. But, like the
                    publishers of Grub Street, he has a greater number and variety of books to sell
                    than most authors can produce. As we will discuss, he achieves this in part by
                    hiring collaborators. Patterson therefore has properties of the traditional
                    popular author, properties of the publishing house, as well as those of the
                    modern marketing executive. If the development of the form and content of
                    popular fiction is explainable to a large extent by the socio-economic factors
                    that drive its production,<a class="noteRef" href="#d9856e402">[1]</a> then
                    Patterson is in the unusual position of possessing an overview of these factors,
                    and writing and commissioning fiction accordingly. As such, economic forces do
                    not simply shape his work externally or deterministically, but are put to play
                    by him from the outset to determine a written product that will be popular,
                    marketable, and replicable. It is said of Dumas, père, to whom we will return,
                    that he "did not exist at all, he was only a myth, a trademark
                            invented by a syndicate of editors to dupe the public"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#lucasdubreton">Lucas-Dubreton n.d.</a>]. As already noted, Patterson is himself a trademark, a stamp of approval
                    that is more indicative of a novel’s structure than it is its style.</div>

                    into the demographics of his audience [<a class="ref" href="#deighton2006">Deighton 2006</a>, 5].
                    Such research has even directly influenced the content of his work — in one
                    case, in order to make up for a lag of sales on the West coast of the United
                    States, where John Grisham was the dominant author, he decided to locate his
                    second thriller series, <cite class="title italic">The Women’s Murder Club</cite>, in
                    San Francisco [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. In a generally complimentary
                    assessment, Jonathan Mahler says of Patterson’s TV campaign for his breakthrough
                    work, <cite class="title italic">Along Came A Spider</cite>: "It’s entirely possible, even quite likely, that without
                            those ads, <cite class="title italic">Along Came a Spider</cite> never would
                            have made the bestseller list, and that James Patterson would now be
                            just another thriller writer"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. The problem with such an appraisal is not that it ascribes Patterson’s success to his marketing alone, but that it considers Patterson’s
                    literary work and the surrounding marketing as separate in the first place.
                    Rather, the literary and commercial facets of his work reinforce each other to
                    the point where, as in the case of his choice of location for <cite class="title italic">The Women’s Murder Club</cite> series, they are
                    indistinct.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">When producing a novel, Patterson uses about a dozen readers as a soundboard for
                    the work in progress, making alterations as they point to the "weaker" elements of a story [<a class="ref" href="#deighton2006">Deighton 2006</a>, 5]. His writing is designed to arrest readers’ attention, and to
                    encourage them to buy into a series of novels, typically based around a primary,
                    re-occurring character or characters. As Nicholas Wroe explains: "His prose is doggedly functional with short sentences
                            and chapters relentlessly working to propel the plot"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#wroe2013">Wroe 2013</a>]. His use of short chapters, says Mahler, "creates a lot of half-blank pages; his books are, in a
                            very literal sense, page-turners"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. The development of this approach is premeditated. Patterson himself
                    describes how, after his earlier, less successful works, he is "less interested in sentences now and more interested in
                            stories"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. Of his first work, <cite class="title italic">The Thomas Berryman
                        Number</cite>, he says that he "couldn't have supported
                        [himself] on that kind of book", and that his writing is now "very self-consciously commercial"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#wood2009">Wood 2009</a>]. In developing a formula that has seen him become the world’s most
                    successful writer, Patterson’s new releases often do not receive press reviews,
                    but they attract a large number of reader reviews across online media. Here, it
                    is quickly apparent that his works are praised by readers for the qualities he
                    has intentionally fostered. An excerpt from an Amazon review for <cite class="title italic">I, Alex Cross</cite> reads: "This is well
                        written — using Patterson's usual quick and easy chapters," evidently
                    equating brevity with quality. Another review for the same work concludes:
                        "The thriller is written in short chapters, which I
                        like, and the font is large enough to make reading enjoyable. The prose is
                        clear, succinct, and paints a picture of full-blown evil and terror. A fast
                        read."<a class="noteRef" href="#d9856e505">[2]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">That Patterson should let the reader instruct the form and content of his work is
                    not a perversion of the proper order of literary creation. Rather, it seems to
                    be constitutive of the rise to prominence of the novel in the modern era. For
                    Watt, the relative democratisation of readership in the eighteenth-century
                    encouraged writers to write "very explicitly and even
                        tautologically" for the audience, while also, as we will see with
                    Patterson, writing quickly in order to increase business throughput [<a class="ref" href="#watt2001">Watt 2001</a>, 56]. Thus, a simplification of writing form was a
                    defining characteristic of the development of the modern, popular novel.
                    Patterson also seems to be drawing from contemporary cinema and television. The
                    cinematic narrative is constructed in the editor’s lab out of a patchwork of
                    sounds and images; for Walter Benjamin, the screen actor’s performance, and her
                    experience of it, "is assembled from many individual performances"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2002c">Benjamin 2002c</a>, 112]. This mosaic-like structure is echoed in Patterson’s short paragraphs and
                    chapters which lurch the protagonist from crisis to crisis. As such, he has
                    further simplified the reading process by bringing its narrative presentation
                    into line with a reader whose attention is shaped by film and television, and
                    the truncated and informal writing style of the Internet.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">In a short early article on a genre of German nineteenth-century literature,
                    Benjamin asks: "Chambermaid’s romances? Since when are works of art
                            categorized according to the class which consumes them? Unfortunately,
                            they are not, or all too seldom"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2005">Benjamin 2005</a>, 225]. Rather than being classified otherwise, such works have generally not
                    received any attention at all: "this entire body of literature has been despised for as
                            long as the superstitious belief in ‘absolute art’ has existed"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2005">Benjamin 2005</a>, 225]. For Watt, appraising perhaps the first modern instance of the novel’s
                    dominance in eighteenth-century England, this profession, which "in the eighteenth century probably constituted the
                            largest single occupational group"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#watt2001">Watt 2001</a>, 47], also shaped the content of the contemporaneous literature, most famously
                    in the eponymous heroine of <cite class="title italic">Pamela</cite>. Indeed, he goes
                    on to argue, the long dominant, and still prescient, themes of courtship, and
                    marrying above class, have their origin in the preponderance of women readers of
                    the novel, particularly from the lower, middle, and servant classes [<a class="ref" href="#watt2001">Watt 2001</a>, 148–149, 154, 163–164]. Patterson’s novels, also
                    with a predominantly female readership [<a class="ref" href="#deighton2006">Deighton 2006</a>, 5],
                    span many genres, but largely consist of a standard thriller formula, for
                    instance serial-killers and their opposing crime fighters, the latter juggling,
                    usually successfully, their work with their family commitments, weaving
                    contemporary problems of conflicting work-family demands with wider social fears
                    about terror and criminality — for an example, see <cite class="title italic">Along

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">The <em class="emph">form</em> of his novels also appears to be moulded by contemporary
                    experience. In particular, his work is perhaps best described as "commuter
                        fiction". Nicholas Paumgarten describes how the average time for a
                    commute has significantly increased [<a class="ref" href="#paumgarten2007">Paumgarten 2007</a>]. As a
                    result, reading has increasingly become one of those pursuits that can pass the
                    time of a commute. For example, a truck driver describes how "he had never read any of Patterson’s books but that he
                            had listened to every single one of them on the road"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mahler2010">Mahler 2010</a>]. A number of online reader reviews also describe Patterson’s writing in
                    terms of their commutes. One such reviewer of Patterson’s <cite class="title italic">The Postcard Killers </cite>directly relates the writing style to the
                    realities of modern transitional life: "As a consequence of
                        such short chapters I whizzed through this book in under two hours and it
                        was a fairly decent thriller and a good way to spend time commuting to
                        work."<a class="noteRef" href="#d9856e596">[3]</a> With large print, and
                    chapters of two or three pages, Patterson’s works are constructed to fit between
                    the stops on a metro line.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">We believe that, here, Patterson again exemplifies traits characteristic of the
                    rise of the novel. Disposable, leisurely art is, for Benjamin, the dominant
                    aesthetic form of late modernity: "Just as the art of the Greeks was geared toward
                            lasting, so the art of the present is geared toward being worn
                            out"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2002d">Benjamin 2002d</a>, 142]. To greatly summarise Benjamin’s position regarding the novel, this
                    disposability has its origins in the isolation of the subject, who no longer has
                    access to the continuity of communal experience. The novelist and reader are
                    exemplary for Benjamin of the crisis in experience that is symptomatic of late
                    modernity. The novelist, for their part, "... has secluded himself. The birthplace of the novel
                            is the individual in isolation ..."
                         [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2002b">Benjamin 2002b</a>, 146]. The reader of the novel is also "isolated, more so than any other reader … In this
                            solitude of his … he destroys, swallows up the material as a fire
                            devours a log in a fireplace"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2002d">Benjamin 2002d</a>, 156]. Benjamin suggests that this reflects a wholesale "change in the structure of their experience", as evidenced in the
                    experience of navigating a city, which he directly describes in terms of Marx’s
                    theory of alienation of the worker in industrial production [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2003a">Benjamin 2003a</a>, 314]. The pedestrian navigates through the
                    city "in a series of shocks and collisions",

                            they had to look at one another for long minutes or even hours without

                    prompted him to focus upon collaboration in order to dominate the market [<a class="ref" href="#wroe2013">Wroe 2013</a>]. As a result of this process, he produced 13 distinct
                    publications in 2012 and the same number in 2013. The co-authors are directly
                    employed by Patterson, assigned to a particular genre or series, and paid out of

                    provided a launching pad for their solo careers. While Patterson does not like
                    the term "boss", he concedes that he is the senior figure in any

                            specific about what each scene is supposed to accomplish. I get pages

                    has in fact aligned novel writing with the creative norm in contemporary
                    culture. As Hobsbawm says of the late twentieth-century: "Creation was now essentially cooperative rather than
                            individual, technological rather than manual"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#hobsbawm1994">Hobsbawm 1994</a>, 519]. A crucial juncture in the establishment of this modern paradigm, and of
                    its rise in the field of professional writing, was the introduction of the
                    producer system in early Hollywood cinema, wherein the producer takes precedence
                    over the director, overseeing a process in which labour is divided along lines
                    established in heavy industry, with the same goals of increased efficiency and
                    profit. The task of screenwriting is further sub-divided along these lines: "By the early teens, American studios not only had
                            writing departments but also sub-specialties within those
                            departments"

                    nineteenth-century French literature as the commercial returns for literature
                    increased. As such, the French novel, for Benjamin, appears to build upon the
                    commercial origin of the British novel, industrializing the already commercial
                    form. The most commercially successful writers of the era included Sue, Scribe,
                    and Dumas, each of which employed collaborators in order to increase output [<a class="ref" href="#benjamin2003c">Benjamin 2003c</a>, 14–15]. Benjamin cites Kreysig, who describes
                    the playwright Eugene Scribe in terms which mirror accounts of Patterson’s
                    method: <blockquote><p>...he transferred the principle of division of

                    increase profit, Patterson re-establishes techniques which dominated popular

                    this, Marx and Engels perceived that, by employing the principles of division of
                    labour which defined working existence, the collaborative approach generated
                    mass entertainment that was pleasurable, disposable, and efficient to create.
                    The culturally dominant forms of mass entertainment were thence increasingly
                    those which adopted the principle of division of labour: in cinema, and then
                    television, in the publisher-brand Mills and Boon novels in which the individual
                    authors were expendable and interchangeable, and then in Patterson, who has
                    become one of the world’s most commercially successful authors by using
                    hierarchical collaboration to launch multiple bestsellers each year. By drawing
                    on established cinematic archetypes of plot to write the kind of suspense which
                    people expect, and by employing a simple, punchy format, Patterson has devised a
                    commodity which is amenable to replication. As such, he displays the primary
                    motivation which has driven the production of the novel since the
                    eighteenth-century Grub Street booksellers began employing writers to fashion

                    and Andrew Gross for this investigation, largely as a consequence of access to
                    appropriate single-author samples. Patterson, by his own accounts, allocates
                    most of the actual writing to his junior partners. We formed the working
                    hypothesis that the collaborative novels would be stylometrically more similar
                    to texts written primarily by Patterson’s co-authors, rather than to any of the
                    novels attributed to Patterson alone. This study is based on the premise that
                    the lexical features we have selected are effective in distinguishing the
                    sentence writer over the architect of the plot. This correlates with much of the

                    [<a class="ref" href="#hoover2011">Hoover 2011</a>]. To provide a general intuitive description of this
                    method, Burrow’s Delta distances are measured between the collaborative text and
                    single-author texts for each participating author. However, distances are
                    measured to "windows" of the collaborative text, allowing for estimation as
                    to which sections carry the stylistic fingerprint of one contributor over
                    another. Sample single-author tests are then plotted over the baseline of the
                    collaborative text, where greater proximity to the baseline indicates greater
                    stylistic similarity, as defined by the Delta distance metric.</div>

                    to the abstract entity which is the plot of the works we have examined. We did
                    make an attempt at this, computationally measuring the frequency of action verbs
                    across a text.<a class="noteRef" href="#d9856e915">[4]</a> The expectation was, considering the genre, that there would be
                    significant spikes at particular points in the novel. Our hope was there would
                    be some noticeable trends, which did occur, across some of the Patterson only
                    novels, as opposed to the co-authored texts, which presented far more variation.
                    This would suggest that there is something significant in our results, yet, we
                    are not in a position to reasonably conclude that we are detecting an authorial
                    fingerprint, rather than just structures common to this particular genre. It
                    would be interesting, however, to return to this aspect of our analysis at a

                    another cluster consisting of Alex Cross novels and the Patterson novel, <cite class="title italic">The Lake House</cite>. One surprise result is that <cite class="title italic">First to Die</cite>, a solo Patterson text, is clustered with
                    the subsequent works in <cite class="title italic">The Women’s Murder Club

                    indicate that Gross was so influenced by the particular style that Patterson
                    manifested in this work that he imitated it more exactly than Patterson managed

                    have already discussed, is attributed solely to Patterson. <cite class="title italic">First to Die</cite>'s model is more interesting, as the work presents
                    itself as we would expect a true collaboration in which the authors have shared
                    the task of writing passages or sentences with Patterson intervening at critical
                    junctures. This seems to add plausibility to the conjecture that the work might
                    in fact have been written by Gross and Patterson, rather than Patterson alone,
                    as is officially stated. One might ultimately discount such a possibility, and
                    explain this anomaly as an artifact caused by the limitations of stylometric
                    analysis in its current stage of development. However, were we to accept these
                    results at face value, they might indicate an interesting situation in
                    commercial fiction: namely, a junior writer, Andrew Gross, having his name
                    erased from a book he co-wrote in order to increase the commercial value and
                    status of that book as a product. </div>

                <h1 class="head">Conclusions</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">The quantitative data suggests that Patterson’s collaborators perform the vast
                    majority of the actual writing. Our results demonstrate that Patterson, like
                    Dumas, has commodified his reputation as an author and met demand through
                    delegation. However, it appears that Patterson has generally been transparent
                    regarding his collaborative process, and has offered sufficient accreditation,
                    tutelage, opportunity, and financial reward to those with whom he works.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">The novel has always been a commercial form. Its rise was a product of the rise
                    of the bourgeoisie. But Patterson has perhaps brought the novel to its logical
                    conclusion. In a certain sense, Patterson’s works are not reducible to their
                    socio-economic context. Rather, wresting marketing control from his publisher,
                    hiring his own soundboard readers, and employing subsidiary writers, Patterson
                    generates pulp far more concentratedly than the vagaries of traditional
                    historical materialism would generally allow. While we might see "high
                        literature" as irreducible to its immediate socio-economic context
                    because the author is in a kind of dialogue with the whole literary and even
                    metaphysical canon, Patterson’s work is irreducible in the sense that he creates
                    his fiction in accordance with his own manipulations of its economic base.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">As Patterson says: "above all my brand stands for story. I became
                            successful when I stopped writing sentences and started writing stories.
                            Editors think it's about style. It's not. It's all story"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#deighton2006">Deighton 2006</a>, 5]. On the one hand, we note that for Patterson, this is just as well, as
                    our analysis shows that his stylometric fingerprint is sometimes weak, even in
                    his solo works. To keep things in perspective, we recall Aristotle's assertion
                    that plot (<a class="ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=su%2Fstasis&amp;la=greek&amp;can=su%2Fstasis0&amp;prior=pragma/twn" onclick="window.open('http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=su%2Fstasis&amp;la=greek&amp;can=su%2Fstasis0&amp;prior=pragma/twn'); return false"><span class="foreign i">μῦθος</span></a>) is the "arrangement of the incidents (<a class="ref" href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h(&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h(2&amp;prior=e)sti\n" onclick="window.open('http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=h(&amp;la=greek&amp;can=h(2&amp;prior=e)sti\n'); return false"><span class="foreign i">ἡ</span></a>

                         [<a class="ref" href="#aristotle1932">Aristotle 1932</a>]. Is plot, then, what makes an author? These findings demonstrate how
                    style is very much privileged across particular literary aesthetics, and that it
                    is, in many respects, relegated to an afterthought within contemporary popular
                    fiction. Style remains a powerful measurement in experiments of this kind, but
                    as a literary device, it is not always present within a form that has long held
                    strong ties with the forces of late capitalism. When we see the name Patterson,
                    Dumas, or Hitchcock, is that an indication of reliability rather than
                    authenticity; substance rather than style?</div>
