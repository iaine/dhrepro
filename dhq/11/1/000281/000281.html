        <p>Learning how to read <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> is the most important
          skill for studying the history of pre-modern Japan and classical Japanese literature.
          However, the difficulty of acquiring this skill has prevented both scholars and amateurs
          from other fields and countries to work on classical Japanese writings. The <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> project is an attempt to provide accessible resources
          and training on mobile devices for learning <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>,
          and available for free. KuLA, the learning app we developed, has already been downloaded
          more than 36,000 times since its release in February 2016. In this paper, we describe our
          background, aims, and approach of our project, as well as the implementation of KuLA.</p>

        <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The 20th century saw drastic changes in writing systems in many East-Asian countries;
          Mongolia, for instance, introduced the Cyrillic script in 1941 to replace its traditional
          script under the political pressure of the Soviet Union. Vietnam switched its public
          writing system to a Latin-based one from its traditional Chinese-based writing
          system, Chữ nôm. Malaysia also introduced a Latin-based script (<span class="foreign i">Rumi</span>)
          at the beginning of the 20th century. Since the skill of reading historical writings is
          directly linked to familiarity with past writing systems, these countries must equally
          suffer from difficulties in handing down past knowledge written in historical resources to
          their younger generations. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e311">[1]</a> In the case of Japan,
            <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>, a general term for classical
          calligraphic renderings of Japanese characters which used to be common for both publishing
          and handwriting before the end of 19th century, has become an obstacle to accessing
          knowledge recorded in the past.</div>

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The current Japanese writing system consists of two types of characters: 46 syllabic
            <span class="foreign i">kana</span> and thousands of logographic <span class="foreign i">kanji</span>, which are adapted Chinese characters. The modern system
          has been developed since the Meiji Restoration of 1868, and in this process Japanese
          society obsoleted some types of characters and writing styles that used to be common
          before the Meiji period. First, pre-modern Japanese had the option to use different
          characters other than the current <span class="foreign i">kana</span> to denote a single
          syllable. For instance, a <span class="foreign i">kana</span> “す” (pronounced "su") had
          more than five alternative characters (see Figure 1). These variants of <span class="foreign i">kana</span> are called <span class="foreign i">hentaigana</span>,
          which were officially obsoleted by the amended education law announced in 1900. Second, in
          most publications and writings before the Meiji era, <span class="foreign i">kanji</span> had been written mostly in cursive forms that appear today only in
          calligraphy (See Figure 2). As letterpress printing had replaced wood-block printing after
          the Meiji period, this cursive style of writing gradually declined. <span class="foreign i">Kuzushiji</span> is a general term (including hentaigana and cursive <span class="foreign i">kanji</span>) for characters that are not used today. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e350">[2]</a>

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Through the process of modernization in the 20th century, modern Japanese (except trained
          experts) have lost the ability to read <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. A
          scholar of Japanese classical literature Mitsutoshi Nakano estimates in his book that even
          in a humanities faculty less than ten percent of the faculty members can read <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>
          [<a class="ref" href="#nakano2011">Nakano 2011</a>]. Robert Campbell, a scholar of Japanese classical literature
          originally from the US, summarizes this situation: " We read characters in order to learn about Japan in the pre-modern
              era. But ironically, Japanese lost the skill to read these characters in exchange for
              the modernization they have achieved for the last 150 years. Those who rely on printed
              text can learn only small portions of the past Japan. Contrary to European and
              American countries, Japanese have lost the abilities to go back freely to their own
              historical landscapes.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e403">[3]</a>
            "
             (<a class="ref" href="http://www.toppan.co.jp/news/2015/07/newsrelease150703_2.html" onclick="window.open('http://www.toppan.co.jp/news/2015/07/newsrelease150703_2.html'); return false">http://www.toppan.co.jp/news/2015/07/newsrelease150703_2.html</a>) As Campbell implies here, the skill of reading <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> is deeply connected to the ability to access past knowledge;
            The <cite class="title italic">Kokusho Sōmokuroku</cite> (<cite class="title italic">General
            Catalog of National Books</cite>) [<a class="ref" href="#morisue1963">Morisue et al. 1963</a>], a Japanese reference
          work for books written in Japanese in the pre-modern era, lists more than 450,000 entries,
          most of which are written in <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. It is said that
          the ratio of transcribed books among these entries is less than 1%. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e426">[4]</a> So
          reading <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> is a must-have skill for studying
          historical writings written in Japanese. </div>

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Since the curriculum of Japanese compulsory education doesn't include training for
          reading <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>, this skill has become the exclusive
          ability of scholars of Japanese literature and history, who have access to the original
          materials with few exceptions. Scholars from these two fields have made a lot of effort to
          teach the skill of reading <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> to the general
          public, by means of publishing textbooks and delivering face-to-face lectures; since 2010
          at least nineteen textbooks for teaching <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> have
          been published. However, we believe that these traditional modes of teaching have
          limitations in terms of availability. In fact, there are groups of people inside and
          outside academia with keen interests in learning <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> and reading Japanese classical writings whose needs are not
          satisfied by these traditional pedagogical tools, as we point out later in detail. In
          order to appeal to these groups, some new methods that make use of modern digital media
          must be developed.</div>

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">What role can digital humanities play in developing such methods? Digital Humanities has
          an apparent advantage that other fields of humanities do not have: direct access to both
          classical writings and digital technology. In other words, digital humanities has a
          potential ability to offer learning materials of <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> to the general public efficiently with the help of digital media.
          Also, since the loss of the ability to read written historical resources in the modern era
          is not a phenomenon specific to Japan, building a model for teaching an obsolete or dead
          writing system with the help of digital media could possibly contribute to the humanities
          in a wider area of the world. This would make digital humanities even more important in
          the general field of humanities. </div>

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> project, which we will describe in this
          paper, is an interdisciplinary project started in 2015 through the cooperation of scholars
          of Japanese literature, linguistics and digital humanities. It
          aims to build a mobile learning application for providing accessible
          resources and training for reading <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. We call our
            app KuLA (<span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> learning application), which is
          already available for free both on the App Store and Google Play [<a class="ref" href="#hashimoto2016">Hashimoto et al 2016</a>]. In this paper, we will describe the target and approach of
          our project, the features KuLA provides, and the results we achieved after launching KuLA.

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7"> As we mentioned in the previous section, there are groups who have keen interest in
            <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> but not satisfied with the traditional
          approach of teaching. To be more precise, there is a growing need recently for the skill
          of reading kuzusjiji among the following three groups: </div>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8"> (1) Scholars of Japanese studies outside Japan, who used to rely mostly on transcribed
          or translated works for their research. Thanks to the recent progress of the digitization
          of cultural heritage materials in Japan, they now have access to a large number of digital
          images of pre-modern Japanese texts without having to visit Japan. Because of this change,
          acquiring the ability to read <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> has become quite
          important to eliminating the only barrier that prevents them from using these resources
          and efforts are being made to expand <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> literacy.
          For instance, Laura Moretti, who teaches pre-modern and early modern Japanese literature

          that scientists read these classical writings, but there are some fields that need to
          investigate written historical resources to elucidate past phenomena that cannot be
          observed directly. A good example of such a field is seismology. Since the instrumental
          recordings of earthquakes in Japan began only after the end of the 19th century, studies
          of past earthquakes have to rely on written historical records to a considerable extent.
          For this reason some Japanese seismologists read classical writings written with <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> for their research with the help of humanities
          scholars. There is even an academic association dedicated to historical earthquake recordings.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e502">[5]</a> Since the great earthquake and
          tsunami that struck the  Tōhoku area in 2011, Japanese seismologists have become more

          particular, there has recently been a growing number of Japanese female history buffs who
          have become interested in history through playing video games or watching TV dramas based
          on historical materials. These young females are often called reki-jo (歴女), which can
          literally be translated to "history girls".<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e513">[6]</a> The most
          popular game among them, Touken Ranbu, a web browser game developed by Nitroplus and DMM,
          has gained about 1.5 million users as of February 2016 (since its launch in January 2015).
            <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e518">[7]</a> The purpose of this game
          is to defeat evil forces using legendary Japanese swords, which are depicted as attractive
          young men. It’s often reported that the players of Touken Ranbu have formed long lines to
          see actual Japanese swords displayed in history museums. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e523">[8]</a>
          Some of them are also interested in learning <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> in
          order to read historical books on Japanese swords. In fact, when we announced the launch
          of our app on Twitter, we found that about 30% of the total 1750 users who retweeted our

        <h1 class="head">Previous Works and Our Approach</h1>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">A number of textbooks for learning <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> have been
          written. However, there are not so many options available in digitally. Probably the first
          one among them to be released is Kanaclassic developed in 1999, which demonstrates the
          strokes of <span class="foreign i">hentaigana</span> in video and animations [<a class="ref" href="#yang1999">Yang 1999</a>]. The National Institute for Japanese Language and Linguistics
          (NINJAL) provides the images of three volumes from <cite class="title italic">the Tale of
            Genji</cite> as a teaching material on its website [<a class="ref" href="#ninjal2013">NINJAL 2013</a>]; The
          images are accompanied with their transcriptions so that users can practice how to read
            <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. The Hentaigana App [<a class="ref" href="#ucla2015">UCLA and Waseda 2014</a>], which was developed through the collaboration work of UCLA and Waseda University, is
          the first iOS/Android app for learning <span class="foreign i">hentaigana</span>. The
          Hentaigana app offers a flashcards-like feature that enables users to memorize the 323
          types of <span class="foreign i">hentaigana</span> it includes quickly, with beautifully
          designed background pictures. </div>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Our basic standpoint is that the learning process of <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> goes through multiple stages, and each stage requires different
          learning materials and training. Thus our approach is a more complex than those focused on
          a specific ability. Based on experience of teaching <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> in university classes for years, we reached the conclusion that the
          skill of reading <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> is composed of the following
          three elements, which are acquired in different stages of learning:</div>
        <div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item"><span class="hi bold">Basic knowledge of character shapes.</span> This is the basis for
            recognizing both <span class="foreign i">hentaigana</span> and cursive <span class="foreign i">kanji</span>. Most of the learners of <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> start their learning process by memorizing a table that lists
              <span class="foreign i">hentaigana</span>. This ability is efficiently trained
            through flashcard-based exercises, as in the Hentaigana app, which takes this approach.
            In this regard, however, it is important to memorize characters in conjunction with
            other characters since the shapes of characters change in accordance with the strokes
            with which the handwriting is performed. Thus the teaching materials for this ability
            should contain word-level examples of <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> as well
            as those of single characters.</li><li class="item"><span class="hi bold">A decent amount of exercises for reading actual texts.</span>
            Memorizing character shapes is, of course, not enough to be able to read <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. Learners need to integrate knowledge of each
            character organically in order to get the meaning of a single sentence, just like they
            do when they read texts written in a foreign language. Also, learners will often have to
            make a guess as to the meaning from the context of a phrase and they may not have clear
            background knowledge on the text when some part of it that they are reading is damaged
            or when the handwriting in it is not clear. These abilities are developed mostly through
            reading actual texts.</li><li class="item"><span class="hi bold">Social connections with mentors and fellows.</span> This is the
            hardest thing to find when you learn <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> outside
            the faculties of Japanese literature or history. Even if you have mastered the abilities
            described above, you will be very likely to encounter some characters completely
            illegible to you. This is the sort of moment when you need someone to ask for help,
            which you could find easily if you belonged to a faculty of Japanese literature or
            history. The previous works for learning <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>
            don't seem to address this difficulty, but the lack of mentors and fellows to give you
            help and advice can significantly delay the learning process and undermine the
            motivation of a learner.</li></ul></div>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">On the other hand, it is not realistic to make the app cover all the books published in
          the pre-modern era, since characters and writing styles vary across time. Thus we limited
          our target to writings from the Edo period (1603-1868). This limitation will not be a
          large hindrance to our purpose because it is said that 90% of the classical writings that
          still remain today are from this period [<a class="ref" href="#nakano2011">Nakano 2011</a>].</div>

          includes sample images and comments for 102 <span class="foreign i">hentaigana</span>
          and 176 <span class="foreign i">kanji</span> characters. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e662">[10]</a> These characters are selected

          lesson is made up of 19-24 characters. Each character has several sample images both in
          single-character forms and in multiple-character forms (See Figure 3). The total 3,000
          sample images were taken from the NIJS's digital collection of classical Japanese works.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e678">[12]</a> By browsing these examples the

          feature to check if the user can correctly recognize the characters, where a randomly
          selected character image is shown and the user is required to input how to read the
          character in the text field below the image (See Figure 4). Then Shimimaru, the mascot of

        <h1 class="head">Technical Considerations</h1>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Through the development phase we have made use of open source software and cloud-based
          services that offer free plans with limited usages. These products and services made it
          possible to build KuLA with a very small cost. </div>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">One of the major challenges in building KuLA was the collection of example <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. Each use case included in KuLA contains the image
          data of a character and metadata such as the title of the source document, how to read the
          character, etc. How can one collect 3,000 images of characters with metadata efficiently
          from digitized historical writings? For this task we developed a simple cloud
          server-client system which consists of a web server and a Chrome extension (a type of
          plugin that runs on the Google Chrome web browser). The Chrome extension we developed
          enables users to crop an arbitrary region in an open tab and input metadata on the
          image (see Figure 7). The cropped image and metadata are automatically sent to the web
          server that we built with Ruby on Rails running on Heroku<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e777">[14]</a>, a cloud
          Platform-as-a-Service run by Salesforce.com. The web server stores the metadata into the
          relational database on Heroku and transfers the uploaded image to Cloudinary<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e782">[15]</a>, a cloud image
          storage service that provides the REST API to store and manipulate image data. The image
          and its metadata immediately become accessible on the Web, so that every team member can
          share the progress of the image collection.<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e787">[16]</a></div>

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24">Another challenging task was to have our app run both on iOS and Android; these two
          operation systems require developers code in two different languages: Objective-C (Swift)
          and Java. Building a single app in two different languages was not acceptable in terms of
          cost and time. So as a workaround we built our app with Ionic<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e803">[17]</a>, an
          HTML5 mobile framework based on AngularJS<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e808">[18]</a> and Apache Cordova<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e813">[19]</a>.
          Ionic offers the mobile-optimized UI components that make it possible to build and test a
          mobile app quickly, as well as the APIs to interact with the device’s native functions
          such as camera and file storage. You can build an Ionic app with only HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript without coding in the native languages required by both operating systems. So
          we could generate distributions both for iOS and Android from a single source code.</div>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">In order to implement the community features we needed a server for receiving and

              Firebase<a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e822">[20]</a>, a cloud-based backend service for mobile and
          web applications. The user messages are stored in a key-value store controlled by Firebase

          getting at least 10,000 downloads in total. KuLA was released on both the App Store and
          Google Play on February 18, 2016. One of the authors announced the launch of our app on
          his Twitter account. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e839">[21]</a> The reactions to
          the announcement were immediate and massive; this tweet was retweeted more than 1,700
          times and favorited by 2,000 users in three days after the launch. On March 16, the total
          number of downloads reached 10,000. Thus our initial goal was achieved within the first
          month after the release. As of October 10, KuLA has been downloaded a total of 36,649
          times: 19,400 on the AppStore and 17,249 on Google Play. Although most downloads have been
          made from Japan, there has been a small but constant number of downloads from other
          countries: the United States (214 downloads), Korea (168 downloads), Germany (47
          downloads), and Italy (44 downloads). We received a message from an Italian scholar who

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28"> Another metric that indicates how users reacted to our app is the retention rate, the
          ratio of users who launched the app after installing it over time. Figure 9 shows the
          retention rate of KuLA during May 1-31, 2016. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e859">[24]</a> In this period, about 2,900 users downloaded KuLA, 35.4% of them
          launched it one month after they downloaded it, and 9.55% are still using after three
          months. The retention rate after five months went down to 2.65%. Are these rates high or
          low? Localytics, a business analytics company that specializes in mobile markets, provided
          benchmarks for apps in the Business, Education and Technology category based on their
          analysis of more than 37,000 apps. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e862">[25]</a>
          According to their benchmarks, the average monthly retention rate of apps in this category
          for the first three months is 32%, 21%, and 15%. Thus the retention rate of KuLA in May
          1-31 is higher than the average in the first month, but lower in the next two months. This
          means that there is still work to be done to improve the support of users' long-term
          learning. </div>

          learning <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>, stated that the test feature of our
          app gives too much focus on the user's ability to decide how to read a single character,
          which is not appropriate because there are cases where you have to decide how to read a
          character based on its context. <a class="noteRef" href="#d8309e882">[26]</a> Some users
          also suggested that our app should implement a feature to allow users to trace the strokes
          of <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> characters by moving their fingers, so that
          they can memorize the shapes of the characters efficiently using their fingers and eyes.
          Both the criticism and suggestion we received have reasonable points. We are planning to
          include improvements to reflect these criticisms and suggestions in the next release.</div>

        <h1 class="head">User Engagement in the Community Module</h1>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">As described earlier, the aim of the community module is to enable online communications
          and mutual support for learning among users. We shall examine how much user engagement has
          actually taken place for the last seven months after the release. From February to October
          2016, 68 posts and 233 comments on these posts have been created by total 60 users. Out of
          68 posts, 6 are just greetings but another 61 posts (91%) are questions with attached
          images of <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. And 57 (85%) have recieved at least
          one comment from other users. The average time that it takes for each post to recieve a
          first comment is 43.4 hours. Thus users can have a high expectation that they will get a
          response within a few days if you post a question. </div>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">Here are some examples of actual user comments. A user named Takushi Misoi, who is trying
          to read a manuscript about a traditional festival that has been held in his hometown for
          ages, posted the pictures of some part of the manuscript that he was unable to read by
          himself (see Figure 9). Four other users responded to his question and gave suggestions on
          how to read these parts. Through the 21 messages exchanged among these users, his question
          has almost been resolved. Another user Hitomi Kinto posted a picture of a hanging roll on
          which some waka poem is written with <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>, saying
          she couldn’t read this poem at all. One user soon pointed out that the poem was one first
          composed in <span class="foreign i">Teijiin-Uta-Awase (亭子院歌合)</span>, a historical waka
          poetry contest held in 913. <div class="figure">

        <div class="counter"><a href="#p32">32</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p32">The kinds of communications as we have envisioned are certainly taking place in the
          community module. However, considering the download count of KuLA for the last seven
          months, we have to say that the amount of engagement by users is still small and there
          remains a lot to be improved in this feature. Our current hypothesis is that the lack of
          mechanisms to motivate users is preventing further participation from users. In the next
          update planned for the end of 2016, we will add some additional features to make up for
          this flaw: voting on comments, a leaderboard based on voting, push notifications, etc. </div>

        <h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">In this paper, we described the background, approach, method and result of our project to
          build a mobile app for learning <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. The number of
          downloads our app has received in a month clearly shows that there is a great deal of
          interest in Japanese society about its obsolete writing system: <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>. A user named Megumi Kato says in her review of our app (which she
          posted on Google Play) that she was hoping to learn <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> but didn’t know what to do at all. While traditional humanities
          have failed to offer people like her opportunities to learn <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span>, our mobile app could provide her with a starting point for
          learning, available for free. Also, the high ratings given by users of our app indicate
          that our complex approach for teaching <span class="foreign i">kuzushiji</span> meets
          their requirements quite well, although there is still room for improvement in our
          approach and implementation (as shown in the criticisms and suggestions made by users of
          our app). One of the major advantages of developing a learning material as a mobile app is
          that the developer can continue to respond to the users’ needs by continuing to update the
          app. </div>
        <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">As mentioned earlier, there are many countries (especially in East Asia) whose
          traditional writing systems have been changed or completely replaced with other systems in
          the process of modernization. Although further investigation is needed, It is very likely
          that people in these countries share the same interests in learning their historical
          writing systems. Making a survey of the situations in these countries and developing
          applications for the support of learning their traditional writing systems may be an
          important task for digital humanities, which is becoming a global academic discipline.</div>
