                <p> In this paper we expand Stefan Gradmann’s question at WWW2012 "Thinking in the graph: will Digital Humanists ever do
                        so?" to consider whether humanists, more generally than just
                        "digital" ones, might do thinking that is, at least to
                    some useful degree, "in the graph" too. Drawing on the
                    experience of the Pliny project, and recent work done within that project to
                    explore how Pliny materials might connect with the semantic web, we explore ways
                    in which structured "graph-like" thinking might be revealed
                    in — to "peek out" from — parts of humanities research that
                    is common to digital and non-digital humanists alike. Out of this, we propose a
                    number of different ways that scholars might engage with the Semantic Web, and
                    provide examples – arising from the building of a prototype extension to Pliny –
                    of how these engagements could be dealt with. We also explore the challenge of
                    ambiguity and incompleteness in scholarship, explain how 2D space operates in
                    Pliny to cope, to some degree at least, with these issues, and consider the
                    boundaries between the expressiveness of 2D space and the formal graph model of
                    the Semantic Web. We end by proposing several possible avenues for future work
                    that arise from our work so far.</p>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In his WWW2012 presentation Stefan Gradmann raised the question "Thinking in the graph: will Digital Humanists ever do
                        so?"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#gradmann2012">Gradmann 2012</a>, slide 2]. His aim there was to consider how
                    the Semantic Web [<a class="ref" href="#berners2001">Berners-Lee et al 2001</a>] and its data oriented technologies
                    such as RDF [<a class="ref" href="#cyganiak2014">Cyganiak, Wood and Lanthaler 2014</a>] might be applied to
                    humanities-oriented materials. Like Berners-Lee and others (see [<a class="ref" href="#berners2009">Berners-Lee 2009</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#berners2010">Berners-Lee 2010</a>]), he claimed that
                    digital humanists could exploit data made available through these approaches in
                    ways that would not have been practical in the past and thereby enable the
                    creation of entirely new research results.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Given that he was speaking about the data-oriented Semantic Web, Gradmann
                    naturally took a data-oriented perspective in his paper, drawing on work done
                    with structured text and databases. In this paper, however, we intend to start
                    with what will appear to be a very similar question as his, but will view it
                    from what will become a very different starting point. As a result, we believe
                    that we will have things to say that are quite different from Gradmann. Indeed,
                    we think that however thought-provoking Gradmann’s "thinking
                        in the graph" for <em class="emph">digital humanists</em> might be, taking our
                    perspective allows one to explore the perhaps even more fundamental question:
                        "Thinking in the graph: will Humanists (more generally)
                        ever do so?". It is this more general question that we will explore
                    here.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Perhaps the best bridge from Gradmann’s work into our own comes through what we
                    think of as the significant provocations contained in both the words
                        "thinking" and "graph" in Gradmann’s question. We will return to
                    the "thinking" part a little later in this paper, but let us start with the
                        "graph" word right away, since those readers who are not familiar with
                    the underpinnings of the Semantic Web might be puzzled by its appearance here.
                    The Semantic Web is an approach to dealing with globally distributed and
                    interconnected highly structured data. For any domain to which it is applied,
                    the material it represents is captured in an (often very large) set of simple
                    assertions which are recorded as "triples". Each triple is made up of two
                    digital entities representing a <em class="emph">subject</em> and <em class="emph">object</em>
                    joined by a third digital object (called a <em class="emph">predicate</em>) that
                    expresses a connection between them. All three components of the triple can be
                    expressed as WWW URIs, which gives them a global scope. It turns out that a set
                    of interrelated triples-assertions of this kind can be represented in what is
                    called a mathematical <em class="emph">graph</em> – which is a collection of nodes with
                    connections between them. Indeed, a collection of such triples is called an
                        <em class="emph">RDF Graph</em> in RDF’s <cite class="title italic">Concepts and Abstract
                        Syntax</cite> document [<a class="ref" href="#cyganiak2014">Cyganiak, Wood and Lanthaler 2014</a>, sections 1.1 and 3]. So, Gradmann's question is meant to focus our attention on whether digital
                    humanists can represent things that interest them in terms of highly structured
                    data (the assertions through triples) that can be represented satisfactorily
                    using a mathematical graph.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Gradmann’s example of humanities materials in his talk are rather data-oriented
                    to start with, so one can readily see how using RDF provides an appropriate
                    representation of their materials. Indeed, we here at DDH have had more than 20
                    years of experience with data-oriented collaborative project work such as that
                    on structured prosopography (see [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2004">Bradley and Short 2004</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#pasin2015">Pasin and Bradley 2015</a>], for example). We can certainly agree with Gradmann
                    that the products of our data-oriented projects also can be thought of as both
                    clearly useful products of humanities research that are useful to other
                    humanities researchers, and yet are compatible with this data-oriented approach.
                    Furthermore, by their nature as graph-oriented structured data they indeed have
                    the potential to be suitable for further processing in, say, mashups created by
                    independent researchers that might represent new research for the humanities in
                    the way that Gradmann talks about. However, we have already broadened Gradmann’s
                    phrase from <em class="emph">digital humanities</em> to <em class="emph">the humanities</em>, and
                    thus must include research work in the humanities outside of the specifically
                        <em class="emph">digital</em> humanities. The fundamental question, then, is how, if
                    at all, the more general processes and products of humanities scholarship (which
                    conventionally produces research product as texts and not as data) are
                    compatible with the Semantic Web’s graph representation which is centered on a
                    formalisation of highly structured data-like materials. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">This distinction between data-oriented humanities projects and other humanities
                    research is important because, as interesting as these data-oriented projects
                    are, one must surely say that these data-oriented projects require a way of
                    thinking about humanities materials that is quite foreign to the bulk of
                    humanist scholars. In fact, we do not believe that structured data resources
                    themselves, or mashup-like projects that combine data to form new expressions of
                    existing materials from them, can be called <em class="emph">typical</em> humanities
                    research. These structured data digital resource projects are things that most
                    conventional humanist scholars can hopefully appreciate to be of value, and
                    might well be things they would use as resources in their own work, but they are
                    not things that they would think of producing as research themselves. Indeed, it
                    is the very mathematical-like structural formality of these data-oriented
                    products that makes them seem rather foreign. Is there, then, a place for the
                    mathematical graph and its associated formal approaches for this majority of
                    scholars who view their principal research sources as primary and secondary
                    texts and do not produce resources that obviously work as graph-like datasets
                    but instead appear in the form of books and articles? </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Our ideas here grow out of our work on the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>
                    project [<a class="ref" href="#pliny2009">Pliny 2009</a>], which was started by one of the authors
                    (Bradley) as far back as 2004 and which proposed a kind of digital framework to
                    support scholarship. <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> is meant to support
                    humanities scholarship, and, as we shall explain in this paper, reveals a way to
                    connect scholarship to the Semantic Web that takes quite a different tack from
                    the data-oriented Linked Data / Mashup paradigm implied by Gradmann’s 2012
                    paper. Instead, we believe that our approach suggests how a Semantic Web
                    framework (while still having a data-oriented focus) could be made to fit to an
                    interesting degree with scholarly research practice that is not apparently
                    data-oriented at all. Thus, much of the rest of this paper aims to explore, with
                        <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> as the exemplar, how this connection
                    between traditional scholarly practice (which is very different from the work
                    involved in the creation of our data-oriented resources) and Semantic Web and
                    Linked Data ideas might be usefully made.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">We offer this article, then, as a kind of thought piece about the connection
                    between traditional humanities scholarly thinking and formal models like
                    mathematical graphs. Like Gradmann, we also believe that there is a need for a
                    discussion not so much "about infrastructure but about epistemological
                            foundations"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#gradmann2012">Gradmann 2012</a>, slide 29]. Indeed, we believe that there is real work to be done to engage the
                    Semantic Web with humanities scholarship, and that it will best arise out of
                    thinking about how the epistemological underpinnings for traditional scholarship
                    might relate to the band of technologies often called Knowledge Representation,
                    and in particular to the formal structures the Semantic Web offers. We cannot
                    claim that our model, as described here, provides <em class="emph">the definitive</em>
                    answer to this issue, but it does provide at least a plausible
                        <em class="emph">approach</em> that can lead us to ask relevant questions about
                    possible connections between formal data and humanities scholarship, and, we

                    article from a somewhat theoretical reflection about research to explore one way
                    in which the work of scholarship, as <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> supports
                    it, might explicitly map to the formalisms of the Semantic Web. In this way we
                    propose a model of how the Semantic Web could connect formally with <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s structures, and through them, to these
                    conventional, non-data oriented, parts of scholarship. Finally, we look at some

                    with the formal structures of systems like the Semantic Web. We have, in [<a class="ref" href="#Bradley2014">Bradley 2014</a>], touched upon some of the issues that explain why so
                    much humanist research is presented in terms of, as Hayden White explains it,
                        "a narrative prose discourse", and why language
                    is used as the expression of this research. It is precisely <em class="emph">because</em>
                    it is "imprecise and slippery"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#bodenhamer2008">Bodenhamer 2008</a>, 224] that it is used. See, for example, [<a class="ref" href="#louch1969">Louch 1969</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#rüsen1987">Rüsen 1987</a>] for a perspective on the nature of prose for
                    humanities research from a historiographical point of view. As we considered in

                    of research fits obviously rather uneasily with the clear binary-like Cartesian

                    of humanities research – reading and writing – might appear to many twenty-first
                    century <em class="emph">digital</em> humanists as representing exactly the aspects of
                    humanities research that are outside their domain of interest. Nonetheless, we
                    will make the case here that there is good reason to try to find potential
                    digital aspects of them that could fit with the perspective of a digital
                    humanities agenda. First, and perhaps most obviously, this is because even DH
                    techniques such as, say, those associated with Franco Moretti’s <em class="emph">distant
                        reading</em> – which relies on structured, formal data as input – are only
                    a part of an entire scholarly process and cannot be full replacements, by
                    themselves, for traditional scholarly methods – this even for DH researchers
                    themselves. The new data-oriented DH methods such as distant reading are often
                    cast as borrowing of aspects of scientific methodology for the humanities. In
                    the sciences, however, the use of scientific instruments and the collecting and
                    processing of data from them generally is not considered to be the be-all and
                    end-all of scientific work – one has to then publish articles that interpret
                    this data: articles that are published either in traditional science journals,
                    or perhaps nowadays online in major science research repositories. Indeed,
                    scientific progress is made through the publication of ideas that arise
                        <em class="emph">from</em> this data through the scientist’s thinking about, and
                    developing an interpretation of them. The final research product for much
                    data-oriented scientific research is still an article in scientific prose.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11"> In a similar way, formal data-driven DH approaches such as distant reading,
                    social network analysis, or text mining cannot eliminate, on their own, the need
                    for scholars to think about what they have found through these new techniques
                    and then to present their understanding of the significance that has emerged
                    from their exploration. It <em class="emph">is</em> true that, unlike traditional
                    humanists, the DH-driven scholar may not only be reading books as sources for
                    their research and may well be also drawing on these new DH approaches for
                    insights and ideas. However, Moretti's work using distant reading techniques to
                    explore the emergence of the form of the novel was not finished when the distant
                    reading DH-part, the number crunching and graphing, was completed. He still
                    needed to think about the meaning of his data and its analysis and indeed to
                    write it up in that most traditional of scholarly communications: the monograph
                        [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>]. Furthermore, although his ideas arose, in
                    part, out of his engagement with formal data, they also came out of his more
                    general understanding of western literary and social culture. He put these two
                    kinds of understanding together, added some further substantial insights of his
                    own, and produced his book out of this effort. Moretti's practice is not unique.
                    For the great majority of DH researchers, the work of using the DH methodologies
                    and their tools/instruments (such as, say, those found in big data
                    methodologies) is not the whole story of their research activities either.
                    Significant intellectual work continues, following after the application of
                    these tools, in that phase of research between exploration and publication. So,
                    we intend in this paper to shift our gaze from the input/exploration part of the
                    research to the work that follows after it and that results in an original
                    written text as the product of the research – the external evidence of
                    scholarship. How do we fit it with a representation of scholarship that is
                    highly structured in the form that RDF and the other associated Semantic Web
                    technologies are?</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">At first glance at least, as we remarked earlier, scholarly humanities writing as
                    the expression of research output does not appear to fit well with the
                    structured methodologies of the Semantic Web or with Gradmann’s question about
                    the place of graph-thinking in the humanities. Two things, however, begin to
                    hint at a <em class="emph">place</em> for structured data of the kind represented by the
                    Semantic Web (SW) in scholarly writing. If we look closely at most articles or
                    books presenting research in the humanities, we will usually see that there
                        <em class="emph">is</em> some formal structure at least implied in the text, both
                    directly evident (first) in the structure represented by the flow of the
                    argument, but also (second) in the identification and naming of themes, concepts
                    and their connections that are presented in them. These named themes and
                    concepts can begin, perhaps right off, to look something like things that can be
                    expressed and shared by Semantic Web technologies, particularly ontologies. They
                    at least hint at structure of the kind with which the Semantic Web operates.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">However, there is an important difference between these conceptual structures and
                    those that often are thought of as characterising the Semantic Web’s ontologies
                    and other semantic structures. The SW, through its ontology component, aims to
                    support machine-based selection and manipulation of data by providing a formal
                    representation of established knowledge about the world that is both based upon
                    a <em class="emph">shared</em> human understanding of it and that is simultaneously
                    accessible to the technology. Indeed, it is through this formalised shared
                    understanding of the structured data that much of the potential power of the
                    Semantic Web comes. In the SW the expression of this shared understanding of the
                    data is expressed in the formalisms of what are called computer
                        <em class="emph">ontologies</em>. Thomas Gruber's [<a class="ref" href="#gruber1993">Gruber 1993</a>] early
                    description of an ontology as a shared common understanding of a collection of
                    materials expressed using a formal system reveals this approach, and indeed the
                    emphasis in the Semantic Web’s ontologies for a particular domain is almost
                    always centered on the formal definition of widely agreed terms and ideas.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">In contrast to this, however, as Guetzkow <span class="foreign i">et al</span>
                    remind us in their article "What is Originality in the
                        Humanities and the Social Sciences?"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#guetzkow2004">Guetzkow et al 2004</a>], humanities scholars want to say something
                        <em class="emph">new</em> about their materials, and hence will generally not want to
                    refer simply to ideas contained in an existing mature intellectual framework
                    that could (perhaps — and only "perhaps") be represented in a formal
                    Semantic Web ontology. As Guetzkow <span class="foreign i">et al</span> state "[h]umanists and historians clearly privilege
                            originality in approach"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#guetzkow2004">Guetzkow et al 2004</a>, 190]. In their interviews of peer review panels in the humanities they found
                    that "panelists described originality ... in terms of the
                            novelty of the overall approach used by the researcher (who is 'bringing a fresh perspective')"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#guetzkow2004">Guetzkow et al 2004</a>, 192]. Humanities scholars, then, are encouraged to develop their
                        <em class="emph">own</em> voice and perspective on their material that is different
                    from that currently established within their discipline. Their work will
                    usually, of course, be grounded in some existing ideas shared with academic
                    colleagues, but the best of it will also extend or perhaps even more
                    fundamentally break with past models by introducing new themes, concepts, or
                    connections. If it was possible – and this is a big "if" – to have a formal
                    representation of a set of widely shared ideas for a particular humanities
                    discipline (an ontology rich enough to capture the current understanding around
                    the issues of, say, colonialism), then an original piece of scholarship that
                    fits with this colonialism field might then be expressible <em class="emph">in part</em>
                    as a kind of linked data connection to these established concepts. Even then,
                    however, it will also almost certainly contain at least some material that is
                    original with the researcher and that does not link to any such existing shared,
                    formal, representation of the field. Indeed, perhaps one could claim that the
                    aim of all scholarship in the humanities and elsewhere is to challenge the
                    boundaries of shared knowledge and understanding. For this reason, materials
                    that represent new scholarship would seem inevitably to go outside the natural
                    domain of SW ontologies.</div>

                    eventually appears as prose text, the process to get to this presentation in
                    prose is not captured by simply sitting down one day and letting the paper
                    simply flow out. There is a process going on from which the ideas and how to
                    present them emerge. We will call this process <em class="emph">interpretation
                        development</em>, and the process of emergence that it represents is one
                    that takes ideas for this interpretation from vagueness to relative clarity. Any
                    structure for this interpretation does not just appear, fully formed, in the
                    author's head at the time the article was being written. It emerges after
                    substantial engagement with the materials with which s/he was working. Before
                    the article writing begins, but as a part of the research process that might
                    lead to the article, it is likely that the ideas are still only partially
                    formed, and cannot be expressed in the rigid formalisms of, say, a Semantic Web
                    ontology; indeed they most likely will not be initially ready for expression in
                    the seemingly less mathematically formal medium of written prose text either. At
                    this stage the ideas are in fact, let us say, <em class="emph">pre-ontological</em>, and
                    bringing Semantic Web ontology technologies into the picture at this point would
                    appear to bring formalism to bear too soon in the process of developing them.
                    Considerable thinking needs to happen after the engagement with the materials
                    being studied before an interpretation of these materials is mature enough to be

                    beginning of this paper and to his use of the word "thinking" in it: for it
                    is in the work between the gathering of materials and the writing of a personal
                    interpretation of them that a lot of thinking has to happen. By exploring issues
                    in the formally challenging context of more mainstream research outputs –
                    articles, books, etc. – produced in the humanities and the kind of thinking that
                    goes into their production, we believe that one can discover places for
                    structure and graphs there as well. We believe that François Lachance’s
                    object-oriented, embodied, understanding of thinking (quoted at the top of this
                    paper) suggests something important about the thinking process that goes on in
                    traditional scholarship, and reveals an aspect of structure in that thinking
                    that can be latched onto. Although perhaps the outward expression of this
                    thinking-process may not at first look much like "thinking in the
                        graph" as it is usually modelled in the Semantic Web, it seems to
                    us that there are in fact bits and pieces of a graph approach that might well
                    peek out, as it were, from what we can discern there and these bits of a graph
                    model can suggest ways to consider, both positively and negatively, possible
                    connections between the graph, the Semantic Web, and traditional scholarly
                    thinking in the humanities. We intend to explore some of these bits of graph
                    model thinking that we believe are "peeking out" not so much
                    to provide definitive answers about how they work, but to encourage further work
                    by those familiar with the Semantic Web about the place of Semantic Web-like
                    formal structure in traditional, non-data oriented, scholarship, and how what
                    structure we find in it might be engaged to facilitate that aspect of

                    began in 2004 and started with building a tool (also called <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>) that could support the <em class="emph">process</em> of doing
                    humanities scholarship. Although apparently often thought of as a kind of
                    annotation tool, <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> did not turn out to be
                    particularly about annotation, or at least not about annotation in isolation
                    from its place in scholarship. Instead, it came to represent how a digital
                    approach to annotation could fit with other thoughts about the representation of
                    ideas. In this view, digital annotation became only a starting point of
                    research, and <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> became a tool that aimed to
                    support a fuller range of humanities scholarship activities than those that an
                    annotation tool would have done by itself. Furthermore, the work with the ideas
                    that <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> was exploring led us to come to a view
                    about how the "thinking" parts of conventional scholarly methodology that
                    is used not only by non-DH humanists, but by DH-oriented humanists too, could be
                    usefully connected to the new DH instrument-oriented approaches such as text
                    visualisation, text mining, etc. and their tools (see [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2012">Bradley 2012</a>]).</div>

                    only on the production of the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> software, the
                    software has acted within the project as a thought-piece. It allowed us to
                    experiment rather broadly with questions of what place there might be for
                    technology in both fully conventional scholarship and those aspects of DH
                    practice that, although informed by new data and approaches, continues to also
                    follow conventional scholarly methods: observing, thinking about and
                    interpreting what one has seen, and presenting it. It is this aspect of what the
                        <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> software was for within the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> project that connects, we think, with Gradmann's
                    view [<a class="ref" href="#gradmann2012">Gradmann 2012</a>, slide 29], mentioned earlier, that an
                    investigation of the epistemological foundations of scholarship was where the
                    issues were located. The authors of this present paper are not equipped to write
                    here about epistemology in a philosophical way; however, we hope that the thrust
                    of this paper – indeed the work in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> from near
                    its very beginnings in 2004 – has something to offer to this epistemological
                    discussion that Gradmann seems to think is necessary. The intent in our paper is
                    to draw attention to <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>'s model for the process
                    of scholarship – both conventional and DH-driven – and to explore how it might
                    connect to some degree with the new developments of knowledge representation in
                    the Semantic Web.</div>

                    in [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2003">Bradley 2003</a>]. However, thoughts about what kind of software
                        <em class="emph">could</em> be more broadly useful to humanities researchers became
                    clearer upon Bradley’s discovery of the work of Brockman <span class="foreign i">et al</span> in their 2001 CLIR report entitled <cite class="title italic">Scholarly Work in the Humanities</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="#brockman2001">Brockman et al 2001</a>]. There one could see the central place of reading
                    in scholarship, and the significance of notetaking while reading. Similar ideas
                    about scholarship and notetaking from the perspective of an historian also
                    appear in the work of Ann Blair in her studies on the history of notetaking [<a class="ref" href="#blair2003">Blair 2003</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#blair2004">Blair 2004</a>]. There she claims that personal notes constitute a
                        "central but often hidden phase in the transmission of
                        knowledge"

                    is that in almost any substantive humanities scholarly research venture one
                    expects to start out with only an ill-defined sense of the issues one is
                    interested in. Indeed, as far back as 1997 John Lavagnino observes this aspect
                    of notetaking when he observes that reading was not "a mere
                        collection of data". Instead, he claims that the role of reading in
                    scholarly research can be found in the fact that it "generates reactions" in the reader that "subsequently" (note the use of the word) one could seek to "describe or explain"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#lavagnino1997">Lavagnino 1997</a>, 114]. Thus, the mere act of <em class="emph">taking</em> of notes and/or annotation
                    does not, by itself, capture the central place of these notes in doing the
                    research. Instead, it is important to see how the notes might
                        <em class="emph">subsequently</em> assist their owner in the gradual development of
                    new ideas that would eventually become the primary result of the research
                    work.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">In this light we can see a problem with much of the current work on digital
                    annotation when it is applied to the task of supporting scholarship. On one
                    hand, several annotation tools have been developed to support simple digital
                    textual annotation – linking a bit of text that can act as a comment to
                    something you are reading. Although this is useful for, say, adding public
                    commentary to a text for teaching purposes (see discussion in this vein in [<a class="ref" href="#bessette2015">Bessette 2015</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#dean2015">Dean 2015</a>]), by itself it
                    doesn't serve the needs of the researcher particularly well because, although it
                    could be used as a way to record responses to the text in the way Lavagnino
                    describes, that is all one can do with the annotations. It leaves the user there
                    – at the beginning of a process – without good broader access to these notes
                    that s/he can subsequently use. In contrast to this "textual" annotation
                    approach, other work has been carried out which has been given the general name
                    of <cite class="title italic">Semantic Annotation</cite> (e.g. [<a class="ref" href="#grassi2013">Grassi et al 2013</a>]. This approach has become another way to think about
                    annotation in the context of the Semantic Web and it allows one to link material
                    in a text to elements of a formal Semantic Web structure such as an ontology.
                    Unfortunately, as we explained above, Semantic Web annotation would seem to
                    bring in the formal structure of the linked ontology in too soon; trying to
                    apply an approach suitable for a predefined, formal, interpretive model to the
                    beginning of the process before – in the case of much research in the humanities
                    – a model is available. Although both "simple text" and "semantic"
                    annotation are useful tools, neither engages adequately by themselves with the
                    process of scholarly research.</div>

                    struggling with emerging vague, incompletely defined, ideas, and only after a
                    good period of time does some degree of clarity emerge, a process that we
                    described as <em class="emph">pre-ontological</em> earlier in this paper. Once one begins
                    to see interpretation building as this kind of a process, with perhaps a
                        "clear-ish" conception emerging near its end, the
                    question begins to reveal itself as being not only about formal models for the
                    completed interpretation, but also about how to model the process to help
                    someone <em class="emph">develop</em> it. What should a user interface and the formal
                    structure behind it be like in order to help a researcher while they are
                    developing their interpretation — moving from vagueness to a significant degree

                    mining or a visualisation) exploring some material using a computer application.
                    The diagram shows small boxes with links to spots in the source texts and in a
                    DH application display (here represented as a numerical graph). These are the
                    annotations created by the researcher as s/he reads and explores. Initially, at
                    least – attending to Lavagnino's comments earlier – the reader may well not be
                    in a position to attach specific formalisms to these materials since he or she
                    will not have developed the formalisms yet. So, instead, the notes are, most of
                    the time, likely to be bits of personally-written text that captures the "reactions" that the reader hopes to "subsequently describe or explain" (using Lavagnino's
                    words again) by developing a framework for them.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">The middle area corresponds to the interpretation development phase of the
                    research. Initially, in the earliest phases of the work there will not be any
                    objects there. However, as the researcher thinks about the materials s/he has
                    been exploring and works to understand them s/he will endeavour to organise
                    their thoughts into a collection of interrelated concepts, categories, or
                    topics. Thus, Figure 1 has in its middle area references to some of the notes
                    that were originally created by the researcher while reading. In this phase of
                    the research, however, they are reused by being organised under broad categories
                    or topics (only two are shown here, and labelled generically as "concept 1"
                    and "2" rather than with real names that a researcher would use). In
                    addition, these concepts or topics might well be supplemented by new notes that
                    represent new thinking by the researcher about these topics s/he has formally
                    identified. In <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> a note that started out as an
                    annotation (such as the one labelled in Figure 1 as "Note A") can be also
                    referenced in the different context of one of the interpretation's concept
                    objects – it appears twice in this schematic because it then is displayed in two
                    places by <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> itself – first as an annotation
                    attached to the text where it was created, and then a second time when it also
                    appears as connected to the researcher's <span class="hi italic">concept 1</span>. Note
                    that at this note/concept level the notes and their grouping into larger
                    structures begin to show the kinds of formalism that is compatible with
                    structured data.</div>

                    concepts have been recognised), the researcher draws on the ideas she has formed
                    in the interpretation phase to put together materials (often papers) that
                    present them. Now, the work of organising the materials changes to be one that
                    supports the development of a text for an article that presents the ideas that
                    were developed in the interpretation. Although <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> in its publicly available form does not provide a tool to
                    directly link the materials it holds into the text of an article, there has been
                    some preliminary exploration in the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> project
                    of how such a tool might operate – see [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2009">Bradley 2009</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">While looking at Figure 1 we are encouraged to view scholarship as process, and
                    therefore think of this figure as, let us say, a snapshot of the data at a
                    particular point in time. This process is somewhat organic – more like how a
                    tree grows than how a building is built: <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> is
                    not, thus, "project oriented" in its support. In the same way
                    that a tree starts out small with only a couple of branches but gradually
                    becomes more complex as more branches are added, the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> model accommodates a user who needs to start small: first
                    with notes created while reading, and then through the gradual development of
                    ideas in the interpretation stages. As it evolves over time material is likely
                    to develop from left to right, with (as we said earlier) much of the material at
                    first in the "notetaking/reading" area at the left. Each of
                    these three areas is likely, therefore, to develop at a different pace. Like a
                    tree, where some stems become important branches, and others do not, and yet
                    both substantial and minor branches coexist, ideas recorded in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>'s structure exist at any point in time in more
                    than one stage of development and sophistication, with the more successful ones
                    developing more substantially than the less successful. As with a tree, the
                    product of the research – its fruit – is not a one-time-only affair at the end,
                    but a continuing process during the life of the research and might occur many
                    times out of the research structure stored in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>. Figure 1, then, does not represent the research at its end, but
                    at some point during its life in the same way that a photograph of a tree

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p31">31</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p31">In <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>'s conception of scholarly work new ideas
                    that emerge in the mind of the researcher often emerge out of their engagement
                    with materials in the world – often texts in books or articles, but also these
                    days perhaps software applications such as those that support text mining, or
                    text visualisation. The connection between these object-in-the-world and the
                    scholar's own thoughts are often made, as Lavagnino suggests above, through
                    annotation (or, more generally, notetaking). Thus, annotation is a part of the
                    entire <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> framework, and we have done work in
                        <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> to explore annotation and more generally
                    notetaking for a range of digital media, including both support for notetaking
                    for non-digital sources, annotation for media-oriented digital ones such as web
                    pages or PDF documents, and annotation within displays generated by software
                    applications. Indeed, we believe that <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s
                    approach could readily be extended to include support for annotation of temporal
                    media such as sound files or video. As a consequence, the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> approach to annotation within software provides a framework
                    that extends ideas about annotation of media objects into thinking about how
                    scholarly interpretation connects to the new research method of, say, text
                    mining or visualisation. There is an extensive discussion of annotation for
                    other media and for non-media applications and its implication within the
                    context of the displays from software in [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2012">Bradley 2012</a>].</div>

                    in two ways. First, when a researcher opens an object in Pliny with annotations
                    on it, all the annotations are all immediately visible; nothing needs to be
                    clicked on to see any of them. Their immediate presentation like this helps the
                    reader remember <em class="emph">all</em> the thoughts s/he recorded on the page —
                    something that does not happen if the reader had to open each annotation one by
                    one. Second, annotations in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> appear to float
                    on top of a printed text. Like annotation on paper, the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> annotator can make entirely free use of that page to hold
                    his/her annotations and can exploit the spatial sense of the page as part of the
                    expressive toolkit for annotation. In <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>, then,
                    an annotation, as well as linking a target to the annotation, also has itself a
                    place in a 2D space provided by the material it annotates.</div>

                    was, you recall, represented only in the left "reading / exploring" area of
                    Figure 1. How does <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> support the central phase
                    of research: the development of an interpretation? Different researchers might
                    well use different approaches to this task, and <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> is rather open ended in its support for this reason. However,
                    we can illustrate how Pliny helps the researcher through an example which takes
                    one particular approach. Here, the nature of research as a <em class="emph">process</em>
                    plays a rather more prominent role.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">One way to think about this process is as a gradual increase in structure: the
                        <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> user creates more structure in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> as the ideas become clearer and more structured
                    themselves. The best way to see some of the ways that this plays out inside of
                        <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> is to examine more closely the process
                    one could use to create a particular item about a topic called "uses of space
                        for study" – an example first shown, albeit fully formed, in [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2008">Bradley 2008</a>, 273]. Presenting what is actually a temporal

                    but argues that her list is different because it comes from the somewhat

                    done is in the larger 2D space to the right. The <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> user starts off by assembling references to things she is
                    interested in that relate to the topic: in this case four images that show space
                    being used in different ways. Then she adds a reference to a note on another
                    topic she has already created called "Visualisation", which seems to relate

                    in the 2D space to organise them a bit, placing those which seem to be similar
                    in some way close together. One can characterise this kind of activity as the

                    thinking about issues they raise to support the gradually emerging formalising
                    of new ideas. <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> is not project-oriented in its
                    support. It does not require that ideas develop in step towards a sense of
                        "completion". Instead, the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> user can combine ideas that emerge from different areas of
                    his/her work as she pleases. <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> accommodates the
                    co-existence of certain ideas that develop more completely with those that do
                    not. Materials in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> need not ever be
                    finished.</div>

                    Pliny supports a 2D space for annotations that intentionally mimics annotation
                    on paper, and supports the idea that annotations, as tools to assist in
                    research, need to be fully visible whenever their resource is open. Two
                    dimensional space is also used as a central affordance to support the assembly

                    in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> suggests that 2D-space's sense of
                    proximity, with its degree of ambiguity, is more useful at the beginning of the

                    scholarly research, it is time to return to a major theme of this paper: how
                    does the formal structure behind <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>'s support
                    for annotation (figure 2) and concept development (figures 3 to 7) fit with the
                    formalisms of the Semantic Web? If we can see how the two worlds connect
                    together we have, to the extent that <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>'s formal
                    model captures a part of humanities scholarship, a way of thinking about how
                    scholarship fits with the formal world of the Semantic Web as well.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">The authors have explored this potential connection in a very practical way: by
                    creating a rudimentary extension to <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> in the
                    form of a "plugin" that supported the export of <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> materials into RDF and that brought the linked standard
                    representations of the semantic web back into <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>, and that thus allowed Semantic Web or Linked Data URIs to appear
                    as <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> resources. The next section of this paper,
                    then, presents the very specific way in which this prototype plugin represented
                    the mapping from <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> to the Semantic Web and back
                    again. Theoretical considerations may, of course, reveal more than one way to
                    think about how this connection might be expressed and exploited, but as a
                    consequence of the need to actually write code for this plugin, the authors here
                    have explored one particular expression of this connection. Nonetheless, this
                    pragmatic description of our plugin still opens up issues that connect back to
                    the more theoretical discussion we presented earlier in this paper, and we hope
                    readers will interpret this next, rather pragmatic and specific discussion, in
                    that light.<br/></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">Underlying the representation of Pliny materials in RDF is a rudimentary ontology
                    of Pliny's objects. Its major classes are: <ul class="list"><li class="item"><span class="hi italic">Resource</span>: <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>
                            structures a user’s collection of materials as a set of Resources.
                            Resources are sub-classed to represent types of content objects such as
                            Web pages, PDF files or Image files. Pliny is designed to be extensible
                            to new data types, and usually any new data type becomes a subclass of
                            Resource. Importantly, a Pliny <span class="hi italic">note</span> is also a
                            Resource.</li></ul>
                    <ul class="list"><li class="item"><span class="hi italic">Note</span>: As the name suggests, <span class="hi italic">Pliny</span>’s notes serve the purpose of being containers for a
                            short bit of text (for example, textual annotations), but they also
                            provide a 2D space for storing references to other objects. Hence what
                            are described in Pliny documentation as "containment
                                objects" (which usually become the holders for concept items
                            such as our <span class="hi italic">uses of space for study</span> example) are
                            in fact also Notes. From a Semantic Web perspective, since a note and a
                            concept are clearly semantically different things, this conflating of
                            Notes and Concepts is an expressive limitation that could be addressed
                            in a future version of Pliny. Perhaps, in some future version <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> would allow users to define a set of
                            related classes for kinds of containment objects: categories such as
                                "concepts", or "persons", etc.</li><li class="item"><span class="hi italic">Anchor</span>: <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>
                            provides anchors (currently only rectangles, although this could be
                            extended to other shapes) to identify areas on 2D resources such as
                            images or PDF file pages. In an annotation interpretation of Pliny data,
                            a Pliny Anchor can be an annotation’s target.</li><li class="item"><span class="hi italic">Reference</span>: Any resource (note/conceptual
                            object, image, PDF file, etc.) can be referenced from within another
                            resource. In the <span class="hi italic">uses of space for study</span> example
                            above, for example, the inclusion of the <cite class="title italic">Vico
                                Frontispiece</cite> as an example of one of the uses of space was
                            done by means of a reference to the resource that held the frontispiece
                            image.</li><li class="item"><span class="hi italic">Reference type</span>: References can be typed (we saw
                            the typing being applied in Figure 7). As we’ve seen, reference typing
                            enriches the semantic expressiveness substantially, and a <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> user can define any reference type s/he
                            wants, defining, for instance, types such as "is an example of", or
                                "is a commentary on". Thus, reference types could become the
                            basis for a user-based ontology separate from Pliny’s entity ontology we
                            are describing here since, as we shall see, they can be viewed as a set
                            of predicates in exported RDF triples. In addition, when used in the
                            context of annotation, the reference type can also be usefully
                            interpreted as a "kind" of annotation.</li></ul> Now that we have done some thinking about <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s data as RDF data, two quite obvious questions arise:</div>
                <div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item"><span class="hi italic">Reaching out to the Semantic Web</span>: How can the data
                        that we have shown as accumulating inside of <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> be transformed into RDF, the language of the Semantic
                        Web, and</li><li class="item"><span class="hi italic">Drawing in from the Semantic Web</span>: how can the
                        linked data in the Semantic Web be most usefully connected with the model of
                        scholarship that <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> presents?</li></ul></div>

                    the Semantic Web world. To do this we look first at the part of <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> that supports annotation of digital objects (as
                    shown in Figure 2) to see how these annotations might map to the Semantic Web,
                    and then we explore how the concept development part of <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> (shown in Figures 3 to 7) could map to there as well.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51">About annotations: in order to explore the annotation functions like those in
                    Figure 2 we made our prototype RDF export mechanism use the OA annotation
                    ontology ([<a class="ref" href="#OA2013">OA 2013</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#sanderson2013">Sanderson et al 2013</a>]), extending
                    and updating some previous work ([<a class="ref" href="#jackson2010">Jackson 2010</a>]) that also
                    explored how to map Pliny data to (the older) OAC ontology. The task was not
                    entirely trivial because <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>'s annotation tools
                    (for, say, images and PDF files) were not designed to model simple annotations
                    in terms of objects such as notes and targets. Instead, <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s underlying model operates in terms of target areas, notes,
                    and links between them all placed in the 2D space. This approach supports the
                    sense of annotation that mirrors annotation on paper, as described earlier, but
                    also enables a richer set of relationships between a collection of notes,
                    targets and connections between them than just notes attached to targets, which
                    is the sense of annotation given in the OA. Our RDF exporter, then, had to take
                    data described in these more general terms and express them as annotations that
                    were conformant with the OA.</div>

                    detail how this mapping was done, but an example will suffice. Figure 8 shows a
                    slightly simplified version of the RDF (turtle notation) generated by our
                    exporter for the annotation called "claiming interdisciplinary" (showing in
                    the top right of Figure 2). This data could be published through a triplestore
                    for public use, although this has not been done at this point in time. As we
                    hope the prefix expansion makes clear in the figure, the <span class="hi italic">jb</span> prefix identifies data that belongs to a particular <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> user, and would be a different prefix for a user

                    resource), and is then assigned attributes that are largely self-explanatory.
                    Fragment "B" contains the RDF for the bit of text that has been applied as

                    personal interpretation for <span class="hi italic">uses of space for study</span> is
                    not an annotation exercise – if it was, what is being annotated? Thus, we cannot
                    use the Open Annotation ontology to model what is going on in Figures 3 to 7.
                    How is this material handled in any translation to RDF?</div>

                    of, to some extent at least, as a graph with typed nodes and links. As mentioned
                    earlier in this paper, this same kind of mathematical graph is the foundation
                    model for RDF [<a class="ref" href="#cyganiak2014">Cyganiak, Wood and Lanthaler 2014</a>, section 3], and it turns out
                    that Pliny's own graph model maps quite comfortably into RDF's "subject predicate object" representation. As a
                    consequence, the RDF exporter we built used a different translation strategy for
                    data from these 2D "concept spaces" than for "annotation spaces". The
                    key was to focus on the relationship between the note and its holder in the 2D
                    space. The <span class="hi italic">Visualisation</span> concept shown in Figure 7 is

                    labelled and identified as concepts with internal Pliny objects. Our RDF
                    extension, however, allowed us to refer instead to URIs that represented the
                    concepts in the global Semantic Web: here we can see several of these concept
                    objects (<cite class="title italic">The Trinity</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Philosophy</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Metaphysics</cite>) are
                    actually references to their corresponding URIs within DBPedia. These
                    links/annotations to Semantic Web URIs that identify these concepts co-exist
                    with other kinds of objects: here we also see commentary in the form of notes,
                    as well as links to other concepts such as the <cite class="title italic">Natural

                    user has not chosen to connect to the Semantic Web as URIs. To make it possible
                    for a user to locate a global URI for concepts like <cite class="title italic">the
                        Trinity</cite>, we developed a rudimentary query mechanism (shown on the
                    top left side of Figure 10) as a prototype tool that allowed the user to query
                    any SPARQL endpoint (here, to <cite class="title italic">DBPedia</cite>) to find URIs
                    within it that had <span class="monospace">rdfs:label</span>s containing a given word – here
                        "Philosophy". Then, having found a suitable URI in the results of the
                    query, the user could simply drag it from the list onto the <cite class="title italic">Vico Frontispiece</cite> image to generate a reference to it. This kind of
                    reference to concepts by referencing a URI on the Semantic Web is, of course,
                    exactly Semantic Annotation of the kind we touched on very briefly earlier in
                    this paper.</div>

                    This can, again, be thought of as annotation, but not in terms of annotating

                    Most of the displayed graph is a representation of the RDF triples that <cite class="title italic">DBPedia</cite> holds and that connect to the central <cite class="title italic">Yalta Conference</cite> URI, and these closely related URIs

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">The reader can probably see by now that 2D space plays a significant role in
                        <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>. First, 2D space has a relatively obvious
                    role in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s annotation support since an
                    annotation <span class="hi italic">target</span> for an image or page of a PDF file is
                    defined by an area on a 2D image or PDF file 2D page. As shown in the example
                    from Figure 8, their position is expressed in RDF through the mechanism that the
                    OA provides for this: the <span class="monospace">oa:fragmentSelector</span> construct (area C).
                    However, there are other objects in Figure 2 to which Pliny also gives a spatial
                    position: the annotation notes themselves. The placement on the page of these
                    annotation notes is not exported at present by our code because its
                        <span class="monospace">oa:Body</span> definition – used to represent the contents of the
                    annotation notes – provides no mechanism for expressing it. Therefore, although
                    of course the spatial layout for these notes could still have been exported as
                    RDF, they could not be presented purely in terms of the OA ontology.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66">Having discussed the place of 2D space in the annotation parts of Pliny, we need
                    also to think about its use elsewhere. The most obvious other use – as a tool to
                    support an emerging interpretation (shown in Figure 3 to 7) – makes 2D space
                    into a central mechanism by which fuzziness and ambiguity is accommodated. It
                    provides an open, flexible, structure for organising materials, and offers some
                    particular affordances, most obviously <span class="hi italic">spatial proximity</span>
                    (but others too: see the discussion in [<a class="ref" href="#bradley2008">Bradley 2008</a>], as a means
                    of expressing unclear relationships between objects. Figure 4 shows the use of
                    spatial proximity in this way most clearly. By putting objects close together
                    the user tentatively suggests some sort of connection between them without
                    needing to pin down too much yet what this connection might be. Although the
                    structuring affordances shown in Figures 5, 6 and 7 add further richness to the
                    data recorded in this space, and reduce the need for 2D's particular expressive
                    characteristics such as spatial proximity, even in the final image (Figure 7) of
                    this sequence the expressive elements provided by 2D space have not been fully
                    eliminated. The layout of the objects there provides a kind of visual
                    enhancement of the presentation of the idea that, say, merely presenting the
                    same associations hierarchically, would not possess.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p67">67</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p67">Think again about the 2D space shown in Figure 4 where the user organised the
                    four images into two groups to reflect a perceived, but yet unclear,
                    relationship between them. If this area was exported into RDF, one would see the
                    references to the four images appearing but there would be no evidence of any
                    possible connection between them, even though the user is consciously using
                    spatial proximity to represent possible connections. The actual placement of the
                    four objects, in terms of their X-Y co-ordinates can certainly be expressed in
                    the RDF. However, even if we added code that would record their placement, the
                    possible connection the user is intending to present by her arrangement is still
                    only at best implicit in the RDF. The tentative connections are presumably
                    evident to the Pliny user (she is deliberatively using the 2D space’s sense of
                    proximity to suggest these possible connections, after all), but this possible
                    connection is not yet formalised in the data structure. In contrast, as soon as
                    containment is brought into the picture to more formally express the
                    relationships (see Figure 5), the relationship between the two sets of objects
                    is also made explicit in the exported RDF.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p68">68</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p68">Does this matter? Does it matter that the user is exploiting the 2D space to
                    express something about the materials without, as it were, telling <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> formally about it? Indeed, does this present a
                    serious challenge to the task we have proposed in this paper: to find a place
                    for "graph thinking" in scholarly interpretation development? We think the
                    issue is not as bad as it might at first appear to be. This is because although,
                    in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>, spatial proximity, with its advantage of
                    vagueness of expression, plays a role in assisting its user during their early
                    thinking about a topic, it seems clear that the process of interpretation around
                    a topic involves a gradual replacing of vague understandings with clearer, more
                    precise, formulations of ideas. Thus, although as we have seen one could argue
                    that the whole idea of spatial proximity (rather than spatial positioning) is to
                    some extent incompatible with standard RDF expressiveness, it is also likely
                    that in fact 2D proximity becomes a less prominent element of expressiveness as
                    the process of developing this concept is carried out in Figures 3-7. Although
                    our RDF exporter does not export spatial position data for concept objects, as
                    the ideas develop further (in the later figures in our <span class="hi italic">uses of
                        space for study</span> example) they become expressed by other means, and
                    these other representations <em class="emph">are</em> already preserved by our RDF
                    exporter. As a concept becomes more mature, it would seem that the spatial
                    information becomes less important as a carrier of information, and the graph
                    representation by itself begins to carry more of the substance of the
                    material.</div>

                    the topic of differences between the expressive possibilities of different media

                    Finally, one issue raised in this paper is the tension between humanities

                        (illustrated by Figures 3 through 7), it would seem that one could reach a
                        level for formalism that begins to connect semantically to conceptions in
                        RDFS [<a class="ref" href="#brickley2014">Brickley and Guha 2014</a>] and even the Owl Ontology language [<a class="ref" href="#OWL2012">OWL 2012</a>]. However, RDFS allows for the expression of more
                        kinds for formal relationships than <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>
                        currently supports, so perhaps one interesting way forward would be to add
                        more of RDFS concepts into <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>. Users can
                        already define new types in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> as a way to
                        express kinds of relationships between objects, and you can see this in
                        operation in Figure 7. Indeed, in our prototype RDF export we interpreted
                        Pliny’s "relationship types" as RDF Properties, and it would be easy to
                        extend Pliny’s rather rudimentary typing model into a hierarchical
                        organisation organised under RDFS’s <span class="monospace">subPredicate</span> concept.
                        Similarly, it would be relatively straightforward to extend Pliny’s
                        note/container model to make them operate as RDFS Classes, including support

                        a scholar/user’s concepts etc., and proposes a third phase (shown in Figure

                        Furthermore, materials from <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> can already
                        be exported in a form that a word processor can use, so a transfer from

                        process is already possible to some limited extent. However, once this is

                        in the humanities, does not necessarily always progress by means of
                        inference and deduction. Martin Mueller’s recent comment in the discussion
                        about CRMInf in Humanist (starting in Humanist 28.812) asking if such an
                        approach "would ever help a literary critic make sense …

                        think raises, albeit obliquely, the same issue. We suspect that Mueller does
                        not believe that CRMInf’s model of formal inference is, in fact, the
                        principal way by which classic humanities scholarship is carried out or
                        expressed. Indeed, theorists like Joris van Zundert [<a class="ref" href="#vanzundert2014">Van Zundert 2014</a>] have argued that there are humanists who
                            "tend to reason abductively" rather than
                        deductively or by inference. If so, a tool to assist these individuals with
                        the preparation of text that was driven by arguments based on formal
                        deduction might be of limited value. </div>

                        very preliminary thinking in this area, to conceive of a new tool for <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> that would be a bit like a word processor,
                        but would also present some visualisation of an argument structure and would
                        also allow a user to preserve links into his/her <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> structure from the article’s text. We are attracted at
                        present to the rather loose conception of how an article’s ideas become
                        organised that was briefly presented in Douglas Engelbart’s famous 1962
                            <cite class="title italic">Augmentation</cite> Report [<a class="ref" href="#engelbart1962">Engelbart 1962</a>, 81–88]. There Engelbart expresses a
                        looser sense of dependence rather than rigorous inference, by observing that
                        any particular idea in an article is often dependent upon one or more ideas
                        that had been presented earlier. Engelbart calls these dependency
                        relationships <span class="hi italic">antecedents</span>, and his approach does
                        resonate with our own experience of writing the article: that part of the
                        task is getting the flow of the text right in ordering things so that for
                        any idea presented its antecedents are also present and presented in
                        advance. Perhaps we might start further work here by exploring Engelbart’s
                        softer-edged "antecedent" approach in addition to
                        CRMInf’s more formal and induction-oriented model.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p79">79</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p79">A third major area of further research that emerges from the ideas in this
                        paper arises when one thinks about whether the publishing of a <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> structure representing aspects of its user’s
                        interpretation can be, in and of itself, considered as a research product.
                        As we mentioned earlier, the idea of publishing, or more informally sharing
                        in some way, some <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> materials is a
                            <em class="emph">little</em> like the idea Gradmann proposes when he talks of
                        publishing "personal digital curation workflows".
                        However, although the characterising of "curation
                            workflows" as the objects being published works well for
                        Gradmann’s Linked-Data and Mashup model, it does not work as well for <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s personal conceptual space context. Our
                        example presented above, the <span class="hi italic">uses of space for study</span>
                        concept, and others one might create in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>,
                        simply <em class="emph">are not</em> a "curation
                            workflows". However, the question still remains about whether
                        materials that are created in <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> are
                        themselves publishable: sharable as data with others in a form that is
                        adequately representative of the ideas they present. The work described here
                        does take us one step in this direction in that, as we have seen, we have
                        done some basic thinking about this when we defined how <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s data could be exported as RDF. However, what issues
                        around making <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> personal data structures
                        public still remain?</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p80">80</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p80">Part of the challenge here relates to what we called earlier the <span class="hi italic">organic</span> nature of <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s data, and the fact that a <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> repository will hold a mix of both unfinished-personal
                        material which is not intended for sharing and mature material that could be
                        made public and sharable with others. Here, the "fruit of the
                            tree" analogy for scholarly research products mentioned
                        earlier is somewhat misleading. Nature packages up mechanisms within the
                        tree’s fruit that, once it is dropped to the ground, allows it to produce a
                        new tree entirely independently of its tree-parent which created it. An
                        apple by itself is sufficient (with soil, sunshine and water) to produce a
                        new apple tree. Thus, although, as the parallel suggests, our
                            "organic" graph might indeed contain areas that could
                        be published as "fruit" for the use of other researchers,
                        the graph model does not impose an independence of these publishable
                        components from other objects in a user’s <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>
                        repository, and in this sense is quite different from the kind of
                        self-contained packaging that the apple represents. Instead, one of Pliny’s
                        concept objects, such as our <span class="hi italic">uses of space for study</span>
                        object, does not stand on its own – it is in fact almost entirely created
                        out of references to <em class="emph">other</em> parts of its creator’s space.
                        Furthermore, as we have indicated above, any user’s <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> repository will contain a mixture of mature material and
                        less polished material. How does one assist the <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> user in managing this issue: making public enough related
                        material so that the exported material can be made sense on its own, and yet
                        excluding personal material that is not ready for public viewing.</div>

                        [<a class="ref" href="#marshall2004">Marshall and Bush 2004</a>]. More recent related work can be seen in [<a class="ref" href="#congleton2009">Congleton et al 2009</a>], where the researchers asked students to mark
                        up maps that would be shared with different kinds of groups, ranging from
                        small groups the students knew to larger groups that they did not. Marshall
                        and Bush’s observation, included in the [<a class="ref" href="#congleton2009">Congleton et al 2009</a>] work,
                        was that when people took what had been a set of personal annotations and
                        decided to make them public they first eliminated most of them, and for the
                        ones to be made public they carried out significant additional work to
                        polish them for publication.</div>

                        materials, RDF’s representation seems to be surprisingly static. There is no
                        sense of timestamping of triples, for example, and no way to attribute
                        triples to individuals who asserted them. Indeed, triples act as
                        second-class objects within RDF with no way to attach attributes of any kind
                        to them. RDF’s "reification" process (see [<a class="ref" href="#nguyen2014">Nguyen, Bodenreider and Sheth 2014</a>] for a discussion) is meant to deal with this
                        issue to some extent, but is, at least as of yet, poorly semantically
                        defined and thus poorly supported by software that supports RDF. This lack
                        of a sense of time in Semantic Web technologies is what provokes a static
                        sense of data in RDF representations. Considering that one would think that

                        contain the conflicting views of many different individuals from around the

                        RDF was simply not meant to deal with time-related issues when it was
                        designed, and it was then expected when RDF was created that more work in

                        contributors and temporal graphs talked about there. [<a class="ref" href="#davis2009">Davis 2009</a>], although now rather dated, also presents some
                        approaches too. [<a class="ref" href="#halpin2014">Halpin and Cheney 2014</a>] explore a provenance model as a
                        basis for modelling the evolution of a data domain on the Semantic Web. Van
                        de Sompel <span class="hi italic">et al</span> explores evolving data in the context
                        of versioning of documents, borrowing ideas from software versioning systems
                        and content management systems such as VCS [<a class="ref" href="#vandesompel2010">Van de Sompel et al 2010</a>, 3]. Although this work does not address all of the issues that
                            <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> data raises it may provide suggestive
                        ideas. Also, work arising out of <span class="hi italic">Pliny</span>, if properly
                        framed, could well constitute further research of interest to computer
                        science on time-evolving data.</div>

                <h1 class="head">Conclusions</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p86">86</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p86">With this paper we hope to start some discussions about aspects of how the
                    Semantic Web might fit with a broad range of research activities as they are
                    practiced in humanities scholarship. Semantic annotation – an approach to
                    information handling that offers some appeal as one way to connect
                    reading-as-scholarship with the structures of the Semantic Web – provides only
                    one perspective on how this scholarship-Semantic Web connection might work. As
                    it turns out, although not originally conceived of in Semantic Web terms, <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite> provides a model for formalising several aspects
                    of traditional scholarship that centre on note-taking and concept development,
                    and which are still largely compatible with RDF data structures: in particular
                    RDF's graph representation. This "graph part" of <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>, by providing a conceptual link with the
                    Semantic Web, allows us to think in a relatively rich way about the possible
                    interactions between actual scholarly practice and the Semantic Web than more
                    Semantic Web driven approaches such as semantic annotation does. Furthermore, we
                    have also explored a little how the process of the emergence of ideas in
                    scholarship is not entirely well served by graph-oriented Semantic Web
                    constructs, and how a different model – two-dimensional space – provides at
                    least one alternative way to think about how to support the process of emergence
                    of ideas. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p87">87</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p87"><cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>'s model, by focusing on supporting the
                        <em class="emph">process</em> of scholarship rather than the representation of its
                    end results, also provides a framework which allows us to engage with the
                    question of how interpretation building, as it might actually be done by
                    scholars, can be better fit with the potential of the Semantic Web. This fitting
                    together must be an important thing to keep in mind if we wish to crack into the
                    mainstream world of scholarship with the Semantic Web – to see how and to what
                    extent scholarship, as it is carried out by most scholars, can be part of "thinking in the graph" as Gradmann put it. Any approach
                    to capture scholarly practice primarily via the highly formalised parts of the
                    Semantic Web through approaches such as semantic annotation does not readily
                    engage with the key work of humanities scholarship: the development of a new
                    personal perspective on a body of material, and – if the idea is persuasive to
                    others – its gradual adoption into the body of shared thinking in a particular
                    humanities discipline. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p88">88</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p88">In fact, we think that <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s model of scholarship
                    support, while revealing aspects of scholarly work that are graph-like and
                    compatible with the Semantic Web, also reveals limitations that are inherent in
                    a graph-based data model. In particular, incompleteness and ambiguity – central
                    facts of life in most scholarship – are handled in Pliny's user interface by the
                    provision of a true 2D working space, and we have suggested in this paper how
                    proximity in 2D space can be used to deal with at least some aspects of
                    incompleteness and ambiguity in a formal digital representation. However, we
                    have also shown that the essence of 2D spatial proximity, as an element of
                    expression by a scholar, does not fit entirely comfortably with RDF and the
                    Semantic Web. Position data can be readily expressed in RDF, but once there it
                    cannot be used by itself to exploit in standard Semantic Web ways the
                    significance of, say, spatial proximity as a relationship between two items.
                    Interestingly, however, <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>’s approach
                        <em class="emph">also</em> suggests that as the ideas become mature and enriched the
                    2D aspect of their representation becomes less significant. Thus, for those
                    mature items apparently not much information is lost when spatial information is
                    ignored. However, for less fully formed items – where 2D proximity is still
                    playing a significant semantic role – this might be more of an issue.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p89">89</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p89"><cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>'s approach, with its particular way to assist
                    a scholar through a process of developing his/her understanding, provides a data
                    model which combines a graph representation (which fits well with current trends
                    in formal structured data in the Semantic Web) with the use of 2D space as an
                    exploratory tool (which provides a mechanism to deal with ambiguity and lack of
                    clarity that is an inevitable result of the process of developing an
                    interpretation of a body of materials, but which fits significantly less well
                    with the Semantic Web). <cite class="title italic">Pliny</cite>, with its attempt to
                    model the scholarly process in the way it does, encourages one to think about
                    how intellectual work in the humanities might better fit with the broad world of
                    open, linked data. In this way, it allows us to think about, as Gradmann
                    suggested [<a class="ref" href="#gradmann2012">Gradmann 2012</a>, slide 22], a "scholarly use of semantic technology" that moves "beyond emulation of Annotation". It also offers us one
                    way to think about how to move the discussion of representing humanities
                    research in terms of the Semantic Web to one that is based upon the
                    epistemological issues that Gradmann claims is "where the
                        issues are located".</div>
