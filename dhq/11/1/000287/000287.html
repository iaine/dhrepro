                <p>This article addresses the relationship of the disciplines of Modern Languages
                    and Digital Humanities in Anglophone academia. It briefly compares and contrasts
                    the nature of these "disciplines" – most frequently conceived
                    of as either inter- or transdisciplines – before going on to examine in some
                    detail the participation of Modern Linguists in Digital Humanities and that of
                    Digital Humanists in Modern Languages. It argues that, while there is growing
                    evidence of work that crosses "disciplinary" boundaries
                    between DH and ML in both directions, more work of this sort needs to be done to
                    optimise the potential of both disciplines. It also makes a particular case for
                    Digital Humanities to remain open to critical cultural studies approaches to
                    digital materials as pertaining to the discipline rather than focusing
                    exclusively on more instrumental definitions of Digital Humanities. This
                    argument is consistent with the concerns raised by other scholars with regard to
                    the need for heterogeneity of approach and in particular for increased cultural
                    criticism in Digital Humanities scholarship. Furthermore, we argue that this is
                    where Modern Linguists can make their most decisive contribution to Digital
                    Humanities research, offering what we term a "critical DHML" approach. We
                    illustrate our arguments with a range of examples from the intersection of ML
                    and DH in the broad field of Hispanic Studies, including the major findings of
                    our own research into digital cultural production in a Latin American context
                    conducted over the last ten years.</p>

                        with the mainstream humanities or, even more strikingly, with "new media studies" (populated as the latter is by
                        net critics, tactical media critics, hacktivists, and so on). We digital
                        humanists develop tools, data, metadata, and archives critically; and we
                        have also developed critical positions on the nature of such resources […].

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The decision of <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> to start publishing a series of
                    special issues focusing on Digital Humanities "in different
                        languages or regional traditions" is a very welcome development. As
                    Hispanists who have worked for the last decade on critical digital culture/new
                    media studies in a Latin American context this is an initiative that we very
                    much wanted to engage with, and we took as our inspiration the special issue
                    dedicated to Digital Humanities work "in Spanish".
                    What we address in this article are issues that arose from this initial
                    inspiration but which, however, expand from this to ask questions about what
                    Digital Humanities really is, and what its relationship to Modern Languages (ML)
                    might be; and a converse set of questions about what is happening in Modern
                    Languages and how greater engagement with Digital Humanities is undoubtedly
                    necessary. Our argument is therefore not focused so much on a dialogue with
                    other DH practitioners working in Spanish-language contexts, but on a dialogue
                    with the disciplines – most frequently conceived of as either inter- or
                    transdisciplines – of Digital Humanities and Modern Languages in an Anglophone
                    academic context.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">We are mindful of the fact that scholars working in Anglophone Digital Humanities
                    institutional contexts are currently very open to, and encouraging, of DH
                    initiatives in other languages and contexts and are keen to foster the "global DH" that Isabel Galina Russell (cited above) has
                    called for (of this, more later). However, we would like to argue that what
                    scholars working within Modern Languages institutional frameworks in Anglophone
                    academia can contribute are a much more diverse range of projects and materials
                    conducted in languages other than English and that may or may not self-identify
                    as pertaining to "Digital Humanities". (Indeed, such
                    materials and the way in which ML scholars approach them are typically more
                    readily embraced by media and communications studies via denominations such as
                    new media studies, internet studies, or digital cultural studies than they are
                    by Digital Humanities.) Related to this expansion of projects and materials,
                    Modern Linguists also tend to approach their materials through the application
                    of the still very useful methodologies of the critical cultural studies scholar.
                    Such methodologies are of course not altogether lacking in DH, but critics such
                    as Liu and McPherson (cited above) have called for a deeper and more sustained
                    cultural criticism to be developed within DH, and this is one way that Modern
                    Linguists can help shape Digital Humanities as it develops.<a class="noteRef" href="#d1297e248">[1]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">In this article we therefore propose that the heterogeneity that Galina Russell
                    argues should be allowed to flourish in an ideal "global
                        DH" also has to extend, as some have already argued, to heterogeneity
                    of approach within Digital Humanities itself, so that cultural criticism of
                    digital products and close textual analysis is accorded a more significant role.
                    Furthermore, we concur with Galina Russell that it is time for all the various
                    and different versions of DH to compare and contrast their situatedness
                    globally, hopefully eschewing the construction of any sense of centre/periphery
                    or "one true DH" as the exercise unfolds. And moreover, as DH
                    embeds itself within academia across the globe, it is also time to be alert to
                    the dangers of institutionalisation – of "Balkanisation" – so
                    that this new (inter/trans)discipline does not lose the ability to speak in the
                    vernacular of the humanities, instead keeping alive the "common
                        languages" that allow it to dialogue with earlier
                    (inter/trans)disciplinary frameworks such as ML.<a class="noteRef" href="#d1297e268">[2]</a> We propose that a name for one such a common
                    language might just be "critical DHML".</div>

                    supportive "humanities computing" in the 1980s, through the adoption of the

                    Digital Humanists. Part of this latter phase of DH’s development have been the
                    illuminating and ongoing debates about its nature and shape, with debates on DH

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Digital Humanities is most often conceived of as an
                        "interdiscipline" welding together computing and the
                    traditional humanities. With respect to the complex interdisciplinary nature of
                    DH, Julie Thompson Klein gives a very detailed account of this issue in her
                        <cite class="title italic">Interdisciplining Digital Humanities: Boundary Work in
                        an Emerging Field</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="#ThompsonKlein2015">Thompson Klein 2015</a>]. Of particular interest, is her discussion of
                    two different types of interdisciplinarity at work in DH:
                    instrumental/strategic/opportunistic interdisciplinarity which seeks to foster
                    discourse between disciplines to "create a product"
                    or "meet a designated pragmatic need", as opposed to
                    critical or reflexive interdisciplinarity which "interrogates the dominant structure of knowledge and
                            education with the aim of transforming them"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#ThompsonKlein2015">Thompson Klein 2015</a>, 18]. Arguably, it is the latter form of interdisciplinarity that we, as ML
                    scholars, see as most clearly aligned with our own objectives.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Furthermore, we note that DH scholars have deliberately and productively sought
                    to leave the definition of DH as open as possible, with the editorial "welcome" in the first issue of <cite class="title italic">DHQ</cite> not stipulating the boundaries of DH, but rather inviting it to
                    be defined by its contributors [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2007">Flanders et al. 2007</a>, para. 5].
                    Others such as Alvarado have urged, in confessional mode, "Let’s be honest — there is no definition of Digital
                            Humanities, if by definition we mean a consistent set of theoretical
                            concerns and research methods that might be aligned with a given
                            discipline, whether one of the established fields or an emerging,
                            transdisciplinary one"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#alvarado2012">Alvarado 2012</a>, 50]. This gesture towards transdisciplinarity, or disciplinary openness aimed
                    at addressing complex research questions that do not sit neatly within any
                    traditional discipline, is something that we welcome, and that offers rich
                    possibilities for cross-fertilisations with ML, as with a range of other
                    disciplines. Thompson Klein conceives of transdisciplinarity as a framework
                    which evidences similar critical potential to critical/reflexive
                    interdisciplinarity and she makes clear the relationship of a transdisciplinary
                    DH to some of the other fields of critical enquiry that are the basis of much ML

                    recognised that as DH takes shape, inevitably certain practices emerge and come

                    editors noted earlier in their editorial that, <blockquote><p>

                            theory and practice, technological implementation and scholarly

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Thus, as has been recognised widely by the DH scholarly community, even if rigid
                    definitions of DH are theoretically avoided, the academic practice that goes on
                    beneath the DH rubric creates a kind of common-law definition that quickly
                    acknowledges "orthodoxies" and "intellectual paths of least resistance". If these orthodoxies are
                    starting to take shape, we now look at DH scholars who have recently outlined
                    the modus operandi of DH to see how ML might contribute to these debates and
                    position itself in fruitful dialogue with DH.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">Kathleen Fitzpatrick’s work has been at the forefront of debates on DH’s shape
                    and its future direction, and her observations provide a particularly useful
                    delineation of the discipline, and, in our view, of where ML can fit.
                    Fitzpatrick argues that DH has two concurrent but quite different modus
                    operandi: one that "bring[s] the tools and techniques of
                        digital media to bear on traditional humanistic questions" and
                    another that "bring[s] humanistic modes of inquiry to bear
                        on digital media"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#lopez2015">Lopez et al. 2015</a>]. She notes elsewhere that such differences of
                    approach "often produce significant tension"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#fitzpatrick2012">Fitzpatrick 2012</a>, 13–14], such that, for many "hard core" and quite pragmatic
                    Digital Humanists the second approach is separated off from DH to form a
                        "cousin discipline" that goes by the name of critical
                    cybercultural studies, internet studies or new media studies. Nevertheless,
                    Fitzpatrick goes on to make a plea for retaining the plurality of approach that
                    DH theoretically embraces: <blockquote><p>
                        The particular contribution of the Digital Humanities,
                            however, lies in its exploration of the difference that the digital can
                            make to the kinds of work that we do as well as to the ways that we
                            communicate with one another. These new modes of scholarship and
                            communication will best flourish if they, like the Digital Humanities,
                            are allowed to remain plural.

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">It is certainly true that the former of the two ways identified by Fitzpatrick
                    has seen exponential growth in recent years. From the preservation and archiving
                    of manuscripts via digital means to data mining methodologies for large corpora
                    of humanities materials, our broad field of the humanities has seen sweeping
                    changes to its practice, with digital tools enabling humanities research to
                    achieve a breadth and arguably also a depth never before seen. Robust models
                    have been put forward for DH as regards this first path, and new tools and
                    methodologies are constantly under development.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">It is arguably the second of these two paths – the "bringing
                        humanistic modes of inquiry to bear on digital media" – that has been
                    under-theorised and under-represented in debates on the nature and shape of
                    Digital Humanities. This is not to say that the scholarship is not taking place
                    – a significant amount of work on digital cultural production is taking place
                    across a variety of disciplines –; rather, the issue is that this scholarship,
                    and the debates arising from it, do not always find their way into discussions
                    of DH. There are multiple factors that have led to this, including the
                    pragmatics of a field that is large and unwieldy, and also the fact that
                    scholars of digital cultural production might not necessarily self-identify as
                    Digital Humanists, and their publication outlets, conferences, and arenas for
                    debate may not coincide with those preferred by Digital Humanists.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">If Fitzpatrick set out a neat binary division in the modus operandi of DH, in an
                    alternative but complementary conceptualisation of what DH is, David Berry
                    conceives of it as a series of waves of development, arguing that <blockquote><p>
                        first-wave Digital Humanities involved the building of
                            infrastructure in the studying of humanities texts through digital
                            repositories, text markup and so forth, whereas second-wave Digital
                            Humanities expands the notional limits of the archive to include digital
                            works, and so bring to bear the humanities’ own methodological toolkits
                            to look at "born-digital" materials, such as electronic literature
                            (e-lit), interactive fiction (IF), web-based artefacts and so
                            forth.
                         [<a class="ref" href="#berry2012">Berry 2012</a>, 4]
                    </p></blockquote> While these two waves synchronise with Fitzpatrick’s discussion of the
                    different modes of DH scholarship, Berry then goes on to argue that third-wave
                    Digital Humanities would constitute cases where as much attention is paid to
                    what difference the digital makes in the study of digital cultural production as
                    it is to the cultural aspects of the production itself. In other words, this
                    would involve supplementing "the humanities’ own
                        methodological toolkits" with theoretical insights from software,
                    critical code and platform studies. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">This is a point that is best exemplified in some of Tara McPherson’s work where
                    she argues that we need to understand computer programming in order to perceive
                    the politics embedded in its development, and thus be able to critique the
                    resultant technologies for the ways in which they replicate those political
                    agendas. More specifically, McPherson argues that we need to grasp the way that
                    programming languages have typically been based on modularity and "lenticular logics"<a class="noteRef" href="#d1297e460">[4]</a> which curb
                    relationality and "privilege[…] fragmentation"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#McPherson2012">McPherson 2012</a>, 144], and that those same concepts also underpin the "covert racial logic" of the post-civil rights era in the USA and
                    account for the limitations of 1960s identity politics, such that the
                    architecture of contemporary computing is, from its very base, predestined to
                    best represent a particular, hegemonic worldview. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">Furthermore, Berry also argues that third-wave Digital Humanities researchers
                    should endeavour to challenge unhelpful disciplinary boundaries, as well as
                    problematise "the 'hard-core' of the humanities,
                            the unspoken assumptions and ontological foundations which support the
                                'normal' research that humanities scholars
                            undertake on an everyday basis"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#berry2012">Berry 2012</a>, 4]. This endeavour to challenge disciplinary boundaries is one which, as we
                    argue in this article, is pertinent to all of us, ML included. We would also
                    suggest that the particular "hard-core" of the humanities
                    that might be fruitfully challenged in ML would include national or area studies
                    paradigms that still structure our departments and research projects but that
                    need to be problematised in order to ensure that our research is capable of
                    analysing materials that exist beyond such paradigms, and that our teaching
                    remains relevant in a globalising Higher Education sector. In summary, this
                    third-wave Digital Humanities that is as critical of the digital as it is of the
                    cultural, and which is open to tearing down disciplinary boundaries as well as
                    internal orthodoxies where necessary, is essentially the basis for what Berry
                    and others now term a "critical" Digital

                    For, just as DH has been attempting to define itself, so too, ML has faced the
                    need to examine its own practice. In particular, a challenge for ML has been
                    taking up the gauntlet of the Worton report, which charged it very prominently
                    with the task of promoting a "clear and compelling identity for Modern Languages as a

                    be found in the work of many individual ML scholars to boot – has been a
                    constant problem. ML has always had to grapple with this tension: on the one
                    hand, the specificity of ML-qua-discipline, and the need to articulate what ML
                    scholars have in common and that makes our research distinctive in comparison
                    with that conducted by scholars working in other disciplinary contexts; and on
                    the other, the fact that ML is, in effect, a multiplicity of disciplines (ML
                    scholars are, variously, historians, literary scholars, film studies scholars,
                    sociolinguists, and so forth). Indeed, indicative of this understanding of ML as
                    constituting a multiplicity of disciplines is the key change in our draft
                    subject benchmark statements in 2015 which moved from identifying the
                        "discipline" as "modern language studies" (as it appeared in the
                    previous 2007 statements) to identifying it as "languages,
                        cultures and societies", precisely in order to clarify the range of
                    humanities disciplines across which we work [<a class="ref" href="#qaa">QAA 2015</a>]. ML has thus
                    been faced with the challenge of what Charles Forsdick has called "prevent[ing] the interdisciplinary from becoming the

                    the very recent consolidation of Digital Humanities as a discipline with
                    departments, centres, journals, and so on, the use of digital technologies at
                    all stages of the DH research process often led to the circumvention of the
                    traditional circuits of cultural capital, providing greater flexibility, but a
                    research field that was more diffuse, multiple and ephemeral.<a class="noteRef" href="#d1297e627">[8]</a> And
                    perhaps because both Modern Languages and Digital Humanities share similar
                    issues with disciplinarity, and therefore with "readability"
                    – and this despite the general belief that both ML and DH are all about dialogue
                    and translation across (disciplinary and/or linguistic) boundaries –, this
                    should encourage us all in both ML and DH to strive to develop common languages
                    between us, to keep the doors open to dialogue even if we all also need to
                    strive to articulate coherent disciplinary identities for more pragmatic,
                    institutional purposes. Furthermore, this has to be seen as a two-way dialogue:
                    on the one hand, ML can benefit enormously from the insights of DH, which have
                    shown us new ways of working and thinking; on the other, as we argue below, DH
                    can also benefit from ML’s interventions in its debates. </div>

                    engagement with Digital Humanities, digital technologies have, in a variety of
                    ways, changed the way in which we research as ML scholars, across the whole
                    cycle of the research process, from textual preservation, through analysis, to
                    archiving and dissemination. Medieval manuscript scholarship was one of the
                    first areas within ML to embrace DH, with examples such as the University of
                    Wisconsin-Madison <cite class="title italic">Dictionary of the Old Spanish
                        Language</cite> project that started in the 1970s and developed its own
                    tagging system [<a class="ref" href="#nitti1979">Nitti 1979</a>]. Building on this early initiative,
                    the Liverpool <cite class="title italic">Cancionero</cite> project began in the
                    mid-1980s, using Madison tagging norms, and led to the <cite class="title italic">Electronic Corpus of 15<span class="hi superscript">th</span>-Century Castilian
                        Cancionero Manuscripts</cite>, which included codicological MS
                    descriptions, digitised MS images and digital transcriptions of the corpus.
                    These two projects, pioneering in the field, led the way not only in making use
                    of digital technologies to bring together a dispersed corpus for the first time,
                    but also in developing tagging systems for medieval manuscripts that have
                    changed the way that scholars access such texts.</div>

                    ML scholarship has integrated DH tools in the analysis of manuscripts, and,
                    essentially, mobilised DH in relation to already existing (pre-digital) sources,
                    other projects have used DH tools and methodologies in the creation of their
                    corpora. Such is the case, for instance, of the HERA-funded collaborative <cite class="title italic">Travelling Texts, 1790-1914</cite> project which undertakes
                    systematic scrutiny of reception data from large-scale sources (library and
                    booksellers’ catalogues, the periodical press), and thus uses DH approaches in
                    the creation of its data. In a similar vein, Kirsty Hooper’s digital history
                    projects, such as her <cite class="title italic">Hispanic Liverpool</cite> database
                    of nineteenth-century Liverpool residents who were born in the Hispanic world,
                    or her <cite class="title italic">Atlantis Project: Women and Words in Spain,
                        1890-1936</cite>, involving a database of bio-bibliographic information
                    about women writers in Spain, make use of databases to explore "what the details of forgotten lives can tell us about wider
                        questions in cultural history". In these and other projects, the
                    advent of what are loosely termed "big data" approaches have had a
                    significant impact on how ML scholarship conceives of itself.<a class="noteRef" href="#d1297e678">[9]</a>

                    corpus of all time periods and geographical regions in which Spanish has been

                    have had a significant impact on the way in which ML scholars approach corpora.
                    Scholars such as Mark Davies have demonstrated how these large-scale databases
                    provide an "entirely new perspective on what can be done with

                         [<a class="ref" href="#davies2010">Davies 2010</a>, 142], allowing for a wide range of queries and the searching of topics in an
                    in-depth way that was not possible previously. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">Yet archiving pre-digital corpora or creating new corpora from disparate
                    pre-digital materials, and the "big data" approaches that
                    such corpora facilitate, are not the only achievements of Modern Linguists
                    working with Digital Humanities approaches. Digital Humanities approaches in ML
                    also extend to the generation of new analytical methods, as seen, for example,
                    in the work of Hispanist and film studies scholar Catherine Grant who has
                    developed highly innovative video essays on films, both celluloid and digital.
                    These video essays are not just a way for Grant to disseminate her work in
                    public fora – via her <cite class="title italic">Film Studies for Free</cite> or
                    (co-edited) <cite class="title italic">Mediático</cite> blogs – but constitute a new
                    form of methodological approach in itself which allows her to view films
                    differently, for example allowing her to analyse excerpts of a film and its
                    remake simultaneously and thus discover things that older, less accurately
                    synchronic methods of comparative analysis arguably could not have revealed. The
                    innovation in Grant’s work, then, is her conception of digital interventions as
                    not purely instrumental tools, but as creative outlets that combine both
                    research and object of study. This innovative methodological development, and
                    others like it, has not yet been fully embraced by DH – Grant’s work, for
                    instance, has not yet been taken up by any DH companion or compendium –, but
                    arguably there is a fruitful conversation to be had about new digital analytical
                    and methodological approaches resulting from it.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">All of these – and many others besides – are examples of how ML has benefitted
                    from DH tools and methodologies, and how ML in its various forms has engaged
                    with DH approaches. The bigger projects for corpora in particular are also
                    indicators of the growing ways in which these and other ML projects have had to
                    conceive of themselves as collaborative, involving computer scientists as much
                    as linguists, and requiring a re-thinking of the "lone
                        scholar" model. In this regard, DH is one of the drivers within a
                    general paradigm shift that has seen humanities scholarship more broadly move
                    away from this "lone scholar" model, motivated by a
                    generalised understanding that there is a need for more inter- and
                    transdisciplinarity, as we seek to answer bigger, more complex questions.
                    Digital Humanities tools and methods have, thus, contributed to the growing ways
                    in which we as ML scholars have re-evaluated our practice as researchers, and
                    have enriched our research field.</div>

                    existing manuscripts, records or corpora and how they may best be mobilised
                    through the digital, an emerging field has also been that of the digital as
                    object of study in ML. Profound and significant changes to our objects of study
                    have been wrought by digital creators and users living in other parts of the
                    globe, and working in a variety of languages. The large and vibrant communities
                    of digital practice in non-Anglophone contexts – from net artists and authors of
                    electronic literature, through to hacktivists and tactical media practitioners –
                    have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the ways in which
                    we think about and use digital technologies today. Here, ML’s findings as
                    regards digital content creation in various locales and communities around the
                    globe can provide insights that would enrich DH, and contribute to its ongoing

                    Digitales Hispánicas (HDH) in Spain and the Red de Humanistas Digitales (RedDH)
                    in Mexico are good examples of the growth of a self-identifying Hispanic DH. The
                    Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) DH2015 conference, which was
                    held in Sydney, Australia, included papers in French, German, Italian and

                    City in 2018. At the same time, there has been an active debate on DH discussion
                    lists about how heavily Anglophone a purportedly "global" DH
                    really is, with Hispanic DH scholars fighting back. Galina Russell’s recent
                    article [<a class="ref" href="#galina2014">Galina Russell 2014</a>] provides an illuminating overview of these
                    debates within the DH community as it grapples with issues of geographical and
                    linguistic diversity, and summarises recent developments that have attempted to
                    create a more global DH community.</div>

                    in DH, ML can make important contributions as regards critical analysis of the

                    process have already been taken, with pioneering scholars such as Paul Spence
                    who have aimed to bring digital critical cultural studies into the DH fold. A

                        humanidades digitales verdaderamente globales" (to create a truly
                    global digital humanities)<a class="noteRef" href="#d1297e777">[10]</a>
                    [<a class="ref" href="#spence2014a">Spence 2014</a>, 52], and within the same article, argued for
                    bringing scholars such as comparative literature theorist Laura Borràs – and the
                    critical cultural studies that she represents – into the domain of DH.<a class="noteRef" href="#d1297e782">[11]</a> This impetus from Spence is one that we pick up on in this
                    article: we argue that one way of achieving this truly global DH is to bring the
                    critical cultural studies of ML into the DH fold, and we detail here what the
                    advantages of such a manoeuvre might be.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p27">27</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p27">One particular way in which an ML-inflected approach to DH can be constructive is
                    in the study of (digital) objects. All too frequently, digital technologies,
                    their applications and their analyses have been developed in a predominantly
                    Anglophone environment. Notwithstanding some landmark volumes which have aimed
                    to contest Anglophone models, such as <cite class="title italic">Internationalizing

                    [<a class="ref" href="#maaya">Maaya Network 2012</a>], it still remains the case that digital culture theory is
                    dominated by the Anglophone. What ML can provide is a pluricultural and
                    plurilingual understanding of digital culture, an attention to cultural and
                    linguistic specificity, and even a questioning of some of the predominantly
                    Anglophone assumptions underpinning many of the purported

                    noted above, attention to digital cultural production remains relatively
                    underdeveloped within DH, but is, nevertheless, a key component of DH’s
                    development, then our work in this area can help to strengthen DH’s profile
                    overall. Furthermore, the cultural and linguistic insights that ML can
                    contribute are key to ensuring that DH’s approach to global digital culture is
                    as well informed and contextualised as possible. As we illustrate below, ML
                    approaches can help develop new insights into how these cultural forms are
                    negotiated by users crossing languages and cultures; we can offer relational and
                    situated approaches; and we can demonstrate how plurilingual and pluricultural

                    that have transformed our understanding of what a "text" is. It would offer
                    an analysis of new cultural forms being developed at the interface between
                    literary-cultural expression and new media technologies, exploring the
                    transformations in conventional understandings of genres and cultural-artistic
                    codes stimulated by the advent of digital technologies. And most importantly, it
                    would explore how these new digital genres – as varied as hypermedia fiction or
                    game art – do not build exclusively upon an Anglophone heritage, but respond to
                    and continue a rich tradition of cultural, literary and artistic experimentation
                    undertaken by writers, artists and thinkers working in many different languages

                    closely with research that explores to what extent these new digital cultural
                    forms foster greater interaction and afford greater agency to the user, and what
                    the implications of this might be when users cross languages and cultures. Here,

                    practical bases of Modern Languages research are having to adapt to the
                    challenges of the digital. Key to the Writing Sprint was the bringing together
                    of scholars working both in Modern Languages and in Digital Humanities
                    institutional contexts, and with expertise across the whole range of the

                    Writing Sprint thus aimed to open up these dialogues from tools to objects of
                    study, and one of its main findings was the need for us to be working
                    collaboratively – across institutions, across disciplines, and across languages
                    – and that an in-depth and critical engagement with the digital is central to

                    Latin American cultural producers as often choosing to strategically resist new
                    technologies, albeit while simultaneously using them, and that they had reason
                    to do this because of their non-conformity with the neo-colonialist rhetoric
                    underpinning most Anglophone discourse concerning
                        "cyberspace" (qua "new frontier"), and
                    that they even made claims for the need for "new architectures of language"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#Martín-Barbero2000">Martín-Barbero 2000</a>, 69] that went as structurally deep as code. As Raúl Trejo Delabre has argued:
                        "the formats for making and organising websites have
                        been determined by technology and subsequently by the customs of the biggest
                        community of Netusers in the world; i.e. the citizens of the United
                        States", and thus "there is no Latin American <em class="emph">language</em> in
                            which to express our specific content in that global hall of mirrors
                            that is the Internet"

                    that it is impossible for most to speak in anything but "the master’s
                        tongue", it is probably too late for Latin Americans, or indeed
                    any of us, to develop a form of programming that overcomes modularity and
                    lenticularity [see [<a class="ref" href="#McPherson2012">McPherson 2012</a>]] – not even open source
                    software can really offer such a radical revision of the paradigms of
                    computational culture, it seems. However, it also became apparent through our
                    work on this collection, how Latin American writers, for example, might attempt
                    to resist, however ironically, the modularity that underpins the functioning of
                    hypertext [see [<a class="ref" href="#pitman2007">Pitman 2007</a>]]. In this way our collection sought
                    to offer a postcolonialist critique of the presence and use of the internet and
                    associated technologies in the region and one that tried to dig deeper than a
                    superficial critique of representation on computer screens. Furthermore, if we
                    read "Latin Americans" as "raza",<a class="noteRef" href="#d1297e942">[15]</a> or at the very least as a
                    differently situated (and very large) group of people to "white" US
                    citizens, this collection provides copious examples of academic work in the
                    broad field of Digital Humanities that does not focus on "white" subjects,
                    and some that explicitly focuses on the role that race, as well as gender and
                    other identitarian vectors, plays in such cultural production. In this way we
                    can be seen as having made an early contribution to the recently emerged fields
                    of critical/postcolonial Digital Humanities.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">In our 2012 book, <cite class="title italic">Latin American Identity in Online Cultural
                        Production</cite>, we set forth an important confrontation of Latin
                    American cultural studies and digital culture studies, and proposed a
                    theorisation of a post-regional approach to Latin American (digital) cultural
                    studies. Our volume brought into dialogue two disciplinary fields – namely,
                    internet studies and Latin Americanism – and, working in negotiation between
                    these two disciplines, we proposed an innovative theoretical model for
                    understanding how the defining discourses of Latin America are reconfigured
                    online. Our contention in this publication was that Latin American digital
                    culture, and the theoretical and analytical models we proposed for it, engage
                    with some of the central issues that are at the heart of both internet studies
                    and Latin Americanism today. The questioning of the project of area studies, and
                    of Latin American studies as one such area within that, has been widely debated
                    since the 1990s, and represents a potential troubling of the very foundations on
                    which, ostensibly, we Latin Americanists base our research, demanding a
                    re-assessment of what it means to engage in Latin American studies in our
                    contemporary, globalised world. However, we went on to argue that to talk of
                    Latin American online cultural practice is not an outright paradox, but rather
                    emblematic of new forms of rather more deterritorialised Latin Americanism which
                    take into account the problematisation of area studies. Indeed, we argued that
                    it is at the intersection of these two developments – on the one hand, a rise in
                    scholarly debates on Latin American (popular) culture and new media, and, on the
                    other hand, the deconstruction of the term "Latin America" itself – that
                    the study of Latin American online cultural production lies. This, then, was our
                    contribution to challenging through internet studies a key aspect of "the 'hard-core' of the humanities"
                    that Berry hoped critical/third-wave Digital Humanities would address.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">In a more recent publication, our research has explored the need to re-think some
                    of the assumptions around globalising digital technologies when looking from a
                    ML perspective. Taylor’s 2013 volume engaged with one of the most topical issues
                    in discussions about the internet in recent years: the extent to which online
                    content can be understood as rooted in a particular place. Taylor’s book
                    explored this issue taking as examples a vibrant community of Latin(o) American
                    artists to investigate how, in their online works, they engage in re-imaginings
                    and representations of offline place. Building on and dialoguing with recent
                    debates on tactical media, as well as upon the rich Latin(o) American-specific
                    heritage of the resistant appropriation of hegemonic tools in a broader sense,
                    the book demonstrated how networked digital media offers the possibilities of
                    rethinking place and territory, and how Latin(o) American net artists make
                    creative use of this possibility. The book’s two overarching questions –
                    firstly, the role that digital technologies play in allowing for the formulation
                    of place-based affiliations, and secondly, how alternative modes of expression
                    and dissemination enabled by digital technologies may be appropriated to give
                    voice to oppositional or resistant discourses – are, we argue, of particular
                    relevance to DH today. The book’s potential contributions to DH therefore
                    include an awareness of the rootedness and of the (cultural, linguistic, ethnic)
                    specificity of how, where, and why digital technologies are used, coupled with
                    an understanding of how these digital technologies are used to express profound
                    social, political and ethical concerns.</div>

                    more of us working in these two disciplines ought to seek to achieve fluency.
                    The development of this kind of common language may also prove to be an
                    important factor in helping to avoid disciplinary
                        "Balkanisation" as DH settles into traditional
                    institutional structures. For as long as scholars of both Digital Humanities and
                    Modern Languages continue to be able to conceive of themselves as promoting a
                        "critical" or "reflexive", rather than
                    instrumental, strategic or opportunistic, kind of interdisciplinarity, and/or a
                    transdisciplinarity that is transgressive, critical and genuinely open to other
                    perspectives, to borrow Thompson Klein’s terms cited earlier, then at an
                    epistemological level, they will be capable of working together and speaking the
                    same language. On a more pragmatic level, they will need both a political
                    climate, within and beyond Higher Education – a climate that, for example, does
                    not seek to manage the dialogue between disciplines as one might a business
                    enterprise –, and the kinds of resources – most importantly, time – that are
                    conducive to creative, speculative engagement with other points of view that
                    may, or may not always, bear fruit. </div>

                    The current shifts in the UK research environment, with the increasing need to
                    work collaboratively, and to address global challenges that cannot be solely
                    answered by any one discipline or methodology, offer fruitful opportunities for
                    the development of our shared language. The continuing development of the
                    synergies between ML and DH, and of thematic working that cuts across
                    disciplines and methods, can help situate both ML and DH at the forefront of
                    approaches to these global challenges. </div>

<div id="notes"><h2>Notes</h2><div class="endnote" id="d1297e248"><span class="noteRef">[1]</span> To be clear,
                        Modern Languages is not the only other discipline with which DH should enter
                        into dialogue, nor do we seek to claim that it is, absolutely, "the
                            most relevant" discipline for DH. Nevertheless, as academics
                        situated within Modern Languages institutional frameworks, we are most
                        interested in exploring areas where we think ML can help expand the
                        objectives of DH and where DH can help ML expand its own disciplinary
                        horizons.</div><div class="endnote" id="d1297e268"><span class="noteRef">[2]</span> While DH and ML share an
                        epistemological basis in inter- and/or transdisciplinarity, and some of our
                        argument relies on comparisons and suggestions made on this basis, we also
                        seek to move beyond considerations about the nature of disciplinarity and
                        disciplinary change <span class="foreign i">per se</span> in order to
                        place the emphasis more firmly on the relationship between DH and ML in its
                        particularity. The study of disciplinarity, even with specific reference to
                        DH, is already extensive and we will refer to this as necessary to advance
                        our arguments. For now, it is worth mentioning that research in DH and ML
                        can be either interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary and we will henceforth
                        use this terminology selectively, depending on the argument being advanced.
                        Where we do not wish to advance an argument based specifically on the
                        distinction between inter- and transdisciplinarity, we will refer to them
                        simply as disciplines. We would also note that quite often terms such as
                        interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity are used almost interchangeably
                        in the work of otherwise very accomplished critics, thus complicating any
                        easy definitions.</div><div class="endnote" id="d1297e306"><span class="noteRef">[3]</span> We are mindful of the fast pace at which new
                        volumes and/or expanded editions of volumes about DH are being published.
                        While the volumes noted here were some of most significant at the time we
                        started to write this article, we will consider newer volumes and expanded

                        [<a class="ref" href="#svensson2015">Svensson and Goldberg 2015</a>], the editors do much to expand the
                        disciplinary horizons of DH, reaching out to the often overlooked
                        disciplines of religious studies/theology and archaeology, for example. It
                        is also pleasing to see the development of Postcolonial DH over the past

                        debate about ML as inherently interdisciplinary and as offering
                        transdisciplinary approaches takes place against a backdrop of growing
                        suspicion about disciplinary boundaries; see, for instance, Sandra Harding’s
                        reminder of the constructed, situated nature of all knowledge, and her
                        critique of authoritarian moves to police the boundaries of disciplines
                        and/or suggest that in and of themselves they can offer a "theory of everything"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#harding2015">Harding 2015</a>, 122]. Her appeal for a "disunited" and "heterogeneous" approach to the construction of
                        forms of knowledge is kith and kin with transdisciplinary dialogue and

                        by the Hadron Collider) that exceed our capabilities to deal with it, "big
                            data" approaches are also being developed within the humanities.
                        Although big data definitions in the humanities are still being agreed upon,
                        we draw on Andrew Prescott’s reflections on big data in the humanities as
                        involving projects when data is on such a scale that the "tried and

                        this, mean to suggest that big data approaches are necessarily entirely
                        novel, or that they necessitate the overthrowing of all our conventional
                        humanities methodologies. Rather, we take on board Prescott’s reminder that
                        one can argue that big data goes back to classical antiquity [quoted in [<a class="ref" href="#messner2015">Messner 2015</a>]]; and Hitchcock’s exhortations that, in the rush
                        towards big data approaches, we must not forget the "small data"
