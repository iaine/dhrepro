                <p>We investigate what distinguishes reported dreams from other personal narratives.
                    The <em class="term">continuity hypothesis</em>, stemming from psychological dream
                    analysis work, states that most dreams refer to a person’s daily life and
                    personal concerns, similar to other personal narratives such as diary entries.
                    Differences between the two texts may reveal the linguistic markers of dream
                    text, which could be the basis for new dream analysis work and for the automatic
                    detection of dream descriptions. We used three text analytics methods: text
                    classification, topic modeling, and text coherence analysis, and applied these
                    methods to a balanced set of texts representing dreams, diary entries, and other
                    personal stories. We observed that dream texts could be distinguished from other
                    personal narratives nearly perfectly, mostly based on the presence of
                    uncertainty markers and descriptions of scenes. Important markers for non-dream
                    narratives are specific time expressions. Dream texts also exhibit a lower
                    discourse coherence than other personal narratives.</p>

                <h1 class="head">1. Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Dreams are a fascinating phenomenon that has been studied for millennia. In
                    ancient Greek and Egyptian times dreams were seen as messages from the gods, and
                    played an important role in religion. One of the earliest recorded dream
                    analyses was written on clay tablets in Mesopotamia, 5000 years ago [<a class="ref" href="#black1992">Black and Green 1992</a>]. This ancient epic tale of Gilgamesh includes several
                    dream descriptions and interpretations. Nowadays, various research fields still
                    study the meaning and purpose of dreams, such as psychiatry, psychology,
                    neuroscience, and religious studies. Despite all these research efforts, a
                    comprehensive explanation of the purpose of dreams is still lacking today.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Psychologists and social scientists have studied dream content with quantitative
                    methods for decades, working with the hypothesis that dreams reveal
                    psychological information about the dreamer. One currently dominant theory in
                    this area is the <span class="hi italic">continuity hypothesis</span>, which assumes
                    that the content of dreams reflects a person’s daily life and personal concerns
                        [<a class="ref" href="#domhoff1996">Domhoff and Hall 1996</a>]. Previous studies on dream descriptions, i.e.
                    reported dreams written afterwards by the dreamer, have shown that around 75–80%
                    of dream content relates to everyday settings, characters, and activities. The
                    remaining dreams are related to uncommon or even bizarre topics. Some of the
                    latter are shared by numerous people, such as dreaming about flying, teeth
                    falling out, or being naked in public [<a class="ref" href="#domhoff2008">Domhoff and Schneider 2008</a>]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Dream descriptions are written reports of the memories of an experienced dream.
                    Even though much progress is made in neuroscience, it is not possible yet to
                    decode the dream content from a dreaming person’s brain activity. The only
                    possible way to gather dream contents is to study the reported recollection
                    produced when the experiencer was awake [<a class="ref" href="#domhoff1996">Domhoff and Hall 1996</a>]. For this
                    reason, we study written reports of remembered dreams. As a textual genre, this
                    type of written report bears similarities to other written recollections of
                    personal experiences, both in cognitive and sensory qualities [<a class="ref" href="#kahan2011">Kahan and LaBerge 2011</a>]. In this study we aim to investigate what linguistic
                    features are specific to dream reports, contrary to reports on personal stories
                    that actually happened, using tools for automatic text analysis. Computational
                    approaches to automatically analyze the content of dream reports from a
                    linguistic perspective are rare. In this work we want to pave the road for
                    further detailed and knowledge-directed research by presenting a first account
                    of a computational text analysis of dream reports.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">We performed three different types of automatic text analysis to investigate what

                    well-studied techniques from the field of computational linguistics can be
                    applied to offer insights into linguistic patterns hidden in large dream

                    is common in corpus linguistics and that has already been applied to dream

                    reports gathered in the last decades in various scientific studies. We use
                    DreamBank as the base for our study; we also collected a contrasting data sample
                    of true personal stories (from Reddit and Prosebox) to perform our experiments. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">We apply the following three methods: <em class="term">automatic text classification</em>
                    to investigate what features are actually salient for predicting whether a
                    written text is a dream report or not, <em class="term">topic modeling</em> to discover
                    the common themes in the dream collection, and <em class="term">text coherence
                        analysis</em> to measure whether there is a difference in coherence
                    between dreams and personal stories. Each of these methods offers a different
                    perspective on dream data. As we will argue, they do lead to overlapping
                    findings that we discuss in the last section. This paper is structured as
                    follows. We first discuss related work in automatic textual analysis of dream
                    reports and previous work on comparisons between dreams and stories in Section
                    2. We present the data sets used in the experiments in detail in Section 3.
                    Next, we present the three different studies we have done in Section 4, and we
                    summarize and discuss our findings in Section 5.</div>

                    Semi-automatic experiments have been performed by Bulkeley and Domhoff [2009],
                    who developed a systematic category list of word strings that can be used for
                    automated queries and word-frequency counts. The categories in which the words
                    are organized relate to the content of dreams, and are used to count mentions of
                    emotions, characters, perception, movement, cognition, and culture. In a more
                    recent follow-up study [<a class="ref" href="#bulkeley2014">Bulkeley 2014</a>] this category list is
                    updated and evaluated on four data sets present in the DreamBank corpus. The
                    study shows that one can use this type of word analysis to detect the general

                    narrative. A narrative consists of five or six structural units. It often starts
                    with an <em class="term">abstract</em>, which is a brief summary of the story, followed
                    by an <em class="term">orientation</em> that sketches the setting, location and actors of

                    the attitude of the author towards the story, signaling the purpose of the
                    story. The narrative is concluded with a <em class="term">resolution</em> to complete the

                        unsupervised method that is currently popular for discovering latent themes
                        or topics in large document collections. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
                            [<a class="ref" href="#blei2012">Blei 2012</a>] is a probabilistic generative algorithm that
                        aims to give a broad overview of the topics that occur in a collection of
                        documents. Topics are defined as a distribution over a fixed vocabulary (in
                        practice, a topic consists of a set of semantically related words). Topic
                        modeling is an unsupervised process solely based on word occurrences in
                        documents. LDA assumes that documents are created based on an underlying
                        topic distribution and each document is generated from a mixture of these
                        topics that each have a different proportion in the document. LDA uses an
                        iterative process to estimate this underlying distribution based on the
                        observed words in the text. </div>

                        tagged by the Stanford parser as nouns, verbs and adjectives. All words have
                        been converted to lower case. Such explicit filtering step ensures that the

                        Gibbs sampling and 50 topics. The produced LDA model was used to annotate
                        each document with its most relevant topics; namely those topics that cover
                        at least 10 percent of the document. Documents have three such topics on

                        weirdness as a typical property of dreams. This might be due to the fact
                        that many dreams are forgotten the next morning while weird or impressive
                        dreams tend to stick in people’s memory [<a class="ref" href="#bulkeley2011">Bulkeley and Hartmann 2011</a>]. This
                        recollection could be attributed to the bizarreness effect, the inclination
                        to remember bizarre things better than ordinary things [<a class="ref" href="#mcdaniel1995">McDaniel et al. 1995</a>]. Domhoff shows in [<a class="ref" href="#domhoff2007">Domhoff 2007</a>]
                        that bizarreness does occur in dreams, but it is not as manifest as people
                        tend to believe. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">Bizarreness can emerge in different forms in dreams. The most prominent type
                        of oddity seems to be caused by the discontinuity of events and sudden
                        switches of scenes. In the study of Reinsel et al. [<a class="ref" href="#reinsel1992">Reinsel et al. 1992</a>] bizarreness was measured by counting three
                        different type of occurrences: discontinuous events, improbable
                        combinations, and improbable entities. Discontinuous events were found to be
                        the most contributing factor in bizarreness (around 60% of the counts) while
                        improbable entities were much less present (only around 8%). This is in line
                        with previous studies on large volumes of dream reports that show that the
                        amount of bizarreness attributed to strange entities is relatively low; most
                        characters in dreams are known persons [<a class="ref" href="#domhoff2008">Domhoff and Schneider 2008</a>]. Domhoff
                            [<a class="ref" href="#domhoff2003">Domhoff 2003</a>, 132] investigated metamorphosis, a
                        specific type of discontinuous events, via a search in DreamBank.net and
                        found only 50 mentions of metamorphosis in the whole DreamBank.
                        Transformations turn out to be highly infrequent in dreams. [<a class="ref" href="#schweickert2010">Schweickert and Xi 2010</a>] study metamorphosis as a typical dream
                        phenomenon and focus on the relation between change in form to change in
                        inner states. No evidence was found that form change is connected to a
                        change in mental state. This was a small-scale study on a set of 65 dreams
                        from 21 persons. </div>

                        shared task. In total, about 40 thousand occurrences of these discourse
                        connectives were counted in the DreamBank data, and about 50 thousand in
                        both Reddit and Prosebox, which means that there are about 20% fewer
                        discourse markers counted in the DreamBank data than in the contrasting
                        data. In Figure 1 we show the distribution of 28 of the 60 markers in the

                        substantially more often with the dreams than with Prosebox or Reddit:
                            "then". This is a typical discourse connective that

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">We presented three automatic text analysis studies of dream reports. First, we
                    performed a supervised text classification experiment to see how easy or hard it
                    is to distinguish dream reports from texts that are closely related in both
                    content and structure, namely true personal stories. We applied three different
                    text classification algorithms to the same task; they all succeeded in labeling
                    the documents with a near-perfect precision. Differentiating between dreams and
                    personal stories turned out to be an easy task. The analysis of the features
                    used by the Balanced Winnow classifier shows that expressions of uncertainty,
                    setting descriptions and narrative verbs are typical for dreams, while time
                    expressions and conversational expressions are typical for the personal stories. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p59">59</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p59">In the second study we aimed to explore the general topics that are present in
                    the full DreamBank. We applied LDA topic modeling to the DreamBank to study the
                    main themes in dreams. The results mostly showed topics describing everyday
                    activities, settings, and characters. This unsupervised method signaled the same
                    differences as the text classification experiments between dreams and stories:
                    setting descriptions and uncertainty expressions are typical for dreams while
                    time expressions and conversational expressions occur more often in stories. In
                    our exploratory study on discontinuity in dreams, we observed that dream reports
                    indeed use less discourse markers and have a lower entity-based textual
                    coherence. With these experiments we are only just scratching the surface of
                    doing automatic discourse analysis but we feel that these preliminary
                    experiments are a starting point for further analyses in this direction.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p60">60</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p60">Even though our experiments have shown some interesting and consistent findings
                    about the typical differences between dreams and stories, we need to be careful
                    with our conclusions. The fact that the text classifiers obtained such high
                    scores and the topics were significantly differently distributed over the
                    samples, could indicate that the contrasting data sample was not as
                    representative as we had hoped for. The emerging topic about
                        "anxiety" for example shows that this subreddit had a
                    substantial influence on the results. The importance of conversational
                    expressions to distinguish personal stories in the classification experiment
                    also points to a bias of the source platforms. We suspect that a more careful
                    selection over a much larger set of personal stories, and perhaps an additional
                    check to filter out characteristic internet language is needed to create
                    automatic models that focus on the more subtle differences between reported
                    dreams and personal experiences from real life.</div>

                    dreams to investigate the effect of the sample representativeness. We also aim
                    to collaborate with dream analysis experts to work towards better
                    interpretations of the results that we found and to explore further research

                    analysis. Furthermore, we would like to investigate the applicability of the
