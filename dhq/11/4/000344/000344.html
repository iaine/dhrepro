                <p>This paper discusses a digital humanities collection called "Contemporary Telepathics" housed within a larger archive, <cite class="title italic">The Fabric of Digital Life</cite>. We argue that through a
                    variety of multimedia representations, the rhetoric of contemporary telepathic
                    devices invokes sublime predictive visions that become instantiated in popular
                    media, news organizations, and disclosures of technology advancement. We discuss
                    the theoretical grounds for a collection of technological forecasts, at a time
                    when they are largely considered ephemera. We also discuss how tracking the
                        <em class="term">telepathic sublime</em> as a dynamically evolving popular
                    communication phenomenon requires a unique, humanities-based metadata scheme and
                    archival practice.</p>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">This paper explores a phenomenon that we term the <em class="term">telepathic sublime</em> and
                it proposes a way to classify and display it through an archived digital collection.
                As digital participants, people are assailed with predictions of how we will
                    <em class="emph">work</em>, <em class="emph">live</em> or <em class="emph">be</em> in the future. For
                instance, self-driving cars are proposed as technical feats, but the excitement lies
                in neo-futurist speculations that everyday lives will transform due to their use. In
                this vein, we are concerned with how the rhetoric surrounding contemporary
                telepathic devices evinces predictive visions that filter into popular media, news
                organizations, popular film, and public opinion through a variety of multimedia
                representations. We emphasize that it is characterized by descriptions that point to
                the sublime. We argue that tracking the <em class="term">telepathic sublime</em> as a
                dynamically evolving rhetorical phenomenon requires a unique, humanities-based
                metadata scheme and archival practice. We use the term "tracking"
                to highlight the ways in which the archive follows discourse through the lifecycle
                of invention. In characterizing and tracking the telepathic sublime, we argue that
                technologic advancement ought not to be separated from the euphoria associated with
                it. The contribution we make in this article and the associated archive is to
                explore the notion of telepathic sublime: name it as a concept, digitally collect,
                co-locate and track it, display it aesthetically, and reveal how it influences
                scientific advancements and attitudes over time.</div>

                communication of thoughts from one person’s mind to another person’s mind without
                using words, signals, gestures, or other traditional forms of communication. We use
                the Contemporary Telepathics collection to cluster related digital technologies that
                    <em class="emph">appear</em> to work telepathically. <em class="term">Digital telepathy</em> is
                defined as direct communication of thoughts from one person’s mind to a computer (or
                computer-like device) or another person through a digital medium rather than
                traditional (linguistic) media. A related concept is <em class="term">digital
                    telekinesis,</em> defined as movement of digital or material objects by the
                mind, and augmented by a computing device. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In 2000, researchers at Duke University affixed monkeys with experimental head
                    caps to measure the brain’s "raw electrical activity" to see
                    if "action potential" could be sent along a wire to a nearby
                    box [<a class="ref" href="#nicolelis2008">Nicolelis and Chapin 2008</a>]. Called a "Harvey box"
                    after its inventor Harvey Wiggins, the container amplified signals to
                    distinguish between the monkey’s myriad thoughts. More than just a mind reading
                    device, researchers hoped to use the signals to remotely control a robotic arm
                    six hundred miles away. The inventors recount their own amazement with the
                    experiment: "We will always remember our sense of awe as we
                            eavesdropped on the processes by which the primate brain generates a
                            thought"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#nicolelis2008">Nicolelis and Chapin 2008</a>]. They hoped to create a device for telekinesis.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">The article discussing the experiment in telekinesis appeared in a 2008 <cite class="title italic">Scientific American Reports</cite> magazine under the cover
                    headline "Your Future with Robots," which also
                    included articles by futurists like Bill Gates, Hans Moravec and Ray Kurzweil.
                    The discussion of the experiment within a broader thematic of the technological
                    future fulfilled two purposes. First, it recounted a feat of technology in the
                    creation of a brain-machine interface to serve as a historical record of the
                    advancement. Second, it also expressed the speculative potential for the future
                    of the technology as a forecast meant to garner excitement in its readership.
                    This latter point, about the speculative potential and predictions of telepathic
                    technologies, has a surprisingly long history. For example, Giambattista della
                    Porta (1535-1615) claimed to harness subtle forms of magnetism through various
                    contraptions to "express all the sentiments of your mind" to a "friend who is distant"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#devries2012">De Vries 2012</a>, 103]. Where della Porta drew on the field of cryptography for his
                    technological explanations, William Benjamin Carpenter (1813-1885) later argued
                    that a "nerve-force" could extend "from a distance, so as
                        to bring the Brain of one person into direct dynamical communication with
                        that of another," drawing on the new technology of telegraphy [<a class="ref" href="#puglionesi2017">Puglionesi 2017</a>]. Today, this kind of technological solutioneering
                    is likely to arise in popular news broadcasts, research articles, start-up
                    company concept videos, films, social media exchange, and military documents.
                    Indeed, Dan Kaplan argues in a recent <cite class="title italic">Techcrunch</cite>
                    article called "Digital Telepathy Is The Future Of The Human
                        Species" that "the prospect of digital telepathy will eventually stop
                            being a prospect we can only attempt to imagine and start being a
                            reality that some of us live"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#kaplan2014">Kaplan 2014</a>]. Fascination with the invention of digital telepathy and similar
                    technology continues with the same enthusiasm and grandeur as it did in the
                    past.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The Contemporary Telepathics collection we discuss here deliberately archives
                    this aspect of prediction, forecast, and possibility by foregrounding
                    representations that celebrate <em class="emph">imagination</em> as means and motivator
                    for innovation, through texts that are usually considered ephemera. By using the
                    word <em class="term">telepathics</em>, rather than <em class="term">telepathy</em>, we draw on
                    the polyvalent meanings bound up in the word. <em class="term">Telepathic</em> means
                    relating to the characteristic of telepathy (e.g., mind-reading technology), but
                    it also means a person who has the ability to read minds (e.g., she is a
                        <em class="term">telepathic</em>). As discussed below, the <cite class="title italic">Fabric</cite> archive is devoted to personal technology, so,
                    appropriately, the word <em class="term">telepathic</em> implies identity or selfhood
                    within the larger ontological space of the archive’s themes.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">The metaphor behind the archive’s name, Fabric of Digital Life, references a
                    famous prediction made in 1991 by Mark Weiser, Chief Scientist at Xerox PARC: "The most profound technologies are those that
                            disappear. They weave themselves into the <em class="emph">fabric of everyday
                                life</em> until they are indistinguishable from it"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#weiser1991">Weiser 1991</a>, emphasis added]. As a slogan, the "fabric of everyday life" offers a way to reflect
                    on Weiser’s bold claim. Weiser’s dream of technological disappearance is itself
                    indebted to previous socio-technical scholars: he cites Martin Heidegger and
                    Hans Georg Gadamer directly. However, the design of <cite class="title italic">Fabric</cite> is also inspired by the writings of media, rhetoric, and
                    communications scholars Marshall McLuhan, Jean Baudrillard, Walter Benjamin, and
                    Kenneth Burke, which underpin our analysis of the telepathic sublime. The <cite class="title italic">Fabric</cite> archive reflects the writings of these scholars

                    Johanna Drucker’s <cite class="title italic">SpecLab,</cite> where Drucker and her
                    collaborators pushed the bounds of artistic, critical, and practical forms of
                    scholarship. Drucker distinguished her goals with <cite class="title italic">SpecLab</cite> from the digital humanities more generally in describing
                        <cite class="title italic">SpecLab</cite> as moving beyond "the instrumental, well-formed, and increasingly
                            standardized business of digital humanities"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">Drucker 2009</a>, 19]. Instead, she argued that <cite class="title italic">SpecLab</cite> used
                        "digital metatexts" to create
                        "aesthesis"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">Drucker 2009</a>, 19]. According to Drucker, digital metatext is
                    not merely a commentary on a set of texts (as might be envisioned within a
                        "traditional" digital humanities project). Instead,
                    digital metatexts contain features and functions that enable analysis, search,
                    selection, and display, which (alongside their metadata schemes) are capable of
                    structuring and grouping elements [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">Drucker 2009</a>, 11]. Through
                    these discursive instruments, metatexts "bring the object of their inquiry
                        into being" while developing a sense of aesthesis—the partial, situated,
                    and subjective knowledges that are as "ideological... as epistemological"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2009">Drucker 2009</a>, xiii]. The goal of <cite class="title italic">SpecLab</cite>, therefore, is to
                    challenge "the authority of… systematic rationality by questioning
                            its founding assumptions, particularly its totalizing concepts of

                    unfolding in public discourse. We make the telepathic sublime salient by
                    bringing the object of inquiry "into being" through the

                    predict, or forecast a time when it will be normal to move objects with only a
                    mind or to make choices just by thinking of them (e.g., <cite class="title italic">Turn on the lights</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Play some Mozart on my

                    forecasts usually involve hyped speculation about the future. Moreover, many of
                    the innovations are discussed <em class="emph">as if</em> they will emerge and be
                    adopted, even though many will not. Nonetheless, the cultural work (and
                    ephemera) that they instigate is significant. <cite class="title italic">Fabric</cite> deliberately preserves and tracks this kind of rhetoric.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p16">16</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p16">Many writers have looked at the rhetorical strategies associated with forecasting
                    the future, the technological sublime, and technocultural myths. According to
                    Daniel Bell, in <cite class="title italic">The Coming of Post-Industrial Society: A
                        Venture in Social Forecasting </cite>(1976), forecasting is a critical part
                    of the "post-industrial" society. Forecasts typically involve
                    concrete facts and constraints about the world, but they are often framed
                    axiomatically, and in some cases are buttressed by statistical extrapolations.
                    For example, engineers often forecast industrial design in aluminum with
                    predictive assessments. Statements concerning maximum compositional strength of
                    aluminum will dictate design decisions and visions about how something will end
                    up looking—that is, how thin and light the end result can be. The compositional
                    strength of aluminum is therefore a constraint, which is then coordinated with
                    axioms of design (how it <em class="emph">will</em> look), alongside existing scientific
                    and market knowledge and sometimes mathematical modelling. Taken together, these
                    aspects become a form of predictive and persuasive reasoning. Once the
                    predictive and persuasive reasoning stabilizes, the forecast will often take the
                    rhetorical form of scientific fact. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17">Carolyn Miller (1994), identifies the rhetoric of forecasting in technological
                    discourse, grounding her claims on the term "Kairos"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#miller1994">Miller 1994</a>, 82]. Miller defines "the phenomenon of
                        ‘technological forecasting’" as a unique discourse "in which the characterization and construction of
                            moments in the present are crucial to the projection of the
                            future"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#miller1994">Miller 1994</a>, 82]. Kairos, then, is an active rhetorical process whereby forecasts leverage
                    the inventor or rhetor’s will, as acts of opportunism. A rhetor will "look for the particular opportunity in a given moment,
                            to find—or construct—an opening in the here and now, in order to achieve
                            something there and then"

                    who argues in the context of the recent emergence of personal digital devices
                    that the desire for human digital enhancement is driven by hype and predictive
                    discourses, which frame future inventions as assumed inevitabilities. Pedersen
                    uses Kenneth Burke’s "Terms for Order"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#burke1950">Burke 1950</a>, 189] as a model to explain how predictive
                    discourses require rhetorics of inevitability. She makes the point that such
                    predictive discourses are grounded on a rhetorical construction of imminence–an
                        "ultimate order"–which makes them appear logical,
                    necessary, and unretractable [<a class="ref" href="#pedersen2013">Pedersen 2013</a>, 27]. Pedersen
                    describes the "imminence" of the rhetoric of technological forecasting as
                    such: <blockquote><p>
                        [They] exhibit a progression across the rhetorical triad
                            in the language that informs them. They signal fantastical thoughts and
                            ambitions, which generate rhetorical "What if?"
                            momentum. However, to counter utopian visions, all of these technologies
                            undergo emergence through scientists who both leverage fantasy and
                            dismiss it while justifying the technology, often under the guise of
                            dehumanizing language. Most powerfully, though, the technology often
                            mysteriously appears as inevitable, as utterly imminent.
                         [<a class="ref" href="#pedersen2013">Pedersen 2013</a>, 25]
                    </p></blockquote> In this formulation, utopic claims about inventions are utilized by
                    scientists, and then grounded by the assumption of imminence for their
                    emergence.</div>

                    constitute the allure of new technologies, together resulting in the feeling of
                    sublime. Throughout history, discussions surrounding telepathic devices have
                    usually been met with feelings of enthusiastic amazement combined with shock. In
                    fact, this response is typical of the initial emergence of most modern
                    technologies, which is why these technologies have been described as sublime.
                    Emily Rohrbach describes the sublime as a propensity to imagine the present in
                    its relation to futurity [<a class="ref" href="#rohrbach2016">Rohrbach 2016</a>]. Historically, and most
                    famously articulated by Edmund Burke and Immanuel Kant, the sublime is an
                    aesthetic experience related to but ultimately distinct from feelings of beauty.
                    Unlike beauty, the sublime so fully fills the mind (usually with terror or awe),
                    that other feelings and reasoning are excluded. The classic case of sublime is
                    found in the work of the Victorian painter Joseph Turner, whose dramatic
                    shipwrecks were the typical subjects of sublimity, evoking transcendent
                        terror.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2654e718">[3]</a> However, as James Carey and John

                    common belief, which therefore guides social determinations and justifications.
                    In other words, the sublime informs how manifold inventions are perceived and
                    taken up in society, and therefore, how such inventions work to subsequently
                    shape attitudes toward future inventions. The digital sublime informs future
                    digital conditions.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">An extreme version of Mosco’s digital sublime is described by Anne C. McCarthy
                    (2017), which she calls the "Red Bull sublime." Referencing
                    the popular energy drink and media company, the Red Bull sublime fully rejects
                    the ideology of nature as other, or as a distinct site of sublime experience.
                    The Red Bull sublime is in essence a digital sublime, as it takes advantage of
                    social media sharing and digital distribution to <em class="emph">pull</em> viewers into
                    sublime experiences. These sublime experiences are usually already-mediated
                    feats of daredevil action, both natural and technical, made possible by wing
                    suits, so as to fly down mountain canyons, and high-tech balloons to jump from
                    space [<a class="ref" href="#mccarthy2017">McCarthy 2017</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p22">22</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p22">The role of myth in the digital sublime is especially important for turning the
                    common practices of speculation and forecasting into "facts."
                    Barthes, for example, argues that the "depoliticized speech" of myth
                    produces an important naturalizing effect, writing, "myth has the task of giving an historical intention a
                            natural justification, and making contingency appear eternal"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#barthes1972">Barthes 1972</a>, 142]. Just as Bell believed forecasting was an important agent in the
                    post-industrial society, Barthes believed that the mythic process of making
                    contingency appear eternal was a reflection of bourgeois (or capitalist)
                    ideology. This process is seen most clearly when inventions are developed,
                    commercialized, and adopted, then subsequently, change in response to the latent
                    circulation of commercial myths. Once myth becomes ossified and stable these
                    commitments become history, or "facts." Myth progresses not
                    through true or false claims, but instead, as a transformation from productive
                    and predictive desires, on the one hand, and ossified and stable commitments, on
                    the other. Finally, productive and predictive myths project a view of the world,
                    which entails the collective beliefs of its community. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p23">23</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p23">As our examples of telepathic technology will make clear (below), predictions of
                    the future often start as mythic, which over time stabilize into fact. Facts,
                    just because they are stabilized, do not lack efficacy, rather, they are myths
                    turned invisible, and usually become powerful through this reconfiguration.
                    Electricity offers an example of this dynamic of myth, and the subsequent
                    increase in causal power. Mosco writes, "electricity achieved its real power when it left
                            mythology and entered banality"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#mosco2004">Mosco 2004</a>, 19–20]. Of course, facts can be overturned and changed, but this takes
                    considerable effort. The infrastructures and institutions built up around facts
                    are slow to change or fade, and true innovation, as Latour [<a class="ref" href="#latour1999">Latour 1999</a>] often describes, requires putting your reputation on
                    the line, and fighting against the structuring forces already in place. In the
                    end, when a myth has accreted sufficient “rationality” it becomes fact, just as
                    forecasting transforms into science and the scientific sublime.</div>

                    technology is here understood as broadly as possible, which includes
                    technologies that are worn on the body, but also those that are ingested,
                    implanted or embedded. Wearable technologies usually augment embodied actions,
                    but they also sometimes replace body parts, such as limbs or eyes, pointing to
                    the terms "embedded" and bionic, which sit on the fringe of
                    this collection, with some entries characterizing it. At the time of writing,

                    Core set of metadata elements. However, early on in the development of the
                    archive, the decision was made to customize a few of the standard Dublin Core
                    elements, to better reflect the specialized nature of the technologies being
                    archived, and to implicitly make an argument about the ways that such objects,
                    and the archival practices that surround them, are to be understood. In addition
                    to metadata attached to each artifact, the archive also features a number of
                    collections of artifacts, organized by curators with the goal to highlight

                        the telepathic sublime in the Contemporary Telepathics collection, a
                        phenomenon about the response of awe, terror, or amazement over
                        technological inventions that augment or replace the power, distance, or
                        effect of existing human capacities. These sentiments tap into an
                        individual’s or culture’s experience of the future—that is, using telepathic
                        devices often feels <em class="emph">futuristic</em>. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28">Perhaps most pragmatically, the archive also collects and tracks digital
                        materials related to an invention through its various stages of development
                        and public promotion or public response. As such, the archive follows
                        discourses over time by tracking cross-references and keyword designations.
                        One design intent for the archive is to reflect how an artefact is
                        positioned according to a function or human motivation. Discourses about
                        telepathic devices (and more broadly, "wearables"),
                        concentrate on how these devices will be used <em class="emph">for</em>
                        something—they have a "for-ness"—rather than just being
                            <em class="emph">about</em> something ("aboutness"). <cite class="title italic">Fabric</cite> distinguishes itself from technology
                        indexes such as the ACM Computing Classification System in this regard,
                        which implicitly focus on "aboutness."<a class="noteRef" href="#d2654e889">[5]</a> Instead,
                        it sets out to problematize this orientation, strategically tracking how

                        result, the effect can sometimes blur optimal pathways for searching,
                        browsing, and information retrieval. </div>

                        Each focus on a particular topic, theme, or argument. At the time of

                        14 different media types ranging from 1999 to 2017. </div>

                        motivations and arguments. In one such collection, the goal is to reveal how

                        producers in close partnership with global Hollywood film franchises (e.g.,

                        In this collection, video game play has also been archived to reveal how
                        fictional exoskeletons influence real world innovation, and vice versa.
                        Another collection concentrates on the evolving story of inventor/filmmaker
                        Rob Spence and his journey to create a digital prosthetic eye for
                            himself.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2654e915">[7]</a>

                        especially compelling when collected under a single banner. Ultimately, each
                        collection performs a specific task and offers a curatorial argument, set
                        out by the curator (or a number of curators) responsible for its
                        construction.</div>

                        Varela describes as the transience of archives: "[t]raditional archivists could assert that digital
                                archives are not really built to endure the passage of time and
                                constitute a repository for future historical research"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#varela2016">Varela 2016</a>]. Addressing this challenge, Takhteyev and DuPont point to the spirit
                        of "remix" in suggesting that collection and preservation
                        are "living, ongoing practice[s]"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#takhteyev2013">Takhteyev and DuPont 2013</a>, 362]. We embrace this state of flux and try to overcome the challenges
                        wrought by the passage of time by inviting new people to the archiving team,
                        who then create new archival practices and advocate for new ideas. Varela
                        argues that digital archives should be considered performance in part
                        because "[o]ften the archives are not impersonal, but highly
                                modified by the interests of the participants"

                        contributions by more than thirty people, even before it was opened for
                        public display.</div>

                            Place" to create the technology prototype for TV viewers [<a class="ref" href="#alred2015">Alred et al. 2015</a>]. As such, the video combines executives and
                        developers passionately celebrating their innovative mind-control technology
                        and BBC insiders reacting with shock and awe over how television will evolve
                        in the future. To open the clip, Head of Business Development, BBC Digital,
                        Cyrus Saihan says: <blockquote><p>
                            What we have developed here is a very experimental
                                proof-of-concept that hopefully gives an idea as to how audiences of
                                the future might be able to control devices, such as TVs, just using
                                their brainwaves. So, seeing colleagues using it first-hand has been
                                an interesting experience.
                             [<a class="ref" href="#alred2015">Alred et al. 2015</a>]
                        </p></blockquote>The video reports on future promises as much as it does on current
                        developments. While This Place wants to <em class="emph">sell</em> its technological
                        abilities (e.g., writing software code, re-engineering of consumer devices,
                        etc.), the BBC wants to appear future-focused and on the cusp of emergent
                        ideas. On the whole, the technology itself is clunky, with awkward
                        brain-computer interaction (BCI) headsets and slow interactions as the
                        television receives the signal. However, the point of the video is not to
                        market a product, rather, the point is to position the BBC as forecasting a
                        future for its consumers. The video is compelling to watch because the
                        participants are awestruck when describing their desire to achieve
                        telekinetics. The visual rhetorical markers from participants, such as
                        excited expressions, gleeful remarks, and the sense that one has witnessed
                        magic, aligns well with the heritage of telepathic invention disclosures.
                        One person in the video says: "[t]his is telekinesis… I am literally
                            controlling it with my mind," as if he witnessed phenomena deemed
                        extraordinary [<a class="ref" href="#alred2015">Alred et al. 2015</a>].</div>

                            A subject popular in works of fiction is the ability
                                to control things just by using your mind. The idea of being able to
                                simply think about something and then magically make it happen has
                                fascinated people for many years. Whether it’s using ‘the Force’ in
                                Star Wars, spoon bending on stage or The Matrix, controlling objects
                                simply with your brain has a unique appeal and could open up a whole
                                world of possibilities. So when we learnt that new technologies were
                                now available in the market that allowed you to control electronic
                                devices by measuring the brain’s electrical activity, we wanted to

                        changing attitudes? Is there an audience shaped by the genre? Or, returning
                        to a point made earlier, how might the artifact inform the digital as a

                        intent emerges over time. News of a single piece of technology may go
                        through several stages, each with an intentional and rhetorical shift
                        according to the genre and content producer. For example, a brain interface
                        may transform from its representation in an academic conference paper
                            (<em class="emph">academic</em>), to a news broadcast celebrating an innovative
                        R&amp;D discovery (<em class="emph">information</em>), to a commercial product
                            (<em class="emph">advertisement</em>), and finally, to a novel that interrogates
                        its dystopic implications (<em class="emph">art</em>). According to Diana Taylor,
                        this process of tracking across media and temporal stages is "what makes
                            an object archival" in the sense that "it is selected, classified, and presented for
                                analysis"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#taylor2003">Taylor 2003</a>, 19]. In this hypothetical example, these shifts in media would be
                        captured in <cite class="title italic">Fabric</cite> by each artifact’s metadata:
                        shifting classification from <em class="emph">academic</em>,
                        <em class="emph">information</em>, <em class="emph">advertisement</em>, to <em class="emph">art</em>. </div>

                        carried near, on, or in a body, which is recorded in the metadata schema.
                        The metadata category "location on the body" lets a user
                        select a body part in order to find associated technologies, ideas, or
                        products. For example, one can select <em class="emph">wrist</em> to reveal all
                        wrist-worn wearables, and then compare how artifacts and their
                        representations change over time. In the Contemporary Telepathics
                        collection, nearly all items are associated with <em class="emph">brain</em>, but
                        several are also indexed with another body part. For example, inventor Kevin
                        Warwick achieves telekinesis with an arm implant, and so the artifacts
                        describing his work also include <em class="emph">arm</em> in their metadata. To help
                        facilitate high-level comparisons, <cite class="title italic">Fabric</cite> also
                        includes a body analytics visualization.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2654e1171">[11]</a>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">One of the more experimental metadata categories of the archive is the
                            "augmenting" field. It is meant to serve as an
                        experiential classification. All artifacts are archived according to an
                        action associated with human activities, which may be physical (e.g.,
                        moving, placing, killing), cognitive (e.g., thinking, choosing) or
                        existential (e.g., living, adoring, reminiscing).<a class="noteRef" href="#d2654e1187">[12]</a>
                        Manifesting the archive’s experimental and unorthodox approach, the
                        grammatical structure is always a gerund, as gerunds better suggest activity
                        and "for-ness" (see Table 1). </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">In requiring archivists to capture the ways that wearables augment a body,
                        the archivist must imagine what the technology is augmenting for a
                        seemingly, essentialized, pre-technologic human. This formulation
                        deliberately requires the archivist to cast a narrative about the implied
                        subject of an artifact, that is: if technology were <em class="emph">not</em>
                        available, how would the implied action be performed? Or, what would it be
                        replaced with, if at all? For example, surveillance technologies augment
                            <em class="emph">watching</em>, eldercare devices augment <em class="emph">caring</em> (or
                        perhaps <em class="emph">ignoring</em>), and military exoskeletons might augment
                            <em class="emph">killing</em> or <em class="emph">protecting</em>. Interestingly, new
                        archivists often misidentify this category by choosing technologic
                        activities (e.g., "heart-monitoring" instead of
                            "living" or "healing"). Resolving
                        this mistake requires a tacit exploration of posthuman identity through the
                        acts prescribed by these technologies. The archivist must therefore ask,
                            "can we imagine activities without machines?" The archival goal is
                        to explore how personal technologies augment constructions of human identity
                        and human action, and to understand how they adapt to a technological
                        world.</div>

                        theorization and scholarly attention in the humanities, and specifically
                        across the visual arts. We use the term to characterize the sense of intense
                        inspiration framed in representations that promote these technologies, which
                        claim to alter human cognition and thinking as a subjective practice. The
                        emphasis lies in how sublime constructions facilitate this shift in digital
                        conditions, discussed earlier.</div><div class="endnote" id="d2654e827"><span class="noteRef">[4]</span> The process to choose a suitable content management system
                        for the archive involved input from software developers, students,
                        librarians and online discussion. We also considered Omeka (<a class="ref" href="https://omeka.org/" onclick="window.open('https://omeka.org/'); return false">https://omeka.org/</a>) and DSpace (<a class="ref" href="http://www.dspace.org/" onclick="window.open('http://www.dspace.org/'); return false">http://www.dspace.org/</a>).
                        Currently, we hire developers at Whirl-i-gig to customize the

                            most actions defy this triadic reduction. Killing might be physical,
                            cognitive, or existential. However, considering this complexity helps
                            the archival practice. If we consider inventions as an aspect of lived
                            experience, this field helps us identify technical innovation in a
