                <p> Digital Humanities BeNeLux is a grass roots initiative to foster knowledge
                    networking and dissemination in digital humanities in Belgium, the Netherlands,
                    and Luxembourg. This special issue highlights a selection of the work that was
                    presented at the DHBenelux 2015 Conference by way of anthology for the digital
                    humanities currently being done in the Benelux area and beyond. The introduction
                    describes why this grass roots initiative came about and how DHBenelux is
                    currently supporting community building and knowledge exchange for digital
                    humanities in the Benelux area and how this is integrating regional digital
                    humanities in the larger international digital humanities environment. </p>
            </div>
            
        
        
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Commencing in 2014, the Digital Humanities BeNeLux initiative originated from a group
                of researchers and practitioners from Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. This
                set of researchers felt that there was a need for a platform for people whose work
                related to or involved digital humanities methodology but whose work was not as
                academically visible as it could be. These people seemed to especially lack specific
                academic outlets to communicate their work. As a result, the DH Benelux
                        conference<a class="noteRef" href="#d20489e270">[1]</a> builds a platform for collaboration,
                connecting international researchers in the field of Digital Humanities from the
                Benelux region together with researchers from the European Union and beyond. The
                conference has a broad disciplinary range, from a diverse array of research
                projects. It is targeted at building a community that bridges the gap between early
                career researchers and eminent academic scholars. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">From their own experience the researchers and practitioners who started the
                initiative knew that over the past two decades the use of digital and computational
                techniques and methods in the humanities in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg
                had been on the rise [<a class="ref" href="#zundert2014">van Zundert and Dalen-Oskam 2014</a>]. However, most instances of such
                techniques and methods advancing humanities research emerged in disciplinary related
                isolated pockets of methodological innovation. This mode of rather compartmented
                innovation arguably has been exacerbated by the region's rich quilt of smaller
                language communities. Within the BeNeLux the major official languages are Dutch and
                French. However, it would be more fair to summarize the language situation as at
                least a patchwork of West and East Flemish, Zeelandic, Dutch, Frisian, West Low
                German, Limburgish, French, Luxembourgish, and German. And even that summarization
                is just an approximation of the actual number of distinctly separate languages
                spoken in the area. Often methodological innovation has been tied to the
                interdisciplinary curiosity and stamina of individuals involved with research in
                language, literature, culture or history. Sometimes it resulted from modest
                interdisciplinary collaboration between individuals from different disciplines such
                as humanities and computer science or software engineering. Though their work was
                interdisciplinary in nature there was little knowledge exchange between the
                innovators of methodology themselves: they would collaborate with computer
                scientists or would import knowledge from software engineering into their own work,
                but they would do so from the relative isolation of their own humanities
                sub-discipline or institutional context (e.g. libraries or archives). Much like
                grassroots digital humanities emerging elsewhere we suppose, there was little
                overarching coordinated effort and knowledge exchange. Due to the strong local,
                independent, and autonomous progress of method, there was little incentive and not
                many opportunities for innovators to network, to share their knowledge, and to
                leverage the experience from comparable innovations from like-minded practitioners
                in other humanities disciplines. As such, these researchers and practitioners had
                little opportunity to obtain peer-level feedback and reflection on the pioneering
                digital and computational work they were undertaking. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Arguably the disjunct and isolated nature of computational and digital methodological
                innovation in the humanities in the Benelux has in many cases resulted in such
                innovations being relatively short lived. Often innovative studies go unrecognized
                as relevant methodological contribution or as research contributions in themselves
                    [<a class="ref" href="#schreibman2011">Schreibman et al. 2011</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="#dalenoskam2013">Van Dalen-Oskam 2013</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="#besser2013">Besser and Vaeseens 2013</a>, 194]. New methods and techniques might serve a
                particular research project, only to evanesce quickly after researchers moved on.
                Digital humanities innovation has often been judged a "parade of
                    prototypes"
                [<a class="ref" href="#wouters2007">Wouters and Beaulieu 2007</a>], questioning the viability and validity of
                computational methods in the humanities (and elsewhere). If no steady user groups
                can be identified and if no considerable impact can be measured, then where is the
                clear and decisive benefit of this work? The argument however can be mirrored: if
                interdisciplinary innovative work is not recognized and if there is no cross-domain
                support for it, just how much long lasting and generic impact can we expect these
                methods to have?</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">Digital humanities has had its advocates and antagonists in the Benelux region just
                as it has had in other places. Though stark accusations of a neoliberal plot [<a class="ref" href="#allington2016">Allington et al. 2016</a>] have not been voiced, certainly researchers have
                pointed out a "silent ideology" underpinning a perceived
                    "push" for digital and computational methods. Piersma and
                Ribbens for instance point to the fact that digital technology is still often
                presented as a neutral technology that is thus pervasive enough to make non-digital
                methods obsolete in the very near future [<a class="ref" href="#piersma2013">Piersma and Ribbens 2013</a>]. They also
                argue that only rarely the underlying assumptions of the technologies and methods
                are questioned. In their view, these assumptions almost always point to an
                application of the empirical, quantitative, "scientistic" style
                of research. However, increasingly we see attention for the hermeneutic and
                abductive reasoning<a class="noteRef" href="#d20489e310">[2]</a> potential of
                computational methods too. Certainly from an international perspective [<a class="ref" href="#capurro2010">Capurro 2010</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="#flanders2009">Flanders 2009</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="#gibbs2012">Gibbs and Owens 2012</a>], but progressively also in the Benelux [<a class="ref" href="#beyen2013">Beyen 2013</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="#zundert2016">van Zundert 2016</a>]. Thus methodological reflection, particularly on the
                assumptions underlying computational methods may not abound, but it certainly seems
                to find some traction. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">This–i.e. a potential modest rise in methodological reflection and the formation of
                theory–is arguably a good thing, as it points to the emergence of a theoretical
                stance that has been called for more than once [<a class="ref" href="#liu2012">Liu 2012</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="#robinson2013">Robinson 2013</a>]
                [<a class="ref" href="#mccarty2016">McCarty 2016</a>]. As one colleague aptly put it: method is the
                combination of theory with technique. If, as many seem to claim, digital humanities
                is a field, and a field of methodological interest foremost, then it cannot do
                without theory. And for that matter: can any academic field do strictly without
                theory? However, is it not far too early to speak of anything like theory with a
                capital "T" in digital humanities. We rather seem to be in the
                stage where each prototype is (or should at least be) a contribution to the
                formation of theory, which somehow emerges out of practice. Every database is a
                theory somehow [<a class="ref" href="#bauer2011">Bauer 2011</a>], every digital edition is an argument [<a class="ref" href="#shillingsburg2013">Shillingsburg 2013</a>]. What we have not figured out so far is how to
                connect these individual dots of theory-turned-practical-prototype to mesh into a
                greater fabric that can be called theory of digital humanities.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">Which takes us in a way full circle to the current status of digital humanities in
                the Benelux region. To practitioners in the field, the grand gestures and sweeping
                statements on theory and underlying assumptions of method are–apologies for the
                hyperbolic imagery–like the grand plans made up by generals being put to foot
                soldiers on the ground who are merely figuring out what works. They are digging
                trenches to shelter themselves from everything that is thrown at them from all
                sides, including organizational politics, institutional and funding policies, the
                resistance and accusations of traditional humanists, the overstretched promises of
                computational utopists, and difficult but justified questions of critical theorists.
                Many practitioners feel that this is too grand a challenge to be posed on digital
                humanities so soon: too much calling for unifying theory, too often questioning
                    "where's the beef?"
                [<a class="ref" href="#scheinfeldt2010">Scheinfeldt 2010</a>]. Like big infrastructures are a form of premature
                optimization for experimentation in the digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#zundert2012">van Zundert 2012</a>], so is calling for unified theories of it all while
                practitioners and researchers are merely figuring out <em class="emph">what</em> it is that
                we see with our new "microscopes" rather than <em class="emph">why</em>.
                We would argue therefore that the current state of praxis of digital humanities in
                the Benelux is excellent and appropriate. It is in an incubator era: the creation of
                prototypes thrives, many experimental projects are initiated. DH in the Benelux
                region is currently very rich, varied and diverse. A creative quilt that includes
                all: from advanced long term research by highly visible key players to many one off
                experimental projects, from institutionalized large infrastructure development to
                maker community projects tagging along on a shoestring. Prototypes indeed, and many
                of them. We would contend: the more the better. Computationally we still are just
                scratching at the surface of what we can do in the humanities with digital and
                computational methods. From this "prototype soup" some
                methodological commons and digital humanities theory may arise, but only if there
                are enough venues for practitioners to communicate and discuss and examine
                critically their methods and results.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Exactly for this–allowing practitioners to communicate and reflect on a
                methodological level–the DH Benelux platform was initiated. The digital humanities
                researchers and practitioners that initiated the platform wanted to facilitate the
                possibility to pioneers of computational and digital technologies in the humanities
                to share and learn from each other's work. They were much less concerned with a
                particular computational ideology or the establishment of a field. Even less, we
                would argue, were they occupied with institutional or organizational politics. They
                were simply looking for ways to mesh the individual nodes of methodological
                innovation into a fabric that would more effectively support computational and
                digital methods in the humanities in the Benelux. DH Benelux has therefore primarily
                been a <em class="emph">community fostering collaboration</em>: an informally governed group
                that furthers the networking and integration of distributed digital and
                computational methodological knowledge through community building. This is still at
                the core of DH Benelux: fostering knowledge exchange and collaboration on a
                methodological level. Most DH'ers seem not too concerned at all with questioning
                whether digital humanities is a field or "just" a temporary
                methodological pidgin, whether theory should have additional focus or not. That is
                not to say these questions are not important–we think they are. But the answers
                should emerge from the rich quilt of praxis that drives institutionalization of this
                methodological knowledge into digital humanities curricula that are slowly appearing
                on the map of the Benelux.<a class="noteRef" href="#d20489e378">[3]</a>

            <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">Within its three years of existence the DH Benelux Conference has now become the
                foremost means for the Benelux digital humanities community to communicate, share
                and integrate knowledge. The first DH Benelux Conference took place in 2014. In The
                Hague at the National Library of the Netherlands some eighty presenters contributed
                77 accepted submissions. Participants obviously derived from the three related
                countries. However, also a relatively large contingent joined from beyond these
                countries, which testifies to the embedding of the community in the larger region.
                The conference has since seen rising numbers of participants, a rising number of
                submissions (thus sadly also more rejections) and each year more contributions (from
                104 presentations in 2015 in Antwerp, to currently 125 in 2016 in Luxembourg).
                Meanwhile the DHBenelux initiative also became a partner organization to the EADH<a class="noteRef" href="#d20489e392">[4]</a>, stretching
                its outreach further as may be gauged from submissions now including originating
                countries as far as the US and Taiwan. Further analysis of the audience and
                submissions show that the conference "is definitely not a clique of people who know one another,
                        but actually a varied and growing community"
                     [<a class="ref" href="#kemman2016">Kemman 2016</a>].</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">The DH Benelux Conference as a platform is still developing. The second conference in
                2015 was the first to experiment with possibilities for researchers to publish their
                work in more expanded form. This special issue is a result of that initiative. For
                future installments of the conference we hope to be able to offer more general
                publication possibilities for paper contributors. This special issue draws upon some
                of the best work that was put forward at the DH Benelux 2015 Conference that was
                hosted and organized by Antwerp University.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10">Starting at the beginning, before digital humanities research can take place, the
                digitization of cultural heritage collections, often plays an important role. Yet,
                despite the increasing amount of digitized cultural heritage content being made
                available online, the accessibility of these collections remains limited. This is
                particularly due to a lack of user-friendly tools to explore such collections.
                Taking this as their starting point, and an online collection of Dutch folktales as
                their object of study, in "Supporting the Exploration of Online
                    Cultural Heritage Collections: The Case of the Dutch Folktale Database"
                Iwe Muiser and his colleagues describe how they made use of user-centred design
                approaches to develop new interfaces to facilitate the browsing and exploring of
                their collection by both folk-tale experts and members of the general public. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">Increasing the usability of digital cultural heritage collections continues in Max De
                Wilde and Simon Hengchen’s article "Semantic Enrichment of a
                    Multilingual Archive with Linked Open Data," this time with a digitized
                corpus of Belgian newspapers as the case study. In their article, they explore
                whether Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as Named Entity
                Recognition (NER) and entity-linking, can improve the search experience for end
                users of online historical collections. Addressing the particular problem of
                multilingual collections–their chosen corpus includes newspaper articles in Dutch,
                French and English–they demonstrate a language-independent method of mapping
                entities to the Linked Open Data cloud. As part of their research, they developed
                and tested MERCKX (Multilingual Entity/Resource Combiner &amp; Knowledge eXtractor),
                with the aim of enabling semantic enrichment of digital collections by small and
                medium-sized cultural heritage institutions. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">With a digitized and "cleaned" corpus there are a wide variety of
                methods that can then be applied for analysis. In "Coca-Cola: an
                    Icon of the American Way of Life. An iterative text-mining workflow for
                    analyzing advertisements in Dutch twentieth century newspapers," Melvin
                Wevers and Jesper Verhoef show an example of this by analyzing to what extent
                Coca-Cola functioned as a symbol of an American way of life within the Netherlands
                using a corpus of advertisements from the National Library of the Netherlands (KB)’s
                digitized newspaper collection. In their article, they intentionally used a
                combination of traditional and computational methods to construct a sub-corpus for
                analysis and use the corpus linguistics tool AntConc, to answer their cultural
                historical research question.</div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p13">13</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p13">Although with different research questions, J. Berenike Hermann also explores the
                multi-methodological setup of digital humanities. In her article, "In test bed with Kafka. Introducing a mixed-method approach to
                    digital stylistics," she aims at raising epistemological and
                methodological awareness within her research field of digital stylistics by using a
                practical, hands-on and ‘mixed-mode’ approach to analysing the prose of Franz Kafka.
                Using a combination of quantitative hypothesis testing, quantitative exploration and
                quantitative text analysis, she aims to pragmatically demonstrate the value of such
                an approach to her peers. While at the same time, doing justice to hermeneutic and
                empirical traditions in the field of literary stylistics. </div>
            <div class="counter"><a href="#p14">14</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p14">It seems a small step from the Kafka’s disquieting world to the world of dreams. In
                    "Unraveling reported dreams with text analytics,"
                Iris Hendrickx and her colleagues explore whether it is possible, using a
                combination of text analysis methods, including text classification, topic modelling
                and text coherence analysis, to computationally distinguish texts describing dreams
                from other personal narratives, such as diary entries. The intended goal of their
                research was to lay the foundations for innovating methods of dream analysis,
                including automatic detection of dream descriptions. </div>

                Inger Leemans <em class="emph">et al.</em>, explore how the mining of sentiments and
                emotions, can be applied to tracing the historical changes in emotional expression
                and the embodiment of emotions over time. In their article, they both present their
                Historical Embodied Emotional Model (HEEM) and reflect how it compares to other
                sentiment mining techniques using a corpus of historical Dutch theatrical texts as a
