                <p>In the emerging field of digital style analysis, scholars have been dwelling on a
                    perceived irreconcilability of "distant reading"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>] and "close reading"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#fish2012">Fish 2012</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#ransom1937">Ransom 1937</a>]. This situation is somewhat reminiscent of the
                        "paradigm wars" in social science, where for years, one
                    could either adhere to a quantitative or a qualitative mindset. Taking seriously
                    both the hermeneutic and the empirical traditions of (digital) stylistic
                    research, the present paper proposes "a mixed-methods"
                    coalition of approaches. To establish links between the mixed-methods paradigm
                    from Social Sciences [<a class="ref" href="#creswell2007">Creswell and Plano Clark 2007</a>] and stylistic practices
                    within Digital Humanities (DH), the present article discusses common methods of
                    distant, close, and ‘scalable reading’ as well as a flexibly adjustable
                    definition of style [<a class="ref" href="#herrmann2015">Herrmann et al. 2015</a>]. In the practical part of the
                    paper, I report a ‘mixed-methods digital stylistics’ study on Franz Kafka’s
                    prose. Scaling the degree of abstraction and contextuality of the data according
                    to particular research questions, I combine (1) "quantitative
                        hypothesis testing" (examining Kafka’s stylistic
                        "uniqueness" by means of a stylometric measure); (2)
                        "quantitative exploration" (analyzing the first hundred
                    statistically overrepresented words in Kafka); and (3) "qualitative
                        text analysis" (KWIC and close reading to investigate the
                    functions of a particular style marker in the context of Kafka’s <cite class="title italic">The Judgment</cite> [<cite class="title italic">Das
                    Urteil</cite>]). Generally, for digital stylistics, I propose (a) raising
                    epistemological and methodological awareness within the field, and (b) framing
                    the research within the mixed-method paradigm that in fact seems very well
                    suited to DH.</p>

                    digital stylistics, appreciating the availability of digital resources in the
                    form of data, tools, and infrastructure. The recent proliferation is visible for
                    example in monographs (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#hoover2014">Hoover et al. 2014</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2013">Jockers 2013</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#mahlberg2013">Mahlberg 2013</a>]), easy-to-access analysis tools (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#anthony2014">Anthony2014</a>]

                    [<a class="ref" href="#jockers2014">Jockers 2014</a>]), just to name a few. Contributions to the digital
                    analysis of style abound in journals such as <cite class="title italic">DH
                        Quarterly</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Digital Scholarship in the
                        Humanities </cite>(formerly <cite class="title italic">Literary and Linguistic

                        <cite class="title italic">International Journal of Corpus Linguistics</cite>.
                    Last, but not least, the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) has
                    formed the new special interested group (SIG) <cite class="title italic">Digital

                    stylistics in Digital Humanities emerging, expanding, and gradually maturing. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">However, despite these recent developments, and despite a substantial tradition
                    of digital analyses of literary style across fields (see [<a class="ref" href="#biber2011">Biber 2011</a>]

                    discipline is still in a nascent status. This can be directly linked to its
                    interdisciplinary character, with a kaleidoscope of methods, research paradigms,
                    and world views. This heterogeneity is as much a potential source of confusion
                    as well as a great asset:</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">On the one hand, the diversity may pose disadvantages. Those digital
                    stylisticians who are trained in hermeneutics see themselves confronted with
                    handling the requirements of an empirical quantitative research paradigm, with
                    issues such as standardized research designs, procedures of data sampling, and
                    analytical strategies, including statistics. Others, who come from fields based
                    around computing, such as natural language processing (NLP), computational
                    linguistics, and corpus linguistics, may be unsure what to do with the
                    deliberate open-endedness of qualitative, hermeneutic research and the important
                    role ascribed to subjectivity and context (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#vanzundert2015">van Zundert 2015</a>]).
                    Yet others may be very skeptical about the possibility of clearly defined
                    ‘methods’ for digital stylistics in the first place, because of a perceived
                    irreconcilability of numerical and hermeneutic approaches. Overall, a number of
                    reasons accounts for a perceived lack of clear methodological standards,
                    procedures and designs.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">On the other hand, the juxtaposition of hermeneutic and scientific-empirical
                    traditions provides a great potential for literary style research within DH.
                    Qualitative approaches such as literary criticism and stylistics have developed
                    a rich expertise in describing and understanding the aesthetic effects of
                    literary artifacts. Quantitative approaches such as corpus linguistics,
                    quantitative linguistics, computational linguistics, and data science generally,
                    have concentrated on exploring and explaining large-scale and general language
                    models by linguistic features. In digital stylistics, approaching aspects of
                    style from different angles – be these probabilistically obtained feature
                    patterns, predictive and descriptive accounts of quantitative style
                    distributions, or in-depth interpretations of stylistic phenomena in particular
                    textual contexts – opens up a truly multi-methodological research panorama.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In fact, digital stylistics, with its many branches and predecessors, has seen
                    method-mixing for a long time (see, e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#biber1988">Biber 1988</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#burrows1987">Burrows 1987</a>]

                    [<a class="ref" href="#spitzer1961">Spitzer 1961</a>]). Yet, we are presently dwelling on a perceived
                    irreconcilability of a form of "distant reading"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>] on the one hand, and "close
                        reading"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#ransom1937">Ransom 1937</a>] in a more aesthetically oriented variety [<a class="ref" href="#fish2012">Fish 2012</a>] on the other. Where distant reading applies aggregating
                    measures that are designed to produce quantitative evidence with statistical
                    backup, hermeneutic reading maintains a more qualitative relationship with
                    (whole) texts, explicitly calling for open-ended and subjective dimensions of
                    interpretation. Between these two "paradigms", many see close
                    reading as "old-fashioned" for being anecdotal, overly
                    subjective, or uncontrolled, whereas to others, distant reading appears
                        "perilous" for being reductionist, deterministic, or
                    neo-/postpositivist. This situation is reminiscent of the "paradigm
                        wars" in social science, where for years, one could either adhere
                    to a quantitative or a qualitative mindset (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#creswell2014">Creswell 2014</a>]

                    that enables scholars to choose particular research designs by their particular
                    objectives. Seen from the perspective of an emerging discipline of digital
                    stylistics, the challenge is now to provide a common framework for the disparate
                    approaches to stylistic inquiry. This includes a transparent and systematic
                    overview of the different approaches and methods actually employed, as well as a

                    between. In my view, this data-size-driven reading of the term is overly
                    simplistic. Rather, the emphasis should lie not so much on the scale in terms of

                        process</em>. "Scaling" here means complementing one
                    methodology with another, compensating for weaknesses of each approach, and
                    building on the combined strengths. Mueller, in an analogy of using Google
                    earth, describes the essence of scalable reading as to "zoom in and out of things and discover that different
                            properties of phenomena are revealed by looking at them from different

                    states that the tension "between algorithmic analysis and hermeneutic close
                        reading should not be overstated", since their relation is often "configured not so much as an opposition but as a

                    of stylistic similarity (e.g., using Burrows’s Delta; [<a class="ref" href="#burrows2002">Burrows 2002</a>]). This kind of analysis operates on the basis of (standardized) measures of

                    scrutinize a particular period for its style, disambiguating an "author
                        effect" from other (hidden) kinds of effects, such as
                        "genre", and "time." To this aim, a

                    the "strength of the stylistic signal" currently probably
                    comes closest to the core of the prototypical quantitative paradigm, ruling out
                    confounding factors and establishing clear cause-effect relationships (here, the

                    ones are stylistically more similar to a written mode of communication, even in
                    their "spoken passages"

                    answer to a specific hypothesis, but is a valid one. Similarly, the growing
                    number of NLP-adaptations to the literary domain (including neural networks,

                        managing modality. However, even though this analysis tackles style at the

                            observed for Kafka’s texts; (b) the observed Kafka-cluster shows
                            distances from other (potential) clusters that are greater than any
                            other distances observed.</li><li class="item">H0: Kafka’s texts <em class="emph">do not show a greater similarity to each

                            Kafka’s texts do not cluster with each other. However, as authorship is
                            a strong predictor of style, clustering by author is generally

                            groups of texts by comparison. In the cluster analysis, any

                        distinct authors (thereby demonstrating style similarity), most pronouncedly
                        the two main branches in the lower half (both with subbranches of more than
                        seven authors), as well as two smaller branches each joining two authors
                        (Keller/Goethe and May/Achleitner). Most of Kafka’s direct contemporaries
                        are thus joined by the big branch at the lower left (Bonsels, Wassermann,
                        Falke, Hesse, Mann, Schnitzler), while the branch at the lower right suggest
                        similarities between older texts (Goethe, Brentano, Arnim, Hoffmann) and the

                        furthering the stylistic research into Kafka’s prose: It is common ground in
                        literary studies that Kafka achieved the commonly attested "refusal
                            of making sense" ("Sinnverweigerung"),"with the
                            techniques of the European tradition of narration" ("mit den
                            Mitteln der europäischen Erzähltradition"). In Fig. 3 and 4 this tradition appears to show itself in
                        the form of the nearest neighbors, all of which allegedly use a
                            "realistic" writing style (with a great amount of
                        concrete detail and vividly rendered descriptions, as well as dialogue).
                        Further study needs to establish whether there really is a stylistic
                        similarity with these authors (and among them), and, if so, what features
                        contribute. What is more, Kafka research has shown that he liked reading
                        books for younger readers, as well as (popular) adventure literature and
                        journey descriptions in general (e.g., [<a class="ref" href="#blank2001">Blank 2001</a>]). There is

                        (modal) verbs from the analysis. The observed types (e.g., <span class="foreign i">aber, nicht, allerdings, vielleicht, schon, ja,
                            auch</span>) are semantically very flexible, potentially exerting
                        distinct functions across different co(n)texts, e.g., to manage
                        doubt/certainty, limit/broaden scope of assertions, and for

                        not communicate on the basis of a reliable common ground. Instead, there are
                        constant shifts in basic beliefs, and thus, in part due to the use of modal
                        particles (or accompanied by them as symptoms of underlying communicative
                        shortcomings) the management of information fails epically, resulting in the
                        death of the son. In particular, <span class="foreign i">ja</span> is
                        normally used to signal that interlocutor A assumes that interlocutor B
                        maintains a shared knowledge/belief at the present point in time; <span class="foreign i">doch</span> is normally used to signal that
                        interlocutor A assumes that interlocutor B is presently not aware of an
                        allegedly shared knowledge/belief. However, in <cite class="title italic">The
                            Judgment</cite>, the characters often use them in an infelicitous way,
                        not respecting conventional pragmatic principles. The fact that in terms of
                        frequency, the modal particles in Kafka’s fictional narrative roughly equal
                        the natural distribution in spoken language may explain the overuse
                        identified in the keyness analysis, especially when assuming that modal
                        particles are overall not as frequent in fictional writing. Speculatively,
                        one may adopt the idea that the use of <span class="foreign i">ja</span>
                        and <span class="foreign i">doch</span> in <cite class="title italic">The
                            Judgment</cite> is typical for Kafka’s use of modal particles in
                        general, especially taking into account that modal particles are indicators
                        of free indirect discourse, which is one of the properties frequently
                        assigned to Kafka’s prose. </div>

                        out and test these hypotheses. For now, it may be stated that the use of two
                        specific modal particles indeed seems to contribute to the "elevated
                            everyday language" described as typical of Kafka’s style (in <cite class="title italic">Metamorphosis</cite>, cf. [<a class="ref" href="#trost2008">Trost 2008</a>]).
                        The examination of two modal particles in one particular text used the local

                        complex social-communicative relations. Since modal particles are heavily
                        dependent on contextual analysis, both levels are essential when striving to
                        make well-informed statements about their function in Kafka’s style. </div>

                        they approached Kafka’s style – quantitatively and qualitatively,
                        explanatory and exploratory, deductively and inductively, and also in the
                        degree of speculation and interpretative freedom licensed. With regard to
                        quantitative analysis, I have highlighted that hypothesis testing in the

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">Above, I first proposed that the interdisciplinary setup of DH stylistics has
                    advantages and disadvantages, depending on how we handle the issue, and that in
                    fact, DH style studies may be a natural environment for the mixed-methods
                    paradigm. To contextualize this, I have reported on my own research, assuming
                    that in terms of its general character, it may be quite representative of
                    digital text analysis, even though the range of methods and questions found in
                    DH stylistics is naturally much wider. For reasons of focus, further crucial
                    dimensions of doing DH stylistics that relate to research design have not been
                    mentioned, such as programming, sample selection, edition and publication. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">I pointed out that in some moments, in line with a ‘quantitative paradigm’, we
                    may strive for open questions to be settled, and possibilities for
                    interpretation of results to be delimited in order to achieve significant and
                    replicable results. At other points of the research process, we may tap into the
                        "qualitative paradigm", in line with our hermeneutic
                    tradition, allowing higher degrees of (aesthetic) subjectivity, generating
                    ideas, and opening discussion of alleged securities. Pointing towards a
                        "mixed-methods paradigm", I would now like to conclude by
                    considering Moretti’s take on distant reading: <blockquote><p>
                        If we want to understand the system in its entirety, we
                            must accept losing something. We always pay a price for theoretical
                            knowledge: reality is infinitely rich; concepts are abstract, are poor.
                            But it’s precisely this ‘poverty’ that makes it possible to handle them,
                            and therefore to know. This is why less is actually more.
                         [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2000">Moretti 2000</a>, 578–8]
                    </p></blockquote> My point in this paper has been to embrace distant reading's
                    variable-driven principle, but to complement it by a paradigm that is
                    case-driven, looks at smaller samples, and may indulge in open-ended
                    interpretation about connections between different variables. Both general
                    approaches have their merit, and tapping into the methodological flexibility
                    offered by a mixed-methods paradigm will allow for the interaction of different
                    mindsets in a structured way. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p51">51</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p51"> By mutual methods critique, we may more vigorously utilize the meaning potential
                    of crunched numbers, as well as sharpen hermeneutically obtained insight to a

                        mixed-methods is essentially an empirical research paradigm. This is
                        compatible with a digital stylistics that understands
                            "empirical" in the wide sense – as the
                            "acquisition of knowledge through observation"
                        (“Wissensgewinn durch Beobachtung”) [<a class="ref" href="#eibl2013">Eibl 2013</a>, 23].</div><div class="endnote" id="d21014e438"><span class="noteRef">[2]</span> This may possibly even entail striving for some unifying
                        epistemological perspective. Some mixed-methods scholars advocate
                        pragmatism, such as Creswell who assumes a strong link between
                            "worldviews" (e.g., postpositivist, social
                        constructivist, participatory, pragmatic) and research methods [<a class="ref" href="#creswell2014">Creswell 2014</a>]. Others, such as Kelle describe weaker links
                        between particular world views and methods [<a class="ref" href="#kelle2008">Kelle 2008</a>].</div><div class="endnote" id="d21014e529"><span class="noteRef">[3]</span> Within mixed-method approaches, interpretation is being
                        recognized as a vital operation, linked to the tradition of hermeneutic
                        inquiry: "data analysis, including quantitative data
                                analysis, is a process of interpretation involving basic hermeneutic
                                principles"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#ness2011">Ness et al. 2011</a>, 294]. Good mixed-methods research in DH stylistics should fulfill criteria
                        that allow for complementariness (cf. [<a class="ref" href="#miles2014">Miles et al. 2014</a>, 311–314]) – and methodological awareness. If such criteria are met, subjectivity
                        and phases of open-ended interpretation are highly justified. These become
                        problematic only where introspection and impressionistic observations are
                        used in an opaque way, which however is true for any quantitative-scientific
                        study as well [<a class="ref" href="#rudman2016">Rudman 2016</a>]. Problematic is also a dogmatic
                        rejection of (aggregated) "data". Indispensable practical
                        factors of sound mixed-method research are clear language use and the
                        definition of concepts and terms.</div><div class="endnote" id="d21014e744"><span class="noteRef">[4]</span> Recently, scholars like
                            Symonds &amp; Gorard have emphasized that a distinction between
                                "quantitative" and
                                "qualitative" research is a stereotypical
                            idealization [<a class="ref" href="#symonds2010">Symonds and Gorard 2010</a>]. As such, it indeed helps
                            structuring our understanding of practices. However, it may be
                            misleading to use a dichotomy as a basis for invoking a mixed-methods
                            paradigm, since research processes ‘in the wild’ are not necessarily
                            paradigmatic. Rather, they lie on a continuum between
                                    <em class="emph">"open-endedness" vs.
                                    "closed-endedness"</em> (data collection

                                    <em class="emph">"interpretation of natural occurring
                                    data" vs.

                            (analytical techniques). A gradual character of
                            quantification/qualification is actually evident in digital stylistics:
                            there are many quantitative studies that aim at exploration, rather than
                            at explanation through hypothesis testing (e.g., data science in the
                            sense of [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2015">Manovich 2015</a>]). At the same time, close reading
                            can be used to test hypotheses derived from statistical quantitative
                            analyses (e.g., revealing what mode of thought representation is
                            actually invoked by a certain verb type that contributes significantly
                            to a factor analysis of genre style). However, I believe that working
                            with research paradigms has a useful structuring function and therefore

                        and will thus not be discussed in depth. His key argument is that the basic
                        distinction of what he calls "distant reading" from other
                        forms of literary criticism is "the practice of framing historical inquiry
                            as an experiment, using hypotheses and samples (of texts or other social
                            evidence) that are defined before the writer settles on a
                            conclusion." (5). He thus draws a basic distinction between
                        exploratory ("other forms of literary criticism") and
                        explanatory ("distant reading") inquiry. Although, as
                        explained above, I see a great value in mapping the distinction of
                            "distant vs. other forms of reading" onto the basic
                            "quantitative vs. qualitative" paradigms, I do not
                        fully agree with Underwood’s general characterization of “distant reading”
                        as an "experimental" hypothesis-testing endeavor. There
                        is, after all, a great number of "distant
                        reading"-studies that uses data aggregation methods and big data
                        sets to explore (emerging) patterns. Such studies, which are fully valid, as

                        proclaiming that with the large available repositories of data, the nature
                        of numerically transformable data is fundamentally changing: instead of
                            "long data", which is (traditionally) organized in
                        few variables with many pertaining cases, the new type is "wide
                            data", clustered in many variables with a huge amount of
                        individual cases [<a class="ref" href="#manovich2015">Manovich 2015</a>]. In "data
                            mining", data exploration techniques incl. dimension reduction
                        are most important for predictive analysis and machine learning based on
                        probabilities of correlations. While correlative/association analyses have
                        long been established in computational and corpus linguistics (as in social
                        sciences), "big data science" appears in a new quality.
                        In its most prominent formulation it forsakes the quest for causality (and
                            "theory") altogether [<a class="ref" href="#anderson2008">Anderson 2008</a>].
                        Seen from the perspective of mixed-methods, however, there is no reason for
                        why one should not include stages of zooming in on causal
                        relationships.</div><div class="endnote" id="d21014e1103"><span class="noteRef">[10]</span> As will be seen below, this is a somewhat loose
                            understanding of hypothesis testing. Explanatory hypothesis testing in
                            the strict quantitative sense would have selected a combination of
                            hypothesis and method that leaves much less room for confounding
                            variables. The particular analysis is thus a typical example for the
                            current state of the field, pending more rigorous and wide-spread
                            applications of hypothesis testing.</div><div class="endnote" id="d21014e1223"><span class="noteRef">[11]</span> It is an open (empirical) question how much of this effect of

                            it is a matter of "plot". Since both dimensions tend
                            to feed into each other, further research is needed to creatively
                            establish ways of description and measurement.</div><div class="endnote" id="d21014e1261"><span class="noteRef">[12]</span>

                            diverse genres). Comparison shows very similar results for Kafka (N=24
