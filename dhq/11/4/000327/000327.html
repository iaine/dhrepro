                <p>This paper demonstrates the use of a user-centred design approach for the
                    development of generous interfaces/rich prospect browsers for an online cultural
                    heritage collection, determining its primary user groups and designing different
                    browsing tools to cater to their specific needs. We set out to solve a set of
                    problems faced by many online cultural heritage collections. These problems are
                    lack of accessibility, limited functionalities to explore the collection through
                    browsing, and risk of less known content being overlooked. The object of our
                    study is the Dutch Folktale Database, an online collection of tens of thousands
                    of folktales from the Netherlands. Although this collection was designed as a
                    research commodity for folktale experts, its primary user group consists of
                    casual users from the general public. We present the new interfaces we developed
                    to facilitate browsing and exploration of the collection by both folktale
                    experts and casual users. We focus on the user-centred design approach we
                    adopted to develop interfaces that would fit the users' needs and
                    preferences.</p>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Over the past few decades, an ever-growing amount of cultural heritage
                    collections has been digitised and made available online. In principle, the
                    materials in these collections are now available to larger audiences than ever
                    before. In practice, the accessibility of many online collections is limited by
                    the absence of easy, user-friendly ways to explore the collection and get an
                    overview of their contents [<a class="ref" href="#ruecker2011">Ruecker et al. 2011</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2015">Whitelaw 2015</a>]. This may result in users accessing only materials
                    they already know or expect to be in the collection, while unknown items remain
                    hidden. Finally, accessibility for the general public will be reduced if a
                    collection is presented mainly from an expert perspective [<a class="ref" href="#trant2006">Trant 2006</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Whitelaw proposes to improve accessibility of online collections by designing
                    so-called generous interfaces, "rich, browsable interfaces that reveal the
                        scale and complexity of digital heritage collections" by allowing the
                    whole content of a database to be accessed from a single starting point [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2015">Whitelaw 2015</a>]. This is a similar solution to the rich-prospect
                    browsers proposed by Ruecker et al., which show "a visual representation of every item in a given
                            collection, combined with tools for manipulating the display"

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Folktales have been an important aspect of culture for as long as we can trace
                    back in history. Jokes, legends, fairy tales, etcetera have been conceived, told
                    and retold over time. For considerably less time, they have also been documented
                    in manuscripts, documents, books, and catalogues. In 1994 a database containing
                    folktales collected in The Netherlands was established at the Meertens Institute
                    in Amsterdam and was baptised the Dutch Folktale Database. It has been extended
                    with new folktales and subcollections ever since. The first version was a local
                    database, only available to researchers within the institute, but in 2004 the
                    database became available online. At the moment of writing the Dutch Folktale
                    Database contains roughly 44.200 folktales from all over the Netherlands, in
                    several languages (mostly Dutch and Frisian) as well as numerous dialects and
                    historical versions of Dutch. They have been collected by 1477 collectors and
                    cover almost a thousand years, with the oldest folktales dating back to the 12th
                    Century. The folktales have been annotated with an abundant amount of metadata
                    related to the story content such as summary, keywords, motifs and folktale
                    type, as well as metadata related to the storytelling situation such as
                    geolocation, narrator, collector, corpus, and source. These rich annotations
                    make the database very useful as a resource for research, on top of its evident
                    archival function.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">The Dutch Folktale Database is a good illustration of the accessibility problems
                    of online cultural heritage collections sketched above. Its original search
                    options demanded a fair amount of knowledge about the contents of the
                    collection, and were not suitable for casual users. Stories of interest could

                    is a preferred information seeking method for people working with folktales [<a class="ref" href="#labarre2012">La Barre and Tilley 2012</a>], possibilities for browsing the collection were very
                    limited. At the same time, the size, variability and growth of content made it
                    difficult for its users to have an overview of the collection.</div>

                    have been developed that are expected to further speed up the growth of the

                    already present in the database have been cleaned up and standardised [<a class="ref" href="#muiser2012">Muiser et al. 2012</a>], improving the possibilities to search, categorise
                    and compare them. Some faulty or missing data however, cannot be corrected or
                    retrieved. Folktales may have been narrated by an anonymous person, or annotated
                    without a date or location. This can make them difficult to access, as they may
                    be pushed to the back, or even left out, of search results. By providing users
                    with the opportunity to browse and explore the collection from many different
                    angles, we hope to enable more "accidental" discovery of also

                    [<a class="ref" href="#preece2015">Preece et al. 2015</a>]. Therefore, before deciding on the direction to take
                    for the development of new interfaces for the Dutch Folktale Database, an
                    analysis of how it is being used and who is using it was necessary. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11">As a first step, we conducted a short poll among the website visitors of the
                    Dutch Folktale Database, asking them for which purpose they wanted to use the
                    information from the database. The seven answer options can be seen in Table 1.
                    The poll was similar to a survey on an earlier version of the website [<a class="ref" href="#trieschnigg2013a">Trieschnigg et al. 2013a</a>], except that we added one answer option
                        ("For a school assignment") because this purpose was
                    often entered in the "other" field of the earlier survey. In
                    our poll, users could choose only one answer whereas in the survey of
                    Trieschnigg et al., more than one answer could be selected.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12">The poll ran for around 3 weeks in the spring of 2015 and was filled in by 226
                    users of the Dutch Folktale Database. In Table 1 we can see that most people
                    visited the website for personal use (73.5%). This number has increased since
                    the earlier poll, of which the results are also shown in Table 1 for comparison.
                    A possible explanation is that since the beginning of 2013, the Dutch Folktale
                    Database uses a new content management system called Omeka (<a class="ref" href="http://omeka.org/" onclick="window.open('http://omeka.org/'); return false">http://omeka.org/</a>). Omeka makes the website
                    rank higher in the results of search engines, thereby likely attracting more
                    casual visitors.</div>

                    to collect visitor data between Feb-June 2015. Google Analytics is a platform
                    that provides a large amount of statistics about websites. It allows for a
                    detailed analysis of the behaviour of the users, including click-through paths. </div>

                    received about 350-400 individual users per day, in about 400-450 sessions. They
                    were quite evenly distributed over five age groups (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54,
                    55-64, 65+) with percentages between 15% and 20%. Almost nine out of ten
                    visitors (88%) had never visited the website before. The remaining 12% were
                        "tagged" by Google Analytics as a returning visitor,
                    meaning a visitor who started a new session after having closed all pages of the
                    website. Whether users return can give us an indication of whether the user
                    experience on a site is adequate. The amount of time a user spends on the site
                    is also an indicator [<a class="ref" href="#khoo2008">Khoo et al. 2008</a>]. We found that the average
                    session duration was only 1:20 minutes, which seems rather short and suggests
                    that there was insufficient incentive for users to remain on the site and
                    explore further. Users visited an average of 2.03 pages per session. This is an
                    important metric, as it indicates how willing users were to explore more
                    folktales. The low number may have been due to the lack of an easy way for users
                    to explore the collection. </div>

                    to the full text of a folktale. Therefore, one explanation for the short time
                    users spent on the site may be that many users immediately found what they were
                    looking for. However, we would like to tempt these users to explore other
                    folktales as well. </div>

                    they used the database for professional purposes (storytelling, education,

                    for searching and browsing the Dutch Folktale Database were limited to using a
                    simple Google-style search box located in the top right corner of each page, or
                    browsing through an alphabetical list of lexicon entries linked to stories.
                    After entering a search word or phrase in the search box, the user was provided
                    with a list of search results. There were no options for filtering the results;
                    the list could only be changed by changing the search phrase or by using the
                        "advanced search" option, which confronts the user with a
                    large list of search fields corresponding to folktale metadata, see Figure 1.
                    However, as we will discuss in more detail below, most of these advanced search
                    fields are only meaningful or relevant for folktale experts, not for casual
                    users. Moreover, the desired values needed to be typed manually into these

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">The map tool supports selecting subsets of folktale data based on search
                        queries. It visualises the folktales on a map in combination with a timeline
                        (see Figure 2). This dynamic visualisation utilises a faceted navigation
                        technique [<a class="ref" href="#english2002">English 2002</a>], which can be used to obtain subsets
                        of folktales meeting specific selection criteria and narrow down on
                        folktales of interest. The facets are shown as pie charts on the right side
                        of the interface (see Figure 2) and can be clicked to update the results on
                        the map. The facets are updated as well to show the contents of the subset.
                        The visualisation starts with a full dataset overview from which cross
                        sections can be made. At the moment, the tool only visualises the locations
                        where the folktales were narrated and not, for example, the locations
                        mentioned in the folktales. Still, the completeness of overview of the
                        collection and therefore the accessibility of all corners of the collection
                        is apparent.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">The interface relies on shapes and colours to represent several properties of
                        the data. A circle on the map represents a location where at least one
                        folktale was narrated. The size of a circle represents the number of tales
                        in a location. Transparency can be set for the circles to create an effect
                        similar to a heat map, which can give a clear picture of the concentration
                        of folktales in certain areas. To make individual circles more noticeable,
                        they can all be made the same size. This way, small circles will not be
                        hidden behind large ones. Folktales that have not been annotated with a
                        location are currently shown in the North Sea; this is a temporary solution
                        to keep them from being overlooked. </div>

                        international cooperation between folklore researchers by linking their
                        national collections, as advocated by Meder [<a class="ref" href="#meder2010">Meder 2010</a>]. Due
                        to various factors such as ownership, differences in metadata and opinions
                        about content, it is very hard to establish a single international database
                        of folktales. It seems more feasible to let folktale databases exist in
                        their own context, and promote the "donation" of content
                        to a central system. A logical assumption that can be made about folktales
                        is that, with the exception of Internet based tales, they were recorded at a
                        certain time and place. This means that all folktale collections are
                        expected to contain at least time and place as metadata, which makes a
                        map-based interface very suitable as a collective interface. </div>

                        searching for the origins, kinship, variability and stability of tales [<a class="ref" href="#tehrani2013">Tehrani 2013</a>]. However, most empirical investigations of
                        narrative similarity have only been carried out on a small scale so far [<a class="ref" href="#nguyen2014">Nguyen et al. 2014</a>]. In our visualisation tool, the similarity of
                        large numbers of folktales can be determined based on different
                        configurations of metadata such as folktale type, keywords, named entities,
                        word count, genre, etcetera. This comparison yields a score that can be used
                        to determine their degree of similarity. In line with Abello et al., our
                        system visualises the similarity between tales as a dynamic network graph
                        (see Figure 3) [<a class="ref" href="#abello2012">Abello et al. 2012</a>]. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29">The tool can be used from different starting points. A single folktale can be
                        loaded to which neighbours, folktales with similar metadata, can be added.
                        These neighbours can subsequently be interconnected and added upon as well.
                        This way, an entire network can be built up from a single item. Another
                        starting point is to do a keyword search to obtain multiple folktales as
                        nodes. These can then be interconnected and added upon as well. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30">Once a network has been built, it is possible to start exploring grouped
                        nodes and links by clicking on them. There is also a possibility to select
                        multiple nodes to show the composition of this subset, using the same pie
                        chart shaped facets as are available in the map tool. By doing so, the user
                        is invited to find new perspectives to compare folktale stories. The tool
                        gives the user the freedom to hypothesise and test which metadata fields are
                        valuable to compare in order to gain new insights into the relations between
                        folktales, and how these relations evolved over place and time. It could be
                        used to verify existing theories and classifications that have been based on
                        qualitative research. For instance, when connecting folktale nodes purely
                        based on keywords, we found that clusters are formed that show good overlap
                        with the frequently used Aarne-Thompson-Uther (ATU) folktale type-index [<a class="ref" href="#uther2004">Uther 2004</a>]. In other tests with the network tool, users have
                        already reported finding unexpected connections between tales. This is
                        because the tool connects texts outside traditional classification systems
                        that experts commonly use, such as ATU. These early findings suggest that in
                        the future, the tool may open up new avenues for folktale research that go
                        beyond what was previously possible. </div>

                        on functionality. Thorough user evaluations with expert users still need to
                        be carried out to investigate the usability of both interfaces, similar to

                    Database. As shown by our user polls, the large majority of its visitors are
                    interested in the collection for personal use. To accommodate this user group,
                    we adopted a user-centred approach to design two search and browsing interfaces
                    for casual users. We built these interfaces using the same software as used for
                    the expert visualisation tools discussed in the previous sections, but in their
                    design we focused on simplicity and usability. Unlike folktale researchers, who
                    are strongly motivated to use the collection and are less likely to be
                    discouraged by usability problems, casual users will quickly abandon the site if
                    their experience with it is not good. Our analysis of the use of the Dutch
                    Folktale Database made it clear that visitors need to be encouraged to spend
                    more time on the site, discover more content and come back for more.</div>

                        search box. As noted by Whitelaw, the trouble with this is that it requires
                        a query from the user, even though many users are not seeking specific
                        information [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2015">Whitelaw 2015</a>]. Our goal was therefore to design
                        a new search interface that would allow the users to make use of metadata to
                        search the collection, like in the advanced search (see Figure 1), but with
                        an easy-to-use faceted search interface instead of a list of search fields.
                        Such an interface should provide the users with a good overview of the
                        collection and of the different dimensions it can be searched or browsed on.
                        We expected this type of interaction with the collection to be intuitive, as
                        most users will already be familiar with faceted search interfaces from
                        popular web shops such as Amazon. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">Our first step was to investigate which of the folktales’ metadata were of
                        interest to casual users, as opposed to domain experts. To this end we
                        recruited a test group of 9 potential users and presented them with a list
                        of metadata that could potentially serve as facets. We asked the
                        participants to indicate for each potential facet whether they would want it
                        to be included in the search interface. The ages of the participants (4
                        male, 5 female) ranged from 21 to 78 years, with an average age of 43 years.
                        This resembles the age distribution of the visitors of the Dutch Folktale
                        Database. Of the participants, two were scouting leaders and one was a
                        teacher on a primary school; these are the kinds of casual users that would
                        occasionally visit the Dutch Folktale Database looking for stories to tell
                        by the campfire or at school. None of the participants were familiar with

                        alternative designs and presented them to six of the participants who had
                        judged the potential facets. In our design choices we mainly focused on
                        various options to present the facets, e.g., listing selected facets next to
                        each other or below each other; showing selected facets together with
                        non-selected facets, or in a separate section; showing all possible values
                        of each facet or only the most frequent ones, etcetera. Based on the users’
                        preferences, we created the final design shown in Figure 5. Selected facets
                        are shown below the main search box, but also among the non-selected facets
                        in the menu on the left. The list of shown values for each facet is limited
                        to a maximum of the eight most frequent ones, but users can fold open the
                        list for more values. After each value, the number of matching items in the
                        current result list is shown. When no search terms have been entered and no
                        facets have been selected, the numbers for all items in the database are
                        shown, giving the user an overview of the entire collection. The new search
                        interface was implemented using an Omeka plugin called SolrSearch, which
                        implements SOLR to become the primary search engine on Omeka-based sites.
                        SolrSearch was made by researchers of the ScholarsLab of the University of
                        Virginia (<a class="ref" href="https://github.com/scholarslab/SolrSearch" onclick="window.open('https://github.com/scholarslab/SolrSearch'); return false">https://github.com/scholarslab/SolrSearch</a>). </div>

                        of the Standard Usability Test (SUS) [<a class="ref" href="#brooke1996">Brooke 1996</a>]. In this
                        test, participants indicate their level of agreement with ten statements on
                        a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. Example statements include, "I found
                            the system unnecessarily complex" and "I thought the system was
                            easy to use". The new design was tested by nine participants
                        recruited from a public library. We expected library visitors to be more
                        likely than the average person to have an interest in folktales, and thus to
                        more be representative of our target group of causal users. To compare the
                        usability of the new search interface with that of the old version, we also
                        tested the old search interface. The test of the old version involved a
                        total of 14 participants: five library visitors, eight bachelor students
                        from our university (study programme: Creative Technology), and one actual
                        visitor of the Dutch Folktale Database who reacted to a call for
                        participants on the website. None of the participants had used either of the
                        tested interfaces before. </div>

                        after which they filled in the SUS questionnaire.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">The results of the SUS test are calculated as described by Brooke [<a class="ref" href="#brooke1996">Brooke 1996</a>]. A total SUS score of 68 (out of 100) is seen as
                        average. In our test, the old search interface received a SUS score of
                        60.89, which is below average (Figure 6: SUS score V1). The new faceted
                        design received a SUS score of 81.39, which is well above average (Figure 6:
                        SUS score V2). We can conclude that the new design is a marked improvement
                        over the old search interface. However, a few critical remarks are in order.
                        First, those who tested the new search interface were more evenly
                        distributed in age than those testing the old version, which did not include
                        the age groups 25-34 and 35-44. Second, the students who tested the old
                        search interface might have been more critical of it due to their academic
                        background, and less interested in the contents of the Folktale Database.
                        This may have resulted in a lower SUS score for the old search interface
                        than would have been given by users who were more representative of the
                        target group. Still, Figure 6 shows similar trend lines for both interfaces,
                        so we feel it is safe to say that the overall usability of the new search
                        interface is higher than that of the old version.</div>

                        interactive map in the future. Therefore we created a second interface,
                        based on the map tool for folktale researchers that was described earlier in
                        this paper. We used the same technology as in the expert map tool, but
                        designed a new interface more suitable for casual users.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Given the complexity and size of the data that can be portrayed with maps,

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p43">43</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p43">These requirements can be contradicting; for instance, a minimalistic
                        interface might emphasise the database content well, but could come at the
                        cost of being unintuitive. It is hence very important to find the right
                        balance between the requirements. For this reason, we carried out numerous
                        informal user tests with different interface designs.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">The main concept was to provide a map showing folktales in the form of

                        minimal "filter buttons" corresponding to facets that can
                        be used to select subsets from the collection. Figure 7 shows the initial
                        design of the filter buttons. After clicking a filter button, the values of
                        the facet are folded out for selection or deselection by the user. The
                        folktales matching the user’s selection are shown on the map. This way, the
                        users get to see only the stories they are interested in, while still being
                        invited to explore the other folktales in the database.</div>

                        source type (e.g., book, Internet), language/dialects (e.g., standard Dutch,
                        Frisian), keywords (e.g., death, man), and tale collectors. We selected this
                        last category instead of creators/tellers, because users looked more often
                        for collectors than creators in the transaction logs analysed by [<a class="ref" href="#trieschnigg2013a">Trieschnigg et al. 2013a</a>]. We made a conscious choice to strongly
                        limit the number of facets, preferring minimalism and simplicity of the
                        interface over completeness.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">Based on informal feedback of several potential users on our initial design
                        ideas, we created a first mock-up of the interface (Figures 7 and 8) with a
                        few interaction possibilities, but no actual functionality. In a small-scale
                        user test, four people (age range 20-50, two male, two female) solved a few
                        simple tasks with the mock-up. This test showed that some of the icons we
                        used for the buttons were unclear. However, the biggest problem with the
                        interface design turned out to be the visualisation of multiple folktales at
                        the same location on the map. In the mock-up we used a bookmark metaphor for
                        this, using tabs to indicate multiple folktales per location (Figure 8). The
                        test showed that users did not notice these tabs very quickly, and when they
                        did, it was not clear to them that the tabs correlated with multiple
                        folktales. In our final interface design, shown in Figure 9, we therefore
                        used a fundamentally different solution, indicated by (4) in the figure. The
                        folktales are now shown as individual bubbles, placed in a circle around
                        their location. The subgenre of each folktale is indicated by an icon within
                        its bubble. The same icons are also used in the fold-out menu of the
                        subgenre filter button. This provides users with an instant indication of
                        the kinds of stories that are available per location. If the number of
                        folktales per location exceeds the number that can be presented in the
                        circle, a "More" button is included in the circle. When
                        clicked, it shows the next set of folktales at that location. This new
                        circle includes a back button to return to the previous set, and another
                            "More" button if even more folktales are
                        available.</div>

                        of the interface (2) we added a switch between the map interface (<span class="foreign i">Verhalenkaart</span> in Dutch) and the regular
                        interface of the Dutch Folktale Database (<span class="foreign i">Verhalenbank</span>). Since we expected users to have an interest in
                        folktales at specific locations, e.g., local legends, a location search
                        feature was included. This allows users to instantly go to a specific place
                        on the map by typing in a location. We also included a "Locate

                        location to show folktales in their vicinity (3). Finally, we customised the

                        only those details which are important for finding folktales (e.g.,

                        location. After performing the tasks they were asked to fill in the
                        Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of use (USE) questionnaire [<a class="ref" href="#lund2001">Lund 2001</a>], which requires the users to indicate their level
                        of agreement with a number of statements concerning ease of use, ease of
                        learning and satisfaction on 7-point Likert scale. We also included a few
                        interface-specific statements on the effectiveness of the filter options and
                        the navigation between multiple folktales. Finally, we asked them to provide
                        feedback on the interface. The average results of the questionnaire are
                        given in Table 3. The participants were positive on all USE dimensions as
                        well as on the interface-specific statements.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">In this paper we have described our methodology for designing 'generous
                    interfaces' [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2015">Whitelaw 2015</a>] and rich-prospect browsers [<a class="ref" href="#ruecker2011">Ruecker et al. 2011</a>] for an online collection of folktales, serving two
                    main types of users with different knowledge and different information needs:
                    (1) researchers (expert users), who are interested in patterns and relations
                    between folktales, and who generally have a good understanding of what they are
                    looking for, and (2) casual users who, without browsing possibilities mostly
                    tend to search on genres or well-known fairy tales; see [<a class="ref" href="#trieschnigg2013a">Trieschnigg et al. 2013a</a>]. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53">In our design process for casual users we followed a user-centred design
                    methodology, of which the main steps can be summarized as follows. The first
                    step was to employ web analytics and surveys to find out who used the
                    collection, how they used it and why. This helped us to obtain insights into the
                    different user groups. Next, the most relevant dimensions for searching and
                    browsing the collection were determined in consultation with representatives of
                    the main user groups. We carried out usability tests of candidate designs using
                    paper prototypes and mock-ups. Based on the results, the final interface designs
                    were established, technically implemented and integrated in the website of our
                    folktale collection</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p54">A similar methodology could be applied to other projects aimed at developing user
                    interfaces for digital cultural heritage collections, and we hope our case study
                    can serve as an inspirational example. We believe that taking a user-centred
                    approach is essential for the design of interfaces that are truly
                        "generous" and accessible for different kinds of users.
                    This holds in particular for casual users: usability is an important requirement
                    for them, but their needs may be easily overlooked in the case of collections
                    that, like the Dutch Folktale Database, were originally set up with scholarly
                    use in mind. Not all similar projects need to follow exactly the same steps as
                    ours; however, we believe that (1) getting to know the users and their needs and
                    (2) testing interface design choices with representative users before
                    implementing them are essential steps in any interface design process. Even when
                    done on a small scale and with limited resources, these steps can provide
                    valuable insights.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55">Our project resulted in several flexible exploration tools and interfaces that
                    exploit the rich metadata in the Dutch Folktale Database for use in faceted
                    search and browsing. The interfaces provide a bird’s-eye view of the collection,
                    allowing both casual users and experts to find useful perspectives on the data.
                    We expect this will encourage casual users to discover more of our national
                    cultural heritage, and help researchers to answer both old and new research
                    questions on a larger scale than was previously possible. In the last decades a
                    number of national folktale database initiatives have been launched in different
                    countries. Our tools can form the basis for an online platform for future
                    cooperation and international data sharing between these folktale databases,
                    making these treasure troves of oral culture accessible to scholars and
                    non-scholars alike. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p56">The newly developed interfaces have been integrated into the website of the Dutch
                    Folktale Database. The next step is to determine whether this indeed has the
                    intended effect of retaining casual users for a longer period of time,
                    encouraging them to explore more folktales, and having them return more often to
                    the website. To this end, a new round of user data collection needs to be done
                    using Google Analytics, and the results need to be compared to our earlier
                    findings. However, this remains as future work. Also future work is an analysis
                    to investigate whether the new interfaces indeed lead to be more unique content
                    being accessed. A comparison of folktale documents by a combination of keywords,
                    subgenre, subject, motifs etcetera showed that about 5% of all documents have no
                    direct neighbours in the collection. These folktales will not show up in the
                    network visualisation currently employed on the website, but they can be exposed
                    via the faceted browsing and map-based interfaces. It remains to be seen whether
                    this is sufficient, or if more needs to be done to facilitate discovery of these
                    items.</div>
