                <p>This paper analyzes the design space for crafting systems within games. A
                    crafting system is the collection of game mechanics which enable a player to
                    create virtual objects within a game, with examples ranging from making a
                    pickaxe or placing blocks in <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite>, to
                    combining ingredients to create items in <cite class="title italic">World of
                        Warcraft</cite>, or designing a city in <cite class="title italic">SimCity</cite>. Within both game design and game journalism there is no
                    systematic understanding of what crafting means in games—rather, the term is
                    used in an informal "I’ll know it when I see it" way, with
                    different ideas of what constitutes "crafting" becoming
                    conventional for different game genres. We aim to create a more systematic
                    analysis and language for virtual crafting, using a design space approach where
                    we identify seven features of crafting systems; any given crafting system is
                    understood in terms of the degree and manner in which it exemplifies these
                    features. The features we identify are: recipe definition (how well-defined are
                    the player steps for creating a virtual object), fidelity of action (how
                    detailed is the player-performed enactment of crafting), completion constraints
                    (how is creation constrained by virtual "resources"),
                    variable outcome (how much can the result vary when the player performs the same
                    crafting actions), system recognition of outcome (to what degree do other game
                    systems "understand" and take account of what a player has
                    made), player expressiveness (how big is the creative space provided to the
                    player), and progression (how do the possibilities of crafting change over
                    time). We apply these dimensions to the analysis of 64 crafting systems across
                    47 example games. This more systematic analysis of the crafting system design
                    space provides a deeper understanding of how games function as a creative and
                    artistic medium for players, and provides a language and framework enabling
                    scholars, critics and developers to more deeply understand existing crafting
                    systems as well as unexplored opportunities for future crafting systems.</p>

                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Crafting in games affords a unique kind of interactive experience, only possible
                    in playable media, and made increasingly rich with the complex computational
                    modeling of videogames<a class="noteRef" href="#d18523e302">[1]</a>. It enables
                    players to create items and structures without the cost, effort, and destructive
                    modification of raw materials in the real world. It provides spaces of playful
                    experimentation and creative expression, wherein ordinary people can design and
                    create whole buildings, cities, geographies, machines, rocketships, gardens, and
                    creatures, without a difficult-to-acquire formal education, specialized
                    knowledge, or extraordinary resources. Games provide a context of playfulness
                    that removes the inhibiting pressure to make something perfect or to fulfill a
                    practical purpose. Crafting in games often supports creativity as intrinsically
                    pleasurable, rather than as a commodified, extrinsically-motivated way to
                    accomplish tasks, much like the casual creators genre identified by Compton and
                    Mateas [<a class="ref" href="#compton2015">Compton 2015</a>]. It also means that people can create things
                    that would be altogether impossible in the real world. These creations then
                    exist in the context of a game world; what players craft in a game becomes part
                    of the game, taking on a new life, whether becoming part of a graphically
                    modeled, physically simulated landscape, or an item that the player-character
                    can use, wear, trade, or consume. This is all to say that crafting in games,
                    while sharing much in common with real-world crafting or digitally augmented
                        crafting<a class="noteRef" href="#d18523e307">[2]</a>, is also made significantly different by its
                    context in playable systems. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Crafting is a creative and pleasurable alternative gaming experience—thus often
                    speaking to different audiences than playable media centered around combat
                    systems or resource management. While players can be creative and express
                    themselves through game actions that do not involve creating [<a class="ref" href="#wright2002">Wright et al. 2002</a>], creativity that results in the existence of
                    something new supports a creative pleasure not obtainable otherwise. <cite class="title italic">SimCity</cite>, <cite class="title italic">The Sims</cite>, and
                        <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite>, while vastly different in subject
                    matter (urban planning, house design and decoration, and block placement,
                    respectively), are all underwritten by player creation in virtual worlds, and
                    have all been highly influential, popular-culture phenomena in their times. Much
                    of their connected successes are in the novel experiences they enable, all
                    primarily driven by crafting. These pioneering, crafting-focused games have
                    transformed the playable media landscape, inspiring entirely new genres of
                    simulation and open-world, sandbox games [<a class="ref" href="#ondrejka2004">Ondrejka 2004</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#rose2014">Rose 2014</a>]. A new, more diverse audience of players has also been
                    drawn to these experiences, noteworthy in the field’s straight, white,
                    male-dominated history and tenacious reputation [<a class="ref" href="#kafai2008">Kafai et al. 2008</a>]

                    [<a class="ref" href="#thompson2003">Thompson 2003</a>], and <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite> has

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Making, creating, building—the language typically used to describe these
                    experiences—are vague descriptions for the complex fields of creativity and
                    design. We need to build a finer critical vocabulary around these systems to
                    more effectively discuss them. Additionally, crafting systems are often deeply
                    integrated into other game systems and mechanics, or operations of the game:
                    working as the production side to a rich in-game economy, or as vehicles for
                    player or game progression. Understanding the kinds of play crafting affords the
                    player, or where a crafting system could fit into a larger game’s context, is
                    currently under-explored in game studies.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">To build this understanding, we construct a taxonomy of crafting in games.
                    Taxonomies are a common tool in game studies, often used to discuss either types
                    of players [<a class="ref" href="#bartle1996">Bartle 1996</a>] or games and simulations themselves [<a class="ref" href="#klabbers2003">Klabbers 2003</a>]. We take the latter, game-centric approach.
                    Taxonomies create a shared vocabulary around complicated concepts to allow a
                    deeper and better-organized study of those concepts, which is the aim of this
                    article.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">When a player performs actions similar to those of a real-life crafter, or goes
                    about creating a virtual object using the mechanics, the system of those
                    mechanics may be colloquially known as a crafting system by the game’s designers
                    and/or players. "Crafting" is advertised as a feature of
                    games from <cite class="title italic">World of Warcraft</cite> to <cite class="title italic">Minecraft </cite>(and is even included in some of their
                    names). However, games implement their "crafting" vastly
                    differently; in <cite class="title italic">World of Warcraft</cite>, crafting is
                    highly abstracted, conducted through menus, and linked into a vast player
                    economy of items, goods and services. Crafting in <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite> is far closer to playing with LEGOs, as <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite> structures are built by players placing
                    virtual blocks on one another. These creations range from giant masterpieces to
                    bare-bones boxes that let players survive the dangerous night. This type of

                    several other crafting systems within <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite>
                    where players use a dedicated set of crafting menus to instantaneously create
                    and place objects into the player’s inventory. A third contrasting example would

                        dimension.</div></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">To generate these dimensions, we started by carefully reviewing a selection of
                    games that have clear instances of player creation. We looked at the games
                    themselves, as well as secondary literature around these games. Because crafting
                    is tied strongly to the real world, we also reviewed literature around
                    non-virtual crafting. Our taxonomy is built from concepts that have been
                    identified in other games studies work, as well as important concepts in the
                    study of real-world crafting.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9">After this initial review, we struggled to relate the many and often disparate
                    features of crafting in games. We could not find a
                        "canonical" crafting game, nor did we find it effective
                    to try to describe a set of categories that neatly discretizes the space into
                    mutually-exclusive groups of games or crafting systems. We instead identified
                    core attributes of crafting which different crafting systems had to varying
                    degrees. The attributes were orthogonal and nonhierarchical; having one
                    attribute didn’t require or preclude a game from having any other. Drawing
                    inspiration from past work in game studies by Jesper Juul, we created a
                    seven-dimensional model of crafting systems that described meaningful mechanical
                    differences within the games [<a class="ref" href="#juul2005">Juul 2005</a>]. This inclusive taxonomy
                    approach, involving placing terms at an intersection of orthogonal, scalar
                    dimensions, has proven illuminating and influential in game studies and is
                    further discussed below. After we first drafted our dimensions, largely inspired
                    by our survey of prototypical crafting games and literature on real-world
                    crafting, we set about formally encoding specific games in the taxonomy
                    one-by-one (or assigning values for them on each dimension). This process
                    revealed some ambiguities and redundancy in the taxonomy, which we then fixed.
                    We refined our taxonomy in this way over the course of about three months,
                    adding to our set of sample games, discussing and plotting them on the
                    dimensions, editing—and sometimes removing—dimensions, and repeating the
                    plotting process over again for all games collected thus far. We stopped when we
                    no longer needed to refine the taxonomy to adequately capture new sample games,
                    and when our set of sample games was sufficiently large and diverse, even
                    capturing edge-case crafting systems. A full report of every crafting system we
                    evaluated, their rankings on each dimension, and a brief description with
                    justifications accompanies this document as a stand-alone visualization website,

                            (pure games, pure simulations, and pure case studies), and four hybrids

                            categories: Agon, Alea, Mimicry and Ilinx. Agon refers competition and
                            balance, with all players having an equal chance of success. Alea refers
                            to luck, with players having little control over the game’s outcome.
                            Mimicry is about pretending to be someone else, and Ilinx refers to the
                            feeling of vertigo and attempting to disrupt normal sensory patterns.
                            Callois’ second dimension is focused on the rule base: Piada, freedom

                            combining concepts from social systems theory with a semiotic theory of
                            gaming, dividing agents in game into actors, rules and resources, each

                            whether players prefer action or interaction (the first) with other
                            players or the game world (the second). Similarly, Yee also talks about
                            player motivations in online games [<a class="ref" href="#yee2006">Yee 2006</a>]. Yee breaks
                            down player motivations into three primary categories (achievement,
                            social and immersion) and ten subcategories. In a meta-analysis, Smith
                            et. al. present a taxonomy of player modeling approaches, such as
                            examining whether the player model is general or specific, or
                            categorizes based on human reactions or game actions [<a class="ref" href="#smith2011">Smith et al. 2011</a>].</div>

                            of games [<a class="ref" href="#juul2005">Juul 2005</a>, 30], Juul derives six common
                            features to compose his own definitional framework: fixed rules,
                            variable outcome, valorization of outcome, player effort, player
                            attachment to outcome, and negotiable consequences [<a class="ref" href="#juul2005">Juul 2005</a>, 36]. Juul uses these features as measuring
                            sticks to determine how game-like an experience is. A <em class="emph">game</em>
                            has all of these features, while experiences like gambling or open-ended
                            simulations are borderline cases, and even looser experiences like
                            storytelling or free-form play are simply not games. Some features are
                            binary, such has alternative ending in an experience counting as not
                            having a fixed outcome. However, whether that uncertainty is based on
                            skill, luck, or how impactful it is on the experience of the outcome may
                            be lost.</div>

                            a game still have a place on Juul’s model. Readers can argue that
                            free-form play should count as a borderline case because free-form play
                            can spontaneously contain many of these game features. In making that
                            argument, readers such as [<a class="ref" href="#deterding2011">Deterding et al. 2011</a>] and [<a class="ref" href="#myers2009">Myers 2009</a>] are using Juul’s features and critical

                            ultimately land on the graph. Juul admits that his model "is no longer all there is to games"
                                 [<a class="ref" href="#juul2005">Juul 2005</a>, 53]. We understand that our model is also not all there is to
                            crafting systems. However, Juul understands his model is an abstract
                            tool, "an abstract platform upon which games are
                                    built, a platform that games use in different ways"

                            some combination of originality (or novelty, or innovation) and

                            However, some games, such as those discussed in the System Recognition
                            dimension, attempt to procedurally evaluate, model, or simulate some

                            in games. Winge and Stalp did an ethnographic study of 44 crafters,
                            primarily subversive ones, and some of their reasonings were: for
                            necessity (or lack thereof), to develop skills (learn), to relax, to
                            have fun, to create a supportive space, and to develop identity [<a class="ref" href="#winge2013">Winge and Stalp 2013</a>]. Many find it "therapeutic"
                            to quietly reflect, or think about nothing at all, and to watch a
                            product slowly unfold [<a class="ref" href="#winge2013">Winge and Stalp 2013</a>, 75]. To summarize,
                            some craft to make a specific object or outcome, and others for the
                            process of making regardless of the outcome. While the value of a
                            specific object may be worth the cost of admission to create it, in the
                            real world or in a game, the process is the more interesting motivation
                            here. Through Csikszentmihalyi, we find a common thread to games and
                            crafting: the flow state [<a class="ref" href="#csikszentmihalyi1996">Csikszentmihalyi 1996</a>]. While
                            not the only feeling involved in the process of crafting, the flow

                            person’s whole concentration—is shared with gaming in general, as well

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33">We further develop our preliminary definition of crafting in games:
                        <em class="emph">crafting</em> in a game is the set of mechanics and interactions by
                    which players thoughtfully manipulate materials to create a new entity in the
                    game world. The entity<a class="noteRef" href="#d18523e846">[7]</a> might be
                    created from scratch, or created by modifying or augmenting something that
                    existed before crafting. The entity may be animate or inanimate, a
                    representative of real-life crafting or some fully imaginary and virtual form of
                    crafting only possible in the abstractions of playable media. Resources are
                    often consumed or transformed in the creation process, but don’t have to be. The
                    mechanics and interactions which comprise crafting include actions and choices
                    that players make during the creation process,<a class="noteRef" href="#d18523e850">[8]</a>
                    and the game system’s immediate responses and mechanical interactions with those
                    actions and choices. Players should enact these actions and choices with the
                    intention of making something, and with the feeling that accompanies, even if
                    they don’t know precisely what the created thing will be. And finally, the
                    creation process and the created entity are explicitly represented in the
                    context of the game world<a class="noteRef" href="#d18523e853">[9]</a>.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">In this definition, we aim to outline a general game experience for which the
                    following design dimensions may be a useful analytical tool, rather than
                    prescribe a narrow characterization of what crafting in games always is and
                    always will be. Creating virtual objects in games happens in many genres and
                    thematic domains, in both computational and non-computational games, and in
                    dialog with many other game systems. The proposed seven-dimensional framework
                    cuts across these differences, posing questions and design considerations, and
                    mapping the experiential space in a way that a narrow definition cannot. We
                    propose that the wide definition offered above be used as a rough guideline for
                    what games to apply the dimensions to, in order to answer game studies and game
                    design questions more useful than, "Is it a crafting system?"

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">What follows are descriptions of seven dimensions or axes that characterize and
                    explore the space of possibilities surrounding crafting in games. While similar
                    to Jesper Juul’s dimensions of games, our dimensions will differ from his in
                    that in his system there is a canonical concept of game as exemplified by games
                    like chess. Games that score high on all of his dimensions converge on this
                    canonical concept. In contrast, there is no canonical crafting system, just as
                    there is no canonical real-life craft or way to craft. So there is no position
                    along the dimensions that converges to a canonical crafting concept, no position
                    along any given dimension that is implicitly preferred. Rather, each point on
                    each dimension supports different kinds of experiences and play. Among the 64
                    systems surveyed and discussed here, some readers may also contest particular
                    examples as not "crafting" systems, according to common game
                    cultures’ understandings of crafting. However, we illustrate that the framework
                    is designed to surface useful discussion wherever players create things in
                    virtual worlds. It is intended to serve as a lens, rather than a box, and is
                    informed but not prescribed by the sometimes arbitrary labeling traditions of
                    different gaming communities. We have sampled a wide enough range of different
                    systems to both stretch the boundaries of our dimensions, as well as illustrate
                    combinations of characteristics that have yet to be implemented as gaming
                    experiences in order to help discover them.</div>

                    crafting systems, not games within which crafting systems are embedded.
                    Individual games can have multiple crafting systems. Games like <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite> are so committed to crafting that they have
                    multiple, interwoven playable models of crafting, each of which will have their
                    own characterization along the crafting design dimensions. </div>

                    enactments of crafting: Recipe Definition, Fidelity of Action, and Completion
                    Constraints. That is followed by what happens after that process is enacted:
                    Variable Outcome and System Recognition of Outcome. Our list concludes with
                    qualities of the larger game experience within which the player may have enacted
                    crafting many times: Player Expressiveness and Progression. </div>

                        transform a collection of game objects (ingredients or raw materials) into a
                        new object. For example (described more below), a recipe for a pickaxe might
                        specify two twigs and two flint as the materials necessary to create a
                        pickaxe. Just as objects such as twigs, flint and pickaxes can be virtually
                        possessed by a player, so too can recipes be possessed, where recipe
                        possession means that the player now possesses the knowledge to perform the
                        transformation from ingredients to produced object, typically represented
                        within the game by providing this transformation as a new player action. </div>

                        leaving no room for customization or choice in ingredient specifics. This
                        provides less control for the player, but greater control to the game
                        creator, who can explicitly enumerate all possible craftable objects. At the
                        other extreme are crafting systems with <em class="term">undefined recipes</em>. Such
                        systems use an underlying simulation to determine what happens when objects
                        are combined to create a new object. By not enforcing specific ingredient
                        combinations, this opens more possibilities for experimental and creative
                        play, but reduces the game creators’ control over crafting. Between these
                        two extremes are recipes with some predefined structure that support

                            in games that such systems are more commonly called

                            classic example of a strongly defined recipe-based system (Figure 3).
                            For example, to make a pickaxe, the player needs two twigs and two flint
                            in their inventory, opens the tools crafting menu, selects the pickaxe
                            icon, and clicks "build." The player similarly clicks
                            on other object icons and their “build” buttons to make torches, traps,
                            top hats, crock pots, etc.</div>

                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">The recipe for an item never changes, and never allows a range of

                            recipes also never vary in their output. If the player selects and
                                "builds" the "pickaxe," she
                            will inescapably have two twigs and two flint removed from their
                            inventory and replaced with a pickaxe. There’s no notion of
                            contextualized raw ingredients, of different kinds or shapes of wood or
                            stone, perhaps from different parts of the virtual world, which might

                            used to create. A crafted pickaxe also isn’t changed by random dice
                            rolls, or by the experience, handiness, or personality of the player or

                            development complexity and tightening authorial control over a player’s
                            experience. Strongly defined recipes have an analog to
                            node-and-link-based hypertext, especially when the result is at first
                            unknown to the player. Performing a crafting action using the recipe is
                            like traversing a hypertext link, where the source text is the set of
                            input ingredients, and the destination text is the output of crafting.
                            That the two "texts" are connected by a
                                "crafting" relationship signals a

                            structure placed in the world, which itself is a crafting station for
                            producing food items. The player navigates to it, clicks on it, fills
                            the four available slots with individual ingredients, clicks
                                "cook," and waits for the result to appear in the
                            pot. Crockpot cooking is recipe-based because each combination of four
                            ingredients placed in the slots is linked to an output according to
                            hand-authored connections (where order of the four ingredients doesn’t
                            matter), but the recipes are templated. Each one allows multiple
                            different ingredient combinations for the same output. For example, the
                            Stuffed Eggplant recipe calls for one eggplant, one vegetable food item,
                            and two fillers (Figure 4). The eggplant requirement can be fulfilled by
                            two different single items (eggplant and cooked eggplant), and the
                            vegetable and filler can be fulfilled by 25 and 52 different items,
                            respectively. In effect, Stuffed Eggplant can be produced in 2x25x52x52
                            = 135,200 different ways.</div>

                            filler or with meat, the space of possible input gives the player
                            potentially interesting choices to make in enacting the recipe. She can
                            execute the recipe strategically, using the most widely available or
                            lowest valued ingredients in the set of options. A strategic enactment
                            of Stuffed Eggplant would be to use twigs, a low-risk, readily
                            available, widespread resource in the world, before meat, which is
                            usually risky, rare, and more productively used in other recipes. And
                            the player can adapt her enactment according to what she has an
                            abundance of at the time. But she can also enact it in support of more
                            self-expressive play, which can be encouraged or discouraged by other
                            aspects of the game’s design and the context of crafting. For example,
                            the player can use less efficient ingredients even when there’s an
                            option to use others, if the less efficient ingredient suits their
                            specific play style or desired experience, particularly in terms of
                            role-playing, perceived realism, or exploration and experimentation (see
                            Player Expressiveness). Furthermore, defining a recipe as a space of
                            input, rather than a single possibility, changes the way the player
                            thinks about their crafting. The player can see resources in the world
                            as classes of ingredients connected by abstract properties, and,
                            similarly, interpret crafted entities as the union of abstract
                            properties that define their input parameters. </div>
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p49">49</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p49">The second kind of parametric recipe is one which represents, rather than

                            There is still a space of possible input, like the multiple options of
                            many <cite class="title italic">Don’t Starve</cite> crockpot recipes, but now
                            the choice among those options is represented in the output. Consider,
                            for example, the <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite> pickaxe (Figure
                            5). The player arranges materials in the same, T-shaped graphical recipe
                            to craft any pickaxe in the game. The handle is always formed by two
                            vertical sticks, but the head can use several different kinds of blocks,
                            with the different materials contributing different strength and
                            durability values for the resulting pickaxe. The pickaxe recipe, in
                            effect, is parameterized by those materials. The pickaxe isn’t
                            completely defined; the player has room to enact the recipe in different
                            ways. But, unlike for Stuffed Eggplant, different ingredients produce
                            observable changes in the resulting item. </div>

                                can be used to form the head, making it parametric. The material

                        life, a knitter performing the craft uses manual dexterity to manipulate a
                        continuous thread on two sticks called needles, which produces a knit
                        fabric. The act of knitting has been represented in games in a wide range of
                        fidelity that stretch across this dimension. <cite class="title italic">Knitting
                            Simulator 2014</cite> is an example of extremely high fidelity to
                        knitting because it involves embodied knitting, the player physically
                        mimicking the act of a knitter, on custom game controllers consisting of
                        knitting needles with motion sensors. Each wiggle of the knitting needles
                        represents stitch progress in the game. A game with less fidelity in the
                        knitting genre would be <cite class="title italic">Crafting Mama</cite> on the
                        3DS. Without any controllers representing the knitting needles, the player’s
                        embodied action while playing the game is tapping the stylus on the Nintendo
                        DS screen, which is further away from those in <cite class="title italic">Knitting
                            Simulator 2014</cite> and from real-life knitting. However, the player
                        does tap the screen rapidly to progress stitch-by-stitch, and in traditional
                            <cite class="title italic">Mama</cite> fashion, she judges your performance
                        at the end, and you can even dress up Mama in your scarf. The knitting
                        mini-game in <cite class="title italic">Crafting Mama</cite> is still very much
                        about the act of knitting. Games with the lowest amount of fidelity in their
                        crafts abstract away the process and leave nothing but a progress bar and/or
                        an end result. For example, a tailor in <cite class="title italic">World of
                            Warcraft</cite> (<cite class="title italic">WoW</cite>) makes fabric, using
                        nothing but fiber, at a click of a button. It could be a woven, knit, or
                        even felted fabric; the player’s character could be using knitting needles,
                        a loom, a crochet hook, or some other tool. We just don’t know. The fidelity
                        of fabric-creation in the case of <cite class="title italic">WoW</cite> is
                        extremely low, so low that we cannot distinguish the process as

                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p71">71</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p71">Time is a complex topic in games. According to Zagal &amp; Mateas, there
                            are four common temporal frames: real-world time (experienced in the
                            physical world), gameworld time (in-game time including events around
                            gameplay action), coordination time (coordination between player and
                            agents, such as navigating menus), and fictive time (acknowledged
                            sociocultural labels and event sequences) [<a class="ref" href="#zagal2010">Zagal and Mateas 2010</a>].
                            Sometimes, crafting takes time in any of these temporal frames. This
                            slows down a player’s completion rate, either because crafting comprises
                            a game in and of itself which takes time to play, or players just need
                            to wait a certain amount of time before the crafting is finished (in
                            real-world time or gameworld time). However, not all time is created
                            equal. Some crafting delays take up all of the player’s focus and
                            ability to perform other tasks, while other delays are completely
                            idle.</div>

                            player must spend time performing a sequence of crafting actions to
                            complete a craft, during which time the player cannot perform other
                            gameplay actions without abandoning the crafting sequence (Figure 15).

                            Automation) allow a player to remain attentive of other things as the
                            performing of crafting actions is automated, but she still needs to wait
                            for crafting to complete. In the same vein, players cannot act while

                            locations serve as meaningful completion constraints, however. <cite class="title italic">Kerbal Space Program</cite> has specialized hangers
                            where a player builds rocket ships and space planes, but a player can
                            snap to these locations at any time (even in the middle of a rocket
                            launch). Thus, they provide a thematic frame for construction
                            (construction happens in hangars), but don’t introduce an actual
                            gameplay constraint within the crafting system. Systems that include

                            how it relates to design. Items created with unregulated or free
                            workmanship often look very different from each other, but can serve the
                            same functional purposes. In addition, they can be of the same quality,
                            even if they look very different. This kind of variability relates to
                            the improvisational skill of the craftsperson given the dynamic richness
                            of real-world situations. In contrast, variable outcome in game crafting
                            systems often works against Pye’s dream of aesthetic variability. Given
                            the stochastic modeling of object attributes typical in crafting systems
                            with variable outcome, the results are often not functionally

                            However, as players progress, they unlock more crafting skills which

                            being able to fill the progress bar. As players progress, filling the
                            quality bar becomes more feasible, and players can more consistently

                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p104">104</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p104">In games like <cite class="title italic">Besiege</cite>, with particularly
                            high outcome recognition, the core loop often emphasizes it via a
                            separate, watch-it-run or simulation phase, following the crafting.
                            Often, the phase makes the crafted item more traditionally playable,
                            with movement-control or other minimal interactivity. True also of
                                <cite class="title italic">Kerbal Space Program</cite>, <cite class="title italic">Incredipede</cite>, and <cite class="title italic">Spore</cite> character creation, this affords the player the
                            unique pleasure of seeing her creations theatrically come to life, in a
                            performative reveal after a suspense-building crafting period. The
                            player creates with an idea of what will happen, runs the simulation and
                            inevitably finds her idea only partially correct, but in an
                            understandable way, so that her idea of what will happen is updated to
                            reflect a better understanding of the simulation. Her updated mental
                            model is immediately actionable in the next crafting phase. The
                            game-internal core loop is neatly translatable to the player-internal
                            iterative model-making loop of the <cite class="title italic">SimCity</cite>
                            Effect [<a class="ref" href="#wardripfruin2009">Wardrip-Fruin 2009</a>]. Further,
                                "live" recognition, that happens in real time,
                            both as the item is crafted and afterward, as with <cite class="title italic">Minecraft</cite> block placement, supports player embodiment as a
                            character in the virtual world, and is more commonly integrated with
                            larger gameplay experiences that aren’t focused primarily on crafting.
                            Furthermore, systems high on outcome recognition and low on recipe
                            definition generally support the <cite class="title italic">SimCity</cite>
                            Effect (named for a live crafting system), regardless of the presence of
                            a detached watch-it-run phase after crafting.</div>
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p105">105</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p105">Other patterns of system recognition include graphical modeling and
                            physics simulation (e.g., gravity, collision, fluid physics), impact on
                            a stats system (combat, character progression, NPC relationships), and
                            adjacency bonuses in base or city-building (e.g. building a Theatre
                            District next to a Natural Wonder in <cite class="title italic">Civilization
                                6</cite> produces bonus culture). All of these can vary on system
                            recognition by how flat or complex the model is. </div>
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p106">106</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p106">Another interesting pattern is the use of outcome recognition to identify
                            conditions-based recipes in an otherwise undefined recipe system. In
                                <cite class="title italic">Terraria</cite>, houses can be built for NPCs
                            using the general block-placement system, anywhere in the large sandbox
                            world. But NPCs will only become residents if particular requirements
                            are met: blocks are placed to form a fully enclosed structure, with at
                            least one entrance, covering at least 60 total tiles, but less than 750,
                            containing at least one valid light source, flat surface item, and
                            comfort item. The system will check for player structures which satisfy
                            this <cite class="title italic">after</cite> crafting, rather than impose the
                            requirements before the structure can be built at all, as in strongly
                            defined recipe crafting. This pattern is also visible in the gardening
                            of <cite class="title italic">Viva Piñata</cite>, in which specific clusters
                            of player-placed items and piñata residents in a garden entice other
                            piñatas to visit and become residents. This style of recognition enables
                            both the creative experimentation and expression of freeform crafting as
                            well as the authorial control of predefined recipes. When players
                            discover these implicit recipes, without having looked them up or known
                            about them beforehand, this style of system recognition can be a
                            delightful and surprising meeting of minds between the player and
                            system. </div>
                        <div class="counter"><a href="#p107">107</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p107">Games with undefined recipes often have high system recognition, as with

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p108">108</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p108">The dimension of player expressiveness captures the range of reasonable
                        actions and outcomes within a crafting system suggested by the domain of the
                        game world. "Expressiveness" is a somewhat vague term, as
                        is "creativity" (See Craft and Creativity), but this
                        dimension focuses on the amount of reasonable choice the player has, given
                        the game’s setting and the tools provided to them, during the process of
                        crafting. This dimension is not trying to capture players explicitly
                        subverting or exploiting a crafting system, as might occur in counter-play.
                        Further, this dimension is not about the process of choosing what to craft,
                        nor about the uses of the item after being made. For example, this dimension
                        is about the process of customization and sewing of a shirt, not about
                        choosing to wear the shirt (because it may be pretty or powerful), nor about
                        how to dye, alter, or equip the shirt in a different crafting system after
                        being completed. In short, we are ignoring the infinite combinatorial
                        influences of outside systems as much as possible, but we acknowledge that
                        an outside influence can inspire creative action or exploration. We do not
                        care where inspiration comes from; this dimension only measures whether or
                        not the player can express her inspiration successfully. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p109">109</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p109">For example, in <cite class="title italic">Draw Something</cite>, the player is
                        given a one-word prompt to draw, and she is victorious if the other player
                        guesses her prompt successfully. The player is free to draw anything she
                        likes in a rainbow of colors, whether or not it supports the prompt. The
                        user may draw an expansive beach scene, put Batman lounging in a beach chair
                        with a coconut drink complete with tiny umbrella, and point to the little
                        straw in the cup for the prompt “straw.” While the brushes and drawing tools
                        are extremely basic, players can use fingertips or a stylus to be as
                        creative as they like or spend as much time on a drawing as they desire, and
                        this results in extremely high player expressiveness.</div>

                        interact with the cats, which are common actions players may want to do with
                        real or virtual cats. There is a lack of fulfillment of player desires in
                        customizing their homes or interacting with their cultivated garden of
                        adorable felines, which results in lower player expressiveness. A game world

                        capitalize on them has the lowest level of Player Expressiveness. For
                        example, <cite class="title italic">Knitting Simulator 2014</cite>, which
                        emulates knitting extremely well, offers no ability to change, adjust, or
                        customize yarn color, pattern, or stitches. All of the creative choice a
                        crafter has when knitting is absent. The mechanics of the game distill down
                        to a progress bar, leaving no space for player agency and no support for
                        player choice. In the terms of Mateas, this would be called an imbalance of
                        material affordances (reasonable player desire) and formal affordances (game
                        system support) [<a class="ref" href="#mateas2001">Mateas 2001</a>], expanded in [<a class="ref" href="#wardripfruinetal2009">Wardrip-Fruin et al. 2009</a>]. In these examples, we show that high
                        player expressiveness is a combination of a creative domain or space that
                        begs for customization, as well as mechanical support for the player to
                        create within that space. </div>

                            skipping game challenges by amassing experience, automatically aiming at

                            crafting skill. Most commonly, crafting skill is represented as an
                            abstract number, and increasing this number is interpreted as an avatar
                            becoming more skilled at a craft. Not all forms of leveling in a game

                            level that are abstractions over the avatar’s skill in a variety of
                            domains. Leveling up combat-focused skills (like one-handed weapon
                            combat) does not impact the player’s ability to craft in any way, while
                            certain skills in <cite class="title italic">Skyrim</cite> are centered

                            crafting, a player progresses through levels by building balls, called
                            katamaris, to a certain size or with specific types of items. Because
                            the level requirements of the player’s katamari get more and more
                            demanding, moving from level to level works as a form of crafting
                            leveling, unlocking new resources to use in katamaris as well as
                            proposing new recipes. The player may not think to make a katamari
                            almost solely of school supplies, but the level requirements force the
                            player to make conscious choices on what to pick up with their katamari.

                        automation while maintaining a higher degree of player fidelity. A macro is
                        a small program, built within game provided tools, that can automate some
                        character actions. As a defense against botting, or having entirely
                        autonomously controlled agents within a game, it is rare to see program flow
                        control structures or loops as part of a game-provided toolkit for macroing.
                        However, some games have historically afforded loops and if statements in
                        their macro systems; for example, <cite class="title italic">Star Wars
                            Galaxies</cite> had self-callable macros, which affords repetition like
                        loops through recursion. With a rich macroing language, a game can have a
                        higher degree of fidelity while still allowing some players to automate the

                        and encoded in the system. However, even games with no recipe definition can
                        afford automation.</div>

                            game.</div></div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p138">138</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p138">Variable Outcome is problematic when it comes to automation, especially when
                        we reflect back on real-world crafting. On one hand, games that read high on
                        this dimension often work as motivation for why a player might want to
                        automate the crafting process. A player searching for an optimal item in a
                        game with a lot of randomness in crafting might need to craft the same item
                        20, 50 or even 100 times. It is not hard to imagine why such a player might
                        want autonomous tools. On the other hand, Variable Outcome thwarts the
                        regulation that is associated with mass production, automation and the
                        workmanship of certainty. Crafting systems with high variable outcome have
                        large fluctuations in outcome quality even with automated ways to go about
                        the crafting process. Crafting systems high in variable outcome have a
                        reason to add automation affordances to their crafting systems to help
                        mediate the monotony of searching for a highly desirable outcome. However,
                        this process of using automation to burn through bad results is a different
                        experience from how automation functions in real-world crafting, where
                        automation and the workmanship of certainty prevent particular bad results
                        from ever occurring.</div>

                        produce a large quantity of items, games also afford a player to inspect,
                        handle, and quantize a large amount of crafted output. These sorts of
                        systems are a bit beyond the scope of this paper, but it is worth

                            amount of multiplayer connection, either as a MMO-type game or with the
                            ability to share in-game entities with other players. Within these
                            games, players can make commissions of other players personally, as well
                            as trade their crafted goods in in-game auction houses, or simply
                            collect or curate their favorite designs. For example, MMOs such as

                            materials with other players. Some players of MMO games that include a

                            customers. Customers have a reputation with the player character which
                            increases their budget, so short-term discounts may lead to long-term
                            profits. Not many games bother with modeling these social behaviors,
                            which leaves this space very under-explored. Another game, <cite class="title italic">Spore</cite>, managed to share its wide variety of

                    crafting is or means in games. We’ve proposed a definition of crafting and shown
                    a seven-dimensional framework that highlights important features of crafting
                    across a myriad of games and systems. In Recipe Definition we separated games
                    around the notion of a recipe and how free-form the crafting experience may be.
                    For the Fidelity of Action dimension, we examined how detailed and performative
                    player actions are, and how closely they correspond to any real-world crafting
                    equivalents. We enumerated the types of constraints a game puts on completing a
                    craft in Completion Constraints. We addressed randomness and the amount of
                    control a player has over the outcome of a crafting attempt in Variable Outcome.
                    We analyze how richly a system understands and models the outcome of a crafting
                    attempt in System Recognition of Outcome. In Player Expressiveness, we examined
                    the range of creative actions available in crafting domains, and how they are
                    supported by material and formal affordances. Finally, for the Progression
                    dimension, we enumerated the types of advancement the player may achieve from
                    interacting with the crafting system over time.</div>
