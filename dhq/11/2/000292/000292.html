                <p>This paper describes how to deal with the scarcity of born-digital primary
                    sources while retrieving materials on the recent past of an academic
                    institution. The case study is an analysis of the first 25 years online of the
                    University of Bologna. The focus of this work is primarily methodological:
                    several different issues are presented, starting with the fact that the
                    University of Bologna website has been excluded for thirteen years from the
                    Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, and possible solutions are proposed and
                    applied. Moreover, this study aims at highlighting how web materials could give
                    us new and distinct insights into the recent past of academic institutions,
                    thereby becoming the starting point for several new studies.</p>

            <div class="div div0">
                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The University of Bologna is considered to be the world’s oldest university in
                    terms of continuous operation. Its nine-hundred year old roots can be traced
                    back to the figure of the early recorded scholar, jurist and instructor Irnerius
                        [<a class="ref" href="#capitani1987">Capitani 1987</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e169">[1]</a>.
                    The study of specific aspects of the past of this institution has already
                    offered researchers the unique possibility of digging deeper into the
                    relationship between the university, its large student community and the city of
                    Bologna itself [<a class="ref" href="#brizzi1991">Brizzi 1991</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#barbagli2009">Barbagli 2009</a>].
                    Additionally, this kind of research has also allowed a better understanding of
                    its key historical role in the Italian academic "ecosystem"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#brizzi2007">Brizzi 2007</a>]. Several sources have been used to trace its past,
                    starting from textual documents preserved in the university archive [<a class="ref" href="#rea1996">Rea 1996</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#romano2007">Romano 2007</a>] to its collection of over
                    six hundred portraits [<a class="ref" href="#gandolfi2011">Gandolfi 2011</a>].</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Since the introduction of the World Wide Web, a new and different kind of primary
                    source has been available for historical research on the recent past of this
                    academic institution: born digital documents, materials that exist only online
                    and the role of which will increasingly be recognized as complementary to
                    traditional-analogue and digitized sources [<a class="ref" href="#brügger2016">Brügger 2016</a>].
                    However, due to their digital nature, these new sources are already more
                    difficult to preserve, retrieve and analyze compared to traditional materials
                        [<a class="ref" href="#rosenzweig2003">Rosenzweig 2003</a>];[<a class="ref" href="#brügger2009">Brügger 2009</a>];[<a class="ref" href="#lafrance2015">LaFrance 2015</a>]. For this reason, during the last twenty years,
                    public and private web archive initiatives all around the world have been
                    preserving them for future studies.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Materials from the Internet Archive, the most important and comprehensive web
                    archive [<a class="ref" href="#gomes2011">Gomes 2011</a>], have already shown their potential as new
                    primary sources in a few pioneering studies [<a class="ref" href="#bendavid2016">Ben-David 2016</a>];[<a class="ref" href="#milligan2017">Milligan 2017</a>]. Specifically talking about these new documents,
                    Ian Milligan has recently raised a very provocative question: "Could one even study the 1990s and beyond without web
                        archives?"<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e212">[2]</a>.
                    Milligan, with this question, re-evokes an old teaching from Marc Bloch, namely
                    the fact that "everything that man says or writes, everything that he
                            makes, everything he touches can or ought to teach us about him"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#bloch1949">Bloch 1949</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e223">[3]</a>. However, at the same time, Milligan’s question
                    addresses another, more methodological, aspect. Could one study the past, and
                    more precisely our <em class="emph">recent digital past</em>, without web archives?</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">This study, which focuses on the recent past of the University of Bologna through
                    its digital sources, explores both aspects of Milligan’s question. It starts by
                    considering the facts that (a) the University of Bologna’s main website
                    (hereafter "Unibo.it")<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e235">[4]</a> was not accessible through the Internet Archive’s Wayback
                    Machine when this research was conducted (as described in [<a class="ref" href="#nanni2015">Nanni 2015</a>]) and (b) Italy is one of the few countries in Western
                    Europe that does not systematically preserve its National web sphere [<a class="ref" href="#gomes2011">Gomes 2011</a>]<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e241">[5]</a>.
                    By doing so, the goal of this paper is to address the following research
                    questions:</div>

                <div class="ptext"><ul class="list"><li class="item">Is it possible to reconstruct and study the past of a university website
                        (namely the changes in its layout, structure and content, but more
                        importantly the reasons that have caused them) without having at prompt
                        disposal a collection of web archive snapshots?</li><li class="item">Could this study guide us to better understand the role the website has
                        played in the interactions between the academic institution and its large

                        recent past of the institution in itself?</li><li class="item">Will this research bring new materials <em class="emph">to the surface</em>, in
                        ways that are useful for the research communities that, so far, have focused
                        on the past and present of academic institutions?</li></ul></div>

                <h1 class="head">Specific contribution</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Before starting, it is important to note a few aspects of the paper presented
                    here. First of all, this research does not set out to be a comprehensive
                    overview on the methodological approaches used in the diachronic study of
                    websites. On the contrary, the goal of this paper is to present a first-hand
                    experience on the issues that emerge when employing born digital materials as
                    primary sources and when considering websites as "objects of study"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#brügger2009">Brügger 2009</a>]. Presenting the problems encountered while retrieving born digital
                    documents and the solutions adopted could be useful to other scholars who, in
                    the near future, intend to use the same materials in their research.
                    Additionally, while the focus of our first research question is primarily
                    methodological (more explicitly: how a website’s lost past was reconstructed),
                    this study does not intend to be limited to what Blevins recently defined the "perpetual sunrise of methodology"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#blevins2015">Blevins 2015</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#blevins2016">Blevins 2016</a>], which in his vision is the main characteristic of
                    current digital history. In fact, the other two research questions emphasize how
                    web materials could give us new and distinct insights into the recent past of
                    academic institutions, thereby becoming the starting point for several new
                    studies.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">This paper is organized in five parts. First, a series of works on web archives
                    and their use in humanities research, together with an overview on the research
                    fields that study the recent past of academic institutions, are presented. Next,
                    the types of sources employed in this work and their reliability are described
                    and discussed. The reconstruction of the web past of the University of Bologna
                    occupies the central part of the paper. Given the peculiarity of the exclusion
                    issue that happened in the case of Unibo.it, the work which was conducted
                    together with the Internet Archive to understand and solve the exclusion of
                    Unibo.it from the Wayback Machine is then described. Finally, a new type of
                    primary source that was collected during the research is presented, highlighting
                    its usefulness for the communities that study academic institutions.</div>

                    different research fields. First, it discusses the consequences of the ways we
                    preserve (or not preserve – as in the case of Italy) the web of the past.
                    Second, it considers how web archival materials could be adopted in historical
                    research. Finally, it highlights the impact that these sources will have on
                    different research areas that focus on examining the recent past of academic
                    institutions. In the next pages, a general overview of these research areas by
                    presenting a series of related works will be offered.</div>

                        sources in historical studies. The first, described for example by Brügger
                            [<a class="ref" href="#brügger2012a">Brügger 2012a</a>], has its roots in the fields of media and
                        Internet studies and aims at examining the web of the past by
                        contextualizing and understanding changes in layout, structure, content and
                        use. In 2010, Brügger edited the first book on the topic, and the title of
                        the volume, <cite class="title italic">Web History</cite>, clearly highlighted
                        the research topic of the community [<a class="ref" href="#brügger2010">Brügger 2010</a>]. A similar
                        focus emerges upon reading the objectives of a new journal titled <cite class="title italic">Internet Histories</cite>, recently launched by Niels

                        on the entire historical profession; for this reason, web archive materials
                        could soon become new sources for political as well as social, cultural and
                        economic historians. Recent works, such as the studies conducted by Anat Ben

                            consequence of the IX Century anniversary of the Alma Mater [<a class="ref" href="#pancaldi1993">Pancaldi 1993</a>]. Originally, CIS was a small research group
                            with a focus on the history of science and universities. The first
                            volume published, <cite class="title italic">Universities and the Sciences:

                            build a bridge between the history of universities and the history of
                            science. Among the board of directors was Gian Paolo Brizzi, a professor
                            of modern history with a strong research focus on the history of Italian
                            universities.</div>

                            differentiated their research topics, with the first becoming a
                            coordination structure in Italy for the study of Italian academic
                            institutions (see for example [<a class="ref" href="#negrini1998">Negrini 1998</a>];[<a class="ref" href="#dröscher2002">Dröscher 2002</a>]) and the second moving increasingly towards
                            the history of science, technology and the STS. However, a few doctoral
                            students at CIS have continued to examine the recent history of
                            universities and their interactions with political, economic and social

                    overview of the role of the website for the university and its community. As a
                    first step, information related to the website was collected from the university
                    yearbooks and through the analysis of the university’s archived records. This
                    provided an initial understanding of the administrative role of the website
                    (through a top-down view) and indicated the people involved in its supervision.
                    As a second step, interviews were conducted with those who have been managing
                    Unibo.it during the last two decades. This helped, especially, in discovering
                    the motivations behind specific changes and to trace down who, in the early 90s,
                    created the website and for what reasons. The analysis was then consolidated by
                    employing information retrieved from local and national newspaper archives, such
                    as <cite class="title italic">La Repubblica</cite> and <cite class="title italic">Il Resto
                        del Carlino</cite>, student forums and Usenet discussion groups. These
                    materials facilitated a better understanding of the role that the website has
                    played over the years as a "bridge" between the institution and its

                            useful in different steps of our work is the university yearbook. The
                            yearbook offers a general overview of the main activities of the

                            diachronic overview of the official teams that were managing Unibo.it.
                            When the different teams were contacted, the goal was to conduct
                            interviews and to collect materials related to the website, such as
                            archived documents as well as backups.</div>

                            an overview on the new functionalities on the website (e.g. free email

                            could sound strange as the goal of a national web archive is precisely
                            to preserve the web of its country. However, as this preservation
                            process is highly complex (as described by [<a class="ref" href="#brügger2009">Brügger 2009</a>]), from time to time part of the non-national web will also end up
                            being unintentionally preserved. For example, to archive national web
                            spheres in an automatic way, archivists could set up crawlers with a
                            maximum number of hyperlinks they can follow, with a specific set of
                            starting points. A crawler which is set to go at most 10 links away from
                            one of these URLs could also end up crawling non-national content, as it
                            will systematically follow all the hyperlinks. For this reason, if the
                            University of Bologna were to organize a Summer School and the
                            University of Amsterdam had linked it from its website, the University

                        an English one. Moreover, as the university has five campuses, the website
                        is consequently divided into five subsections (for example, <a class="ref" href="http://www.unibo.it/it/campus-forli" onclick="window.open('http://www.unibo.it/it/campus-forli'); return false">http://www.unibo.it/it/campus-forli</a>). As the English version

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p39">39</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p39">Luca Garlaschelli was the Chief of the Information/Innovation Office (CIO) at

                            "Sistema Portale di Ateneo" was created. This
                        is a general interface to a hierarchical organization of all the digital
                        resources of the university that are available online, with a specific focus
                        on enhancing the accessibility of the information at disposal<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e820">[23]</a>. As it
                        will be presented in the next pages, this has led to a revolutionary
                        transformation of the digital presence of the institution, which made
                        Unibo.it a reference point for all other Italian university websites. As a
                        matter of fact, for three consecutive years Unibo.it received the "Osc@r del web" prize as the best Italian public
                        administration website<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e832">[24]</a>.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">Among several improvements of the website, this transformation required that
                        all departments and web pages which provided information on the various
                        degree programs change their structure and adopt a common layout and
                        organization of their content. As an example, the Department of Classic and
                        Medieval Philology and the Department of Computer Science had to change
                        their URL addresses to standardized ones ("abbreviation of the name of the
                            department" + "unibo.it"). Thus, the first one changed from:
                        http://www.classics.unibo.it/ to http://www.ficlit.unibo.it/ and the second
                        one from http://www.cs.unibo.it/ to http://www.informatica.unibo.it/. This
                        transition started in 2004 and often required the creation of completely new
                        department pages. A few departments decided to keep the older version of
                        their sub-domains online by adding a "2" after the "www"<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e851">[25]</a> (as an

                        removed the old versions of their page from the live web, for example the
                        Department of History, whose URL was: http://www.dds.unibo.it/.</div>

                        (as described in [<a class="ref" href="#nanni2015">Nanni 2015</a>];[<a class="ref" href="#bendavid2016">Ben-David 2016</a>]).
                        For example, the Department of Philosophy and Communication Studies were two
                        different departments until 2012 and the Department of Philosophy used
                        http://www.filosofia.unibo.it as a URL even before the transition to the
                            "Sistema Portale d’Ateneo". However, in the
                        90s, this department used another URL for a couple of years,
                        http://www.sofia.philo.unibo.it which, without the memories of the people
                        who managed the sub-section at that time, would have been be very difficult

                        collection of seven .png images (see Appendix) that capture the most
                        important instances in the evolution of the organization of the homepage
                        before the current layout (1996 – 2013)<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e897">[28]</a>. This was important as a
                        starting point for understanding how the website structure and layout
                        changed during the years. Looking at the snapshots after 2002 we can observe
                        that, even if a few graphical adjustments were made (the Unibo-Magazine was
                        introduced on the left in 2004; the search tool was repositioned in the
                        center in 2006, etc.), the structure remained more or less the same until
                        the July 2013, when the current interface was presented. The present
                        organization of the "Sistema Portale d’Ateneo" is
                        the first one to be completely created by CeSIA without the supervision of
                        Luca Garlaschelli and, along with a new graphic interface, its main
                        characteristic is the fact that it offers for the first time the possibility
                        of surfing the website as a specific user (a prospective student, a student,
                        a private company, etc.) and it proposes different contents accordingly,
                        thereby allowing better optimization and personalization of the website.</div>

                        to be able to explore again the old versions of the website, other services
                        have to be employed. As a start, the Internet Memory Foundation offers the
                        results of the 2006 national ".it" crawl online, but only a single
                        snapshot of Unibo.it homepage is available (archived on the 8th of May

                        and that is not even completely preserved. As previously noted, other
                        national web archives could have captured, from time to time, parts of the
                        Italian web sphere. Among them, it was discovered that both the Portuguese
                        (Arquivo) and Danish (Netarkivet) web archives have preserved parts of
                        Unibo.it several times from 2006. These snapshots (example in Figure 2)
                        permit us, for the first time, to explore and examine the differences in

                        Another interesting piece of news retrieved from the digital archive of

                        months before the project "Portale d’Ateneo"
                        started. In those days, the University of Bologna website won the "WWW"

                            Ore</cite> for the best website in the category "School, university and research". At the ceremony Salvatore

                        For these reasons, they all evolved differently during the 90s and they are
                        now interesting instances on how the departments of this university
                        approached the World Wide Web.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">In addition to examining departmental pages, there are many other ways of

                        the information related to AlmaNET, the university internal Internet
                        connection, which in 1988 was established to connect three departments and
                        was highly improved in 1996<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1179">[58]</a>,
                        thanks to the collaboration of Telecom Italia and under the supervision of
                        CeSIA (which was created in 1994)<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1183">[59]</a>. Another
                        perspective on the recent past of this institution could be developed by the
                        examination of the impact of the online service AlmaLaurea, presented in May
                                1998<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1191">[60]</a>,
                        which aimed at improving the relationship between the institution, its
                        student community and the job-market. A third point of view might be focused
                        on the relation and mutual influence between the university and the
                        municipality, by considering the role played by the Internet. In fact, the
                        city of Bologna and its citizens have a strong bond with innovation in
                        computing technologies, with the municipality for instance having created
                        one of the first civic-networks in the world in 1995, giving to all citizens
                        free access to the Internet the very next year [<a class="ref" href="#chiara1998">Chiara 1998</a>].
                        The early importance of the web for Bologna citizens appeared also in a 1996
                        article retrieved from <cite class="title italic">La Repubblica</cite> digital
                        archive. As mentioned in the piece of news [<a class="ref" href="#venturi1996">Venturi 1996</a>], in
                        November of that year for the first time in Italy, a digital discussion was
                        censored and an entire mailing list named "Lisa"
                        was completely closed. This happened on the Unibo server<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1206">[61]</a>:
                        CeSIA informed the professor of computer science Dario Maio of the presence
                        of violent debates on the platform and the Department of Computer Science
                        decided to drastically intervene. As the article reported, these digital
                        conflicts were probably related to the internal discussion of an Italian
                        association named "La città invisibile"<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1212">[62]</a> ("The invisible city"). This association, comprising early
                        Internet activists, was interested in sharing the importance of digital
                        cultures and rights. Among them there were also academics, for example Lucio
                        Picci (currently professor of Political Economy<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1220">[63]</a>), who was at that time

                        which context. Old websites hold interesting stories on their origins, which
                        are often placed at the intersection of academic research, curiosity in
                        advanced digital technologies (together with aspiration of contributing to
                        them) and mutual human desire of communicating with others. Unibo.it is one

                        that Unibo.it was already active at least in the August of the year before.

                        web materials could be also deduced by consulting the 1993/94 yearbooks,
                        where the importance of AlmaNet is mentioned, as well as the need of
                        adopting emails as a form of communication and online databases as new

                            New!" published a list of the new servers on the web each month
                        (from June 1993 to January 1996)<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1291">[70]</a>.
                        By consulting it, some interesting information about specific sub-sections
                        of Unibo.it was found: for example the "Bologna
                            Astrophysics Preprints" has offered online, since November 1994,
                        all the scientific publications of the Bologna Astronomical Observatory
                        (OAB), the Astronomy Department of Bologna University (DDA), the Radio

                        However, for what concerns specifically the creation date of the website, in
                        December 1993 a link to a map of all Italian web-servers was published, but
                        this link is not available anymore (it redirects to the 1997 version of the

                        as traditional archival sources, we know that Unibo.it was already available
                        in the second half of 1993, and that the website was created after the end

                        using the Internet in their work. For this reason, departments and research
                        centers in computer science<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1301">[71]</a>
                        and physics<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1305">[72]</a>
                        are generally good starting points for discovering who created the website
                        of a specific institution. However, in Bologna, the university website was
                        created in a different place, namely at the Department of Mathematics,
                        thanks to the collaboration between a Turkish professor who had at that time
                        arrived from the United States, and a young Italian researcher.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p58">58</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p58">The story of the origins of Unibo.it emerged in an interview conducted with
                        Renzo Davoli. Davoli is currently professor of Computer Science at the
                        University of Bologna; in the early 90s he was working under the supervision
                        of Ozalp Babaoglu, who arrived in Bologna in 1988 from Cornell University
                        and wanted to use the Internet – among other things – to stay in touch with
                        his colleagues and friends from abroad. Given the fact that Bologna did not
                        have a Department of Computer Science at that time, Babaoglu and Davoli were
                        working at the Department of Mathematics. In 1988 the two of them
                        established the second Italian node to the Internet<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1312">[73]</a>, from the Department of
                        Mathematics to CNUCE, in Pisa<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1318">[74]</a> and
                        Davoli became the person in charge of the University TCP/IP network. They
                        then became part of AlmaNet, the internal network initially established
                        between the Departments of Mathematics, Engineering and Physics. In the
                        following years, AlmaNet played an essential role in connecting university
                        departments, especially the ones located outside the city.</div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p59">59</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p59">Interactions between the departments were again improved thanks to the advent
                        of the World Wide Web. Departments were the first to be online and, once
                        again, this was accomplished thanks to Babaouglu and Davoli. As a matter of
                        fact, in July 1993, the two researchers registered and created the web pages
                        of the domains "cs.unibo.it" (Computer Science) and "dm.unibo.it"
                        (Department of Mathematics). This helped colleagues in other departments
                        understand the huge potential of the web. Initially, Davoli and Babaoglu
                        managed the main website as well, which then passed under the supervision of
                        the Public Relation Office, and in particular of Salvatore

                <h1 class="head">Working with the Internet Archive</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p60">60</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p60">In the previous sections, it has been highlighted how the digital past of an
                    institution could be re-discovered without the prompt availability of Internet
                    Archive snapshots. The following paragraphs will describe the work I conducted,
                    for understanding why Unibo.it was excluded from the Wayback Machine.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p61">61</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p61">In order to understand the reasons of the removal of Unibo.it, the first step was
                    to find, in the exclusion-policy of the Internet Archive, information related to
                    the message "This URL has been excluded from the Wayback Machine", which
                    appeared when "http://www.unibo.it" was searched. As described in the FAQ
                    section of the Internet Archive, the most common reason for this exclusion is
                    when a website explicitly requests to not be crawled by adding "User-agent:
                        ia_archiver Disallow: /" to its robots.txt file<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1358">[76]</a>. However, it is also explained that
                        "Sometimes a website owner will contact us directly and
                        ask us to stop crawling or archiving a site, and we endeavor to comply with
                        these requests. When you come across a 'blocked site error' message
                        that means that a site owner has made such a request and it has been
                        honored. Currently there is no way to exclude only a portion of a site, or
                        to exclude archiving a site for a particular time period only. When a URL
                        has been excluded at direct owner request from being archived, that
                        exclusion is retroactive and permanent".</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p62">62</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p62">When a website has not been archived due to robots.txt limitations, a specific
                    message is displayed: "Page cannot be crawled or displayed
                        due to robots.txt", which is different from the one that appeared
                    when searching the University of Bologna website (as shown in Figure 6).
                    Therefore, the only possible conclusion is that someone had explicitly requested
                    to remove the University of Bologna website from the Archive.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p63">63</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p63">Before moving on, it is essential to mention that, when a website is excluded due
                    to robots.txt, its pages are not preserved by the Internet Archive. In the
                    second situation, as it will be presented in the next paragraphs, it was instead
                    discovered that the Internet Archive has continued to preserve the website
                    (despite what is described in the FAQ section), which was simply not available
                    for any kind of consultation through the Wayback Machine. Given the specificity
                    of the exclusion message, I decided to consult CeSIA, the team that has
                    supervised Unibo.it during the last decades, regarding this issue. However, they
                    did not submit any removal-request to the Internet Archive and they were not
                    aware nor had any trace in digital and archival documents of anyone submitting
                    it. To clarify this issue, the Internet Archive team was then contacted. Thanks
                    to the efforts of Mauro Amico (CeSIA), Raffaele Messuti (AlmaDL - Unibo),
                    Christopher Butler (Internet Archive) and Giovanni Damiola (Internet Archive), a
                    collaboration with the Internet Archive started at the end of March 2015. As we
                    contacted Butler, he told us that the Unibo.it case was similar to another one
                    that involved the New York government websites<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1390">[77]</a>.
                    With their help, I discovered that a removal request regarding the main website
                    and a list of specific subdomains had been submitted to the Internet Archive in
                    April 2002. Thanks to this collaboration, the university website became
                    available again on the Wayback Machine on the 13th of April 2015 (see Figure 7).
                    This also gives us the opportunity of attesting that the Internet Archive has
                    kept preserving Unibo.it in the last fifteen years; the website was simply not
                    available for any consultation. Additionally, having the website at our
                    disposal, once again, gave me the opportunity of re-evaluating the findings of
                    this study.</div>

                    further. As it has already been described, in 2002 the administration of
                    Unibo.it completely changed, during a general re-organization of the digital
                    presence of the university (the Portale d’Ateneo project). Therefore, while it
                    is evident that this request was made by someone who was in the position to ask
                    for the removal of the website<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1407">[78]</a> and who knew how the Internet Archive exclusion policy
                        works<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1413">[79]</a>, it still remains entirely unclear to
                    us who, in that very same month, could have been in the position to submit this
                    specific request, and the reasons behind it. Even though several years have
                    passed by, it was assumed that someone involved in the administration of the
                    website would have remembered (or had traces in a backup) this email exchange
                    with a team of digital archivists in San Francisco. Between April and June 2015
                    a last series of interviews was conducted with several people involved in the
                    Unibo.it website, pre- and post the 2002 reorganization. However, it was
                    impossible to retrieve any information on this issue.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p65">65</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p65">As the specificity of the request is the only hint that could help in identifying
                    its author, I decided to analyze the different urls in more detail. The majority
                    of them are server addresses (identified by "alma.unibo"), while the other
                    pages are subdomains of the main website, for example estero.unibo.it (probably
                    dedicated to international collaborations). A few questions therefore remain
                    unsolved: why would someone want to exclude exactly these pages and not all the
                    department pages, which were active online, at that time? Why exactly these four
                    subdomains were selected and not the digital magazine <cite class="title italic">Alma2000</cite> (<a class="ref" href="http://alma2000.unibo.it" onclick="window.open('http://alma2000.unibo.it'); return false">alma2000.unibo.it</a>) or the e-learning platform (<a class="ref" href="http://www.elearning.unibo.it" onclick="window.open('http://www.elearning.unibo.it'); return false">www.elearning.unibo.it</a>)?</div>

                        role of academic institutions in processes such as nation building as well
                        as on the influence of governments (through economic and political
                        decisions), on the experience and life of students as well as on the
                        relationship of institutions and professional realities. Another topic that
                        has attracted significant attention is the examination of universities as
                        institutions of higher education, where the manner in which topics are
                        taught and education is provided are also highly influenced by several
                        political, economic and social factors.</div>

                        academic institution and understanding the global and local reasons that
                        influenced specific changes is a topic that has attracted the attention of
                        many historians of universities. For example, [<a class="ref" href="#deridder-symoens1992-2011">de Ridder-Symoens 1992-2011</a>], provides a complete overview of
                        the most recurrent teaching topics in European academic institutions and how
                        and why they have changed in the last centuries. Traditionally, historians
                        collect this information by examining different sources, such as student
                        transcript of lessons and professor’s notes<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1453">[80]</a> as well as university
                        yearbooks and the reasons behind widespread adoption of specific textbooks.
                        In recent years, Dan Cohen [<a class="ref" href="#cohen2006">Cohen 2006</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#cohen2011">Cohen 2011</a>] has considered the large and still unexplored
                        potential that online syllabi could offer to the study of academic teaching.
                        The first digital-historical work on the topic has been published in 2005 in
                        the <cite class="title italic">Journal of American History</cite>
                        [<a class="ref" href="#cohen2005">Cohen 2005</a>]. The goal of the paper was to show how the
                        teaching of history in U.S. universities is still strongly based on
                        textbooks. These findings, which are directly in contrast to a round table
                        discussion published in the same journal four years prior [<a class="ref" href="#kornblith2001">Kornblith 2001</a>], were obtained thanks to a large study of
                        around 800 syllabi available on the web.</div>

                        community. During the reconstruction of the past of Unibo.it, it was
                        possible to collect all syllabi published online by the institution, which
                        in the case of the University of Bologna are in the number of thousands for
                        each academic year<a class="noteRef" href="#d40889e1473">[81]</a>. This type of

                        school and department) decided to focus on in its educational programs.

                    approach employed in order to reconstruct its website (which has been excluded
                    for the last thirteen years from the Wayback Machine). In doing so, the paper
                    underlined how its history is divided into two parts (before and after the

                    useful to improve our knowledge on the metamorphosis of this website

                    of new ways of conceiving the retrieval, analysis, criticism and employment of
                    born digital primary sources. As historians, we should openly join this
                    discussion with both theoretical contributions as well as concrete examples. As
                    a matter of fact, these materials will sustain traditional historical research
                    questions and will lead to an infinite number of new ones.</div>
