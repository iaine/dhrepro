                <p> This paper approaches <cite class="title italic">Corinne, ou l'Italie</cite> through
                    an inter-disciplinary lens, drawing on literary, historical, and digital
                    methodologies. If <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite> is first and foremost a
                    Romantic novel that foregrounds the love plot between Corinne and Oswald, it is
                    as much a novel about the role of women in society, articulated through the
                    figure of the <span class="foreign i">femme de génie</span>. The plot of the
                        <span class="foreign i">femme de génie</span> finds its expression through
                    the trope of sociability, which I analyze through a social network analysis of
                    the characters in the narrative and a computational analysis of collocates. I
                    argue that through the constellation of sociability in the novel and the
                    national allegories that accompany it, Staël evokes an enduring partiality for
                    an Enlightenment ideal of sociability that remains deeply connected with female
                    emancipation. The lens of sociability thus allows for a re-articulation of the
                    novel as a social critique of patriarchal society. </p>

                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The salon is considered the milieu of sociability <span class="foreign i">par
                        excellence</span> in eighteenth-century France, and carries with it
                    mythic associations as an incubator of literary and philosophical discourse.
                    Women, for the most part, governed these spaces of mediation between the
                        <span class="foreign i">gens de lettres</span> and the <span class="foreign i">gens du monde</span>, which allowed for the formation of
                    networks of <span class="foreign i">philosophes</span>, writers, historians,
                    economists, politicians, and aristocrats. Whether the salon served as a motor of
                    the Enlightenment or rather as a place of aristocratic divertissement, the
                    Enlightenment ideal of a vibrant, mixed-gendered salon that thrives on
                    intellectual and literary exchange is precisely the mode of sociability that
                    Madame de Staël championed, both in theory and in practice.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e199">[1]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Staël inhabited a complex historical position between the Enlightenment and
                    post-revolutionary France. She remained firmly attached not only to the ideas of
                    the Enlightenment, but also to the aristocratic culture of the <span class="foreign i">ancien régime</span>, as evidenced by her desire to
                    repurpose Enlightenment practices of sociability after the Revolution [<a class="ref" href="#baczko2008">Baczko 2008</a>]. The society that Staël assembled at the château de
                    Coppet during her time in exile constituted an alternative to the state-run
                    institutions of the 19<span class="hi superscript">th</span> century that formally
                    excluded the participation of women, institutions intended to replace the salon
                    of the <span class="foreign i">ancien régime</span>
                    [<a class="ref" href="#hesse2001">Hesse 2001</a>, 111]. Staël’s mastery of the 18<span class="hi superscript">th</span>-century salon allowed her to expand her
                    sociocultural influence from a Parisian salon in the years leading up to the
                    Revolution to a bastion of intellectual exchange at Coppet, where she
                    perpetuated Enlightenment modes of sociability and fostered female and male
                    intellectual collaboration. Coppet was a place of literary, philosophical and
                    political exchange that occurred between nations as well as across disciplines.
                    It became such a powerful center of influence that Stendhal will refer to Coppet
                    as having been "The Estates General of Europe"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#gray2008">Gray 2008</a>, 221].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">A significant amount of the scholarship on Staël takes either a literary or a
                    historical approach. For literary historians, Staël is not only a pioneer of
                    French Romanticism, but she is also an early feminist figure who addresses
                    singularly female conflicts in her theoretical and literary works.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e233">[2]</a> Many
                    studies focus on Staël’s biography, from her precocious childhood in Madame
                    Necker’s salon to her own salon on rue du Bac in the years leading up to the
                    Revolution, her efforts to create safe havens abroad for endangered aristocrats
                    during the Terror, the exile and censorship she faced under Napoleon, and her
                    intellectual circle at Coppet.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e244">[3]</a> Scholars particularly underscore Staël’s
                    influence in the world of letters and in public affairs on an international
                    level. Recent studies have turned to her role in forging a network that fostered
                    new thought through the exchange of ideas between thinkers from diverse nations,
                    granting Staël a central role in the narrative of European cosmopolitanism that
                    while strong during the Enlightenment, would profoundly mark 19<span class="hi superscript">th</span>-century intellectual production.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e275">[4]</a>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">In line with the continued interest in Staël’s practices of sociability, her
                    Enlightenment heritage, and her feminist critique of society, this paper
                    demonstrates how these preoccupations intersect in her novel <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite>. I combine more traditional literary and
                    historical methods with – for the first time – digital methodologies to examine
                    the trope of Enlightenment sociability in the novel. Sociability was far more
                    than a cultural practice for Staël; it constituted a key component of Staël’s
                    political thought. For Staël, the salon was essential in affording women a role
                    in public life. What’s more, as Steven Kale notes, Staël considered the salon to
                    be "the crucible of an enlightened politics, where
                            aristocrats and intellectuals came together to consummate the marriage
                            of politics and philosophy"

                    that Staël cultivated in her own circles finds its manifest expression in her
                    novel <cite class="title italic">Corinne, ou l’Italie</cite>. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">While Staël’s literary work is often discussed in relation to the establishment
                    of a Romantic topos, the influence of the Enlightenment on her work and her
                    continued faith in <span class="foreign i">les lumières</span> ought not to be
                        eclipsed.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e323">[6]</a>
                    Staël draws on a variety of influences, not only German philosophy and English
                    proto-romanticism, but also ideas from the French Enlightenment, which
                    synthesize into a distinct <span class="foreign i">pensée staëlienne</span>
                    that can be traced throughout her literary and philosophical works [<a class="ref" href="#monchoux1970">Monchoux 1970</a>, 372]. If <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite>
                    is first and foremost a Romantic novel that foregrounds the love plot between
                    Corinne and Oswald, it is as much a novel about the role of women in society,
                    articulated through the figure of the <span class="foreign i">femme de
                        génie</span>. The social conflicts that plague Corinne as a result of her
                    talents and emancipated lifestyle are entangled within the amatory intrigue,
                    which has led scholars to suggest that <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite>
                    "n’est pas un roman d’amour, mais l’amour y est
                            constamment essentiel"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#vaillant2000">Vaillant 2000</a>, 57].<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e358">[7]</a> The novel can be
                    read as having two plots: the love plot, which allows for the development of
                    Romantic tropes – passion, suffering, the sublime experience of nature and
                    ruins, melancholia, to name a few – and the plot of the <span class="foreign i">femme de génie</span>. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">The plot of the <span class="foreign i">femme de génie</span> is a fundamental
                    component of the <span class="foreign i">pensée staëlienne</span>, finding its
                    expression in <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite> through the trope of
                    sociability. What’s more, Staël’s allegorical use of nations in the novel serves
                    to qualify the cultural conditions of possibility for this ideal sociability,
                    contrasting a modern model of gender relations and female autonomy in Italy with
                    the more archaic mores represented by British society in <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite>. In this paper, I argue that through the constellation of
                    sociability in <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite> and the national allegories
                    that accompany it, Staël evokes an enduring partiality for an Enlightenment
                    ideal of sociability that remains deeply connected with female emancipation. The
                    lens of sociability allows for a re-articulation of the novel as a social
                    critique of patriarchal society in juxtaposition with an alternative,
                    enlightened social model.</div>

                    interactions between characters [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2011">Moretti 2011</a>, 81]. Network
                    theory allows us to quantify plot and create models of literary texts. As Franco
                    Moretti demonstrates, a networks approach to literature can be useful in several
                    ways. One major change introduced by networks is the way in which they make
                    visible all aspects of a plot at once. Networks reveal underlying structures in
                    the process of reducing and abstracting the narrative. By creating models of a
                    text, scholars can also intervene on the model and experiment, rethinking the
                    hierarchy of characters and their centrality [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2011">Moretti 2011</a>, 81–86]. As Moretti notes, removing the protagonist can reveal a
                    completely altered network of the same text, and peripheral characters can point
                    to subplots [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2011">Moretti 2011</a>, 91]. Furthermore, as Andrew Piper,
                    Syed Ahmed, Faiyaz Al-Zamal, and Derek Ruths suggest, the study of character
                    networks in literature offers a way to study not only types and themes, they
                    also "afford us the ability to understand the social
                            imaginings of writers, periods, and genres"

                    in plays, the interactions between characters can be easily quantified based on
                    speech acts, translating character interactions computationally in a novel is
                    not self-evident [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2011">Moretti 2011</a>]. Scholars have approached this
                    issue in a variety of ways. Some build their networks based on concrete
                    interaction between characters that requires "active co-presence"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#piper">Piper et al. forthcoming</a>]. For others, dialogue interactions suffice: Elson et al. construct
                    networks relying on character name chunking and quoted speech attribution [<a class="ref" href="#elson2010">Elson et al. 2010</a>]. It is important however to distinguish between
                    interactions and observations by characters about others [<a class="ref" href="#agarwal2012">Agarwal et al. 2012</a>]. Apoorv Agarwal, Augusto Corvalan, Jacob Jensen, and
                    Owen Rambow conducted network analysis based on concrete interactions between
                    characters, or, instances of observation where one character is thinking of or
                    talking about another character. They also point to the suitability of different

                    The more frequently this occurs, the stronger the interaction, thus the edge
                    between the characters in the network has a higher weight. This is closest to
                    Agarwal et al.’s approach in that it takes into account not only instances of

                    whether or not the network is slanted more towards physical interaction or
                    towards abstract interaction. For instance, Oswald and Corinne, the two

                    another, while other secondary characters only appear in physical interactions

                    prior the countries of interest) versus how many times they would be expected to
                    occur if equally distributed throughout the novel. As I will demonstrate, the
                    collocate-analysis allows for a qualification of the tensions that underlie the

                    an overwhelming majority of interactions between Corinne and Oswald. This is
                    unsurprising considering the lengthy portions of the narrative involving only
                    these two characters. The love triangle also occupies a central place in the

                    the end of the novel, Oswald is constantly comparing the two women as he is torn

                    describes her dwelling as "un mélange heureux de tout ce qu’il y avait de plus

                    individuals every evening. The first occurrence of this follows Corinne’s public
                    oratory, and the conversation centers on Corinne’s talent for improvisation and
                    Italian poetry (C82). The most extensive scene of sociability occurs in Book
                    VII, in which Corinne, Lord Nelvil, the prince Castel-Forte, the comte
                    d’Erfeuil, and M. Edgermond engage in a lively debate over poetry, prose, and
                    theater. Corinne speaks at length of Dante, Petrarch, Cesarotti, Ossian,
                    Machiavelli, and Boccaccio. When discussing French literature, the comte
                    d’Erfeuil refers to the literature under Louis XIV as the "perfect models" of prose, citing Bossuet, Montesquieu, Buffon, and
                    La Bruyère (C176). They discuss classical theater and the English claim to
                    theatrical glory, Shakespeare. Through Corinne’s character, Staël articulates
                    theories of literature and engages in comparisons of national literatures.
                    Corinne even echoes the philosophy of literature expressed in Staël’s treatise

                    sociability that fosters intellectual and literary exchange. In this sense,
                    Corinne represents the literary node in this network of sociability, and the
                    core group of her acquaintances is composed of aristocratic men from different
                    European nations. The characters in this network thus reconstruct an archetypal
                    space of 18<span class="hi superscript">th</span>-century sociability in which a
                    distinguished woman assembles a society comprised of a majority of male
                        attendees.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e668">[14]</a> While they are not men of letters per se, they exemplify the
                    Enlightenment culture of intellectual participation. As Dan Edelstein notes, the
                    Enlightenment depended on much more than simply "[penning] a
                        treatise," instead, the interaction between <span class="foreign i">gens de lettres </span> and <span class="foreign i">gens du monde
                    </span> in the salons served as a precondition of the Enlightenment’s
                    existence [<a class="ref" href="#edelstein2010">Edelstein 2010</a>, 13]. This small network of
                    sociability thereby reflects on a micro scale the social composition of the
                    French Enlightenment, which was highly aristocratic, literary, and
                    male-dominated, barring certain exceptional women who established hubs of power
                    in the world of letters through practices of sociability.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e683">[15]</a>

                    Enlightenment and exemplifies an ideal of sociability. If Staël succeeds in
                    making this ideal a reality at Coppet, she transposes Coppet’s model of
                    cosmopolitan sociability into fiction in <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite>.
                    Corinne incarnates the autonomous <cite class="title italic">femme de lettres</cite>
                    who enjoys an eminent position in society as a result of her literary and
                    artistic gifts, and her capacity to cultivate a rich circle of sociability. She
                    unites a myriad of languages, arts, literary genres, and people in a utopian
                    exchange. The "<span class="foreign i">Amis</span>" network in the novel
                    thus represents a modern schema of male and female relations that centers around
                    female intellectual agency and is conducive to female autonomy. The notion of a
                    distinctly modern ethos is further developed through Staël’s symbolic treatment
                    of the various nations in the novel, which the collocate-analysis underscores.

                    reality, arguing that Staël’s cultural portraits perpetuate stereotypes.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e727">[16]</a> This interpretation, however, ignores the strategic purpose of
                    these portrayals of nations in the tradition of Voltaire and Montesquieu, a
                    technique used for social critique rather than historical accuracy.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e739">[17]</a> Many studies point to
                    the politicization of the novel through these national representations,
                    suggesting that Staël obliquely challenges Napoleon’s power by opposing literary
                    arts to military spirit, idealizing a nation conquered by Napoleon, and
                    characterizing the French in an unfavorably frivolous light.<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e748">[18]</a>
                    What Staël critiques in <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite>, however, extends
                    beyond Napoleon, to the status of women and the possibilities afforded to them.
                    Staël portrays Italy as a utopia, free from the social constraints of
                    patriarchal societies. Michel Delon associates the social freedom in this
                    idealized Italy with the ancient Roman traditions of public oratory and poetic
                    creation in the novel [<a class="ref" href="#delon2008">Delon 2008</a>]. I argue, however, that the
                    classical motif rather affords a theatricalized setting for a mode of
                    sociability that, by contrast, is not reminiscent of ancient Rome but rather
                    reminiscent of the <span class="foreign i">ancien régime</span> during the

                    the opposition between an ideal of Enlightenment sociability conducive to female
                    emancipation and another form of society that precludes this. The comparative
                    framework allows Staël to address the condition of women in different social
                    contexts, specifically the issue of the social conditions that allow women to
                    enjoy intellectual agency. This is a topic that Staël actively engages with in
                    her theoretical works, particularly with respect to post-revolutionary society.
                    The heightened climate of misogyny in France after the revolution is something

                    collocate of the most frequency is in fact, Italy, seconded by "French,"
                    "accent," and "reputation." A comparative framework effectively runs
                    through the novel; Oswald compares Corinne to Lucile, Italy to England, and the
                    other main characters engage in this same comparative activity. The collocate
                        "French" points to the motif of national comparisons. "Accent"
                    follows suit; one’s accent serves as a signifier of nationality. Upon his first
                    interaction with Corinne, Oswald is shocked to hear Corinne speak English "avec ce pur accent national, ce pur accent insulaire qui
                        presque jamais ne peut être imité sur le continent," for he is
                    unaware of her English origins (C68).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e973">[25]</a>
                    This association is reinforced when Corinne speaks French with an English
                    accent, which perplexes Oswald and the comte d’Erfeuil at this point in the

                    time spent away from England. The high frequency of "<span class="foreign i">patrie</span>" points to the centrality of the motif of being
                    tied to one’s nation and its social values. "Reputation" appears to be the
                    most significant non-comparative collocate for England. Social mores, which
                    determine reputation, constitute the primary obstacle to the love plot and

                    nations. Italy also has collocates that signal the topics that are important in
                    the narrator’s discussions of the two nationalities: society, marriage,
                    characters, and social mores. Yet overall, the kinds of collocates are markedly

                    Staël ascribes to Italy, which has more to do with her allegorical use of Italy
                    than a social reality. There are also words from the semantic field of the

                    in which Italy symbolizes a place that allows literary and artistic genius to
                    flourish. “Imagination” is also significant because while it occurs 218 times in
                    the novel in a multitude of contexts, it remains specifically one of Italy’s
                    highest collocates. These collocates accentuate the comparative framework of the
                    novel and contribute to the framing of Italy as the only nation in which

                    which I argue serves as a broader metaphor for female emancipation. Corinne
                    represents a figure of literary and artistic genius; she is introduced as a
                    woman who unites, "l’imagination, les tableaux, la vie

                    her apartment discussing literature (C173). These are the very qualities for
                    that matter, which solidify Oswald’s father’s disapproval of her. When she
                    reveals to Oswald that their fathers had entertained the idea of their marriage,
                    she describes her behavior during her encounter with lord Nelvil, "mon esprit, longtemps contenu, fut peut-être trop vif en

                        femmes est le plus ménagé," pointing to the possibility in Italy of
                    love independent of the institution of marriage (C163).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1094">[30]</a> Corinne also emphasizes that Italy is conducive to
                    “une sorte de libéralité, non dans les idées, mais dans les habitudes qui fait
                    de Rome le séjour le plus agréable pour tous ceux qui n’ont plus ni l’ambition,
                    ni la possibilité de jouer un rôle dans le monde” (C161).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1099">[31]</a> What this statement gestures towards is the question of
                    institutional recognition and influence, a key issue for women in the early
                        19<span class="hi superscript">th</span> century since women were largely excluded
                    from institutions in society. Staël presents Italy, however, as an oasis of
                    social mobility where individuals benefit from an exceptional freedom in both
                    the private and public spheres, affording women an emancipated lifestyle.
                    Corinne endeavors to explain to Oswald the possibilities for women in Italian
                    society that diverge greatly from his ideals of domesticity: <blockquote><p>"parmi celles qui sont instruites, vous en verrez
                            qui sont professeurs dans les académies, et donnent des leçons
                            publiquement en écharpe noire; et si vous avisiez de rire de cela, l’on
                            vous répondrait: <span class="hi italic">Y a-t-il du mal à savoir le grec?
                                y-a-t-il du mal à gagner sa vie par son travail? Pourquoi riez-vous
                                donc d’une chose aussi simple?</span>"<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1113">[32]</a>(C162)</p></blockquote> The
                    italicized portion of Corinne’s letter to Oswald underlines the socio-political
                    weight that these words convey, insisting that women being erudite and holding
                    institutional positions in society ought to be self-evident and commonplace. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p33">33</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p33"> The tension between these two social codes and the way in which they
                    respectively sanction or constrict the possibilities for women to develop their
                    autonomous intellectual existence is reinforced by England’s collocate
                        "reputation." Given the "<em class="emph">empire</em>" that public opinion
                    holds over Oswald, the close association between England and "reputation"
                    would seem to reflect Oswald’s preoccupation with the social mores of his
                    country (C243). "Reputation", however, is primarily discussed in relation
                    to the question of female reputation, and assumes a dual meaning for Corinne
                    that accentuates the irreconcilability between the social values that Italy and
                    England each represent. In Italy, Corinne’s reputation carries only positive
                    connotations, "je suis venue m’établir à Rome, ma réputation
                        s’est accrue" (C386).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1141">[33]</a> It is universally acknowledged, even by Lady
                    Edgermond in the end, that Corinne "jouit… d’une très grande
                        réputation littéraire," a reputation for which she is publically
                    known by the people of Italy (C506; C348).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1149">[34]</a> Yet
                    her reputation as a woman is also characterized as precarious with respect to
                    her interactions with Oswald, as something to be imprudently "risked" and "endangered"
                    (C477, 279). Oswald experiences similar concerns, recognizing "qu’il la perdait à jamais de réputation" with any plan
                    to bring Corinne with him to England out of wedlock (C411).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1164">[35]</a> What’s more, the reputation she acquires
                    through her faculties in Italy takes a decidedly negative valence in England,
                    causing Lady Edgermond to worry about the possibility that Corinne’s "extraordinary" reputation may harm her daughter’s
                    chances at securing a promising future establishment (C383).</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p34">34</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p34">The portrayal of Italy as the beacon of female emancipation and England as a
                    paradigm of misogynistic prudery is accentuated through the jealousy that Oswald
                    experiences during Corinne’s public display of her talents. The narrator signals
                    to the reader in the beginning of the novel that there was nothing "plus contraire aux habitudes et aux opinions d’un Anglais que
                        cette grande publicité donnée à la destinée d’une femme" (C49).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1178">[36]</a> In line with the British social values that Staël
                    paints in <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite>, Oswald’s jealousy is not the
                    product of a rival male character such as the prince Castel-Forte, but rather is
                    derived from the public in general, "il eût voulu que
                        Corinne, timide et réservée comme une Anglaise, possédât cependant pour lui
                        seul son éloquence et son génie" (C192).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1189">[37]</a> Here, the tension between the social values of the
                    two nations is patently manifest. Oswald loves and respects Corinne’s genius,
                    yet he expresses a desire to restrict her talents to the private sphere. The
                    simile "comme une Anglaise" denotes his desire for
                    her to conform to the social mores of England. His adherence to the mores of his
                    nation and his resulting emotional reaction to their transgression speaks to the
                    high frequency collocate of "<span class="foreign i">patrie</span>" which
                    runs through the narrative and reinforces the influence "des

                    Staël’s fictional Italy conducive to this ideal emancipatory sociability, and
                    the patriarchal archaism of British mores, allows Staël to construct a narrative
                    of the plight of the <span class="foreign i">femme de génie</span>. The idea
                    that women are subjugated in nations other than Italy serves as a constant motif
                    throughout the novel. Characters engage in comparison of the two nations as
                    evidenced by each country being the other’s most frequent collocate. Characters
                    remind both Corinne and Oswald of how unhappy she would be outside of Italy. The
                    prince Castel-Forte foreshadows the irreconcilability of Corinne’s genius and
                    lifestyle with her love for Oswald, precisely due to his being tethered to
                    British mores: <blockquote><p>"Ses goûts n’ont pas le
                            moindre rapport avec les vôtres. Vous ne vous en apercevrez pas tant
                            qu’il sera sous le charme de votre présence, mais votre empire sur lui

                    Castel-Forte thus anticipates the influence that social pressure and the
                    inculcated British values of female domesticity will wield over Oswald, in the
                    absence of Corinne’s "empire," which depends on the "pouvoir… de son charme" (C397).<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1231">[40]</a> He echoes the
                    aforementioned pull of one’s <span class="foreign i">patrie</span>. The love

                    in the <span class="foreign i">femme de génie</span> plot. The novel begins by
                    revealing Corinne in all of her brilliance and celebrity. She arrives at the
                    Capitol in Rome for her public oration in a horse-drawn carriage. Roman poets
                    read sonnets and odes to her, exalting her imagination before she begins her
                    improvisation (C56). Her words are followed by outbursts of applause from the
                    entire assembly, and the Senator crowns her a genius with a laurel wreath
                    (C49-69). Once Corinne meets Oswald, however, the trajectory of the narrative
                    moves from this apogee of glory through her physical, emotional, and
                    intellectual demise as the result of her thwarted romantic hopes. As Gutwirth
                    has shown, the difference produced in Corinne’s character that is produced can
                    be read through the motif of silence, "le silence est une
                        mort… non pas seulement pour Corinne, mais pour tous. Le roman tourne au
                        réquisitoire contre le silence, mais surtout, il explore les conséquences du
                        silence imposé à la femme"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#gutwirth1982">Gutwirth 1982</a>, 431].<a class="noteRef" href="#d7747e1254">[41]</a>
                    Silence functions as the antithesis to empowerment. The national dichotomies
                    accentuate this as Staël engages in a ruthless satire of British domesticity. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">Staël portrays the British female characters as well as the condition of life for
                    women in England in a particularly unfavorable light. When Corinne recounts her

                    dreary and confined domestic life that awaits her as an aristocratic woman in
                    British society, where "une femme était faite pour soigner

                    Corinne portrays England as the place where "ce qui était

                    network of sociability, are thus the qualities that make Corinne unwelcome in
                    England. Corinne, unable to extinguish her imagination, remarks on how her
                    talent ostracized her from British society, "je n’y faisais

                    the paradox that results from this satire of British women is that Corinne too
                    will be silenced, "La Sibylle ne rend plus d’oracles; son

                    a fundamentally modern form of female emancipation. While the romantic intrigue
                    in <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite> occupies the majority of the narrative,
                    the lens of sociability allows a re-oriented focus onto the co-existing <span class="foreign i">femme de génie</span> plot. The motif of female genius and
                    its social conditions of possibility is central to the novel, and critical for
                    tracing the <span class="foreign i">fil rouge</span> of staëlian philosophy.
                    Staël reveals her enduring partiality for the Enlightenment ideal of sociability
                    that allowed women to exert substantial influence in the world of letters and
                    construct a hub of power in society. For Staël, this model of female and male
                    collaboration remains firmly attached to Enlightenment ideals, a mode of
                    sociability that flourishes in Corinne’s milieu in Italy, yet is irreconciliable
                    with the conventional social mores embodied by England that come to dominate the

                    sociability is in its representation of literary and artistic genius through a

                    sociability in <cite class="title italic">Corinne</cite> conducive to female
                    intellectual ambition reflects the model that Staël constructs at Coppet through

                    practices. The network of sociability in the novel thus embodies a distinctly
                    modern paragon of female and male relations that allow for female emancipation
