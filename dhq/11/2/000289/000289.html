                <p>We propose that network visualization is a digital humanities method that can
                        "explore" and "negotiate" the space
                    between text and performance in the study of Shakespeare. The networks developed
                    in this project use the language of Shakespearean plays to trace the
                    relationships between characters in space, in effect, translating the literary
                    text into a web of spatial relations, which are difficult to perceive solely in
                    the act of reading. Our analysis presents a particular method of network
                    visualization, and also demonstrates how this technique can be used as a
                    critical tool to revise our understanding of social disorder in Shakespearean
                    tragedy. We therefore propose a dual scope for this paper. At a methodological
                    level, we argue that network visualization is a way to infer staging and the
                        "blocking" of theatrical space from the language of the
                    playtext. In our case study, we show how this technique can be used as a form of
                    Shakespearean literary criticism deploying this method to reframe the larger
                    question of social disorder in his tragedies. The network visualizations used in
                    this analysis serve as a stable and reproducible way, beyond any single
                    performance, to delineate how the language of Shakespeare’s plays structures the
                    relationships of characters in space. This study represents the beginning of a
                    digital method that aims to bridge text and performance in the study of
                    Shakespeare by reading the dramatic text for the linguistic codes that organize
                    the space of the stage.</p>

                        significantly. Was it, perhaps, potentially a site in which cultural
                        difference between imaginary representations and physicality in performance
                        could be presented, explored, negotiated, released, or otherwise delivered?

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1"> Robert Weimann has suggested that bridging the "discontinuous" space between the literary text and the theatrical
                    performance would require us to reimagine the gap between the two media as a
                    productive site of cultural "negotiation," rather
                    than an irreconcilable methodological divide [<a class="ref" href="#weimann1999">Weimann 1999</a>, 427]. In this essay, we offer a response to Weimann’s theoretical
                    proposal, by arguing that network visualization gives us the specific tools to
                        "explore" and to "negotiate" the space
                    between text and performance in the study of Shakespearean drama. In this
                    approach, digital humanities techniques serve as a way to link traditionally
                    different modes of aesthetic engagement, such as, in the case of Shakespeare,
                    reading his plays as literary texts or performing them on stage. The networks
                    developed in this project use the language of Shakespearean playtexts to trace
                    the relationships between characters in space, in effect, translating the
                    literary text into a web of spatial relations, which are difficult to perceive
                    solely in the act of reading. Our analysis presents a particular method of
                    network visualization, and also demonstrates how this technique can be used as a
                    critical tool to revise our understanding of social disorder in Shakespearean
                    tragedy. We therefore propose a dual scope for this paper. At a methodological
                    level, we argue that network visualization is a way to infer staging and the
                        "blocking" of theatrical space from the language of the
                    playtext. In our case study, we show how this technique can be used as a form of
                    Shakespearean literary criticism deploying this method to reframe the larger
                    question of social disorder in his tragedies.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">Our network visualizations quantify from the beginning to the end of each scene
                    in Shakespeare’s thirty-seven plays the number of words and lines spoken by each
                    character, which characters interact by responding to one another (i.e. if
                    character A speaks, and character B replies, the program counts this as a
                    reciprocal exchange of language) and how frequently the two characters interact
                    by this response mechanism. Here we have adapted Emma Pierson’s counting method,
                    which measures network interaction by "counting the number of lines of A spoken immediately
                            after B, and vice versa, and summing them"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#pierson2014">Pierson 2014</a>]. This logic defines interaction in terms of dialogic response: if two
                    characters are adjacent in the playtext, our program measures this as a proxy
                    for a reciprocal linguistic exchange. To validate our method, we will compare
                    the network diagrams to actual performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company to
                    show that the density or sparseness of each play’s network, and the proximity
                    and distance of the characters composing that network, correspond to the
                    positioning and arrangement of the actors’ bodies on stage. This homology
                    between the network and the embodied performance is logical because each
                    character’s speech structures their relationship to others, and frames their
                    physical interaction in the space of the stage. There are, of course, exceptions
                    to this trend (dumbshows, asides, and eavesdropping scenes are some of the
                    obvious examples), and the network can by no means function as an exact template
                    for a performance. However, the network visualizations used in this analysis
                    serve as a stable and reproducible way, beyond any single performance, to
                    delineate how the language of Shakespeare’s plays structures the relationships
                    of characters in space.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3"> The networks lead us to a new vantage point on Shakespeare’s dramatic art,
                    allowing us to revise a longstanding view that his plays draw their power from
                    the subversive portrayal of social disorder, either in the form of the
                    carnivalesque or as the "conflict and waste" of
                    tragic violence. The network visualizations reveal a new, more subtle logic of
                    enantiosis, or <span class="foreign i">discordia concors</span>, which
                    requires the building of dense social networks on stage as a performance
                    strategy representing a disordering of the social in the plot. Shakespeare’s
                    plays bind characters into a social network in space so as to break apart the
                    social order. This is important because it complicates contemporary network
                    theories that define the social network as an array of positive relationships
                    bound by affiliations or affinities – for instance, the friends or family in a
                    social media network. Our network analysis of the tragedies adds a level of
                    historical nuance to our understanding of social network structure, by showing
                    how Shakespeare builds the densest social networks at precisely the moments
                    where the social order is being destroyed. In Shakespeare’s tragic social
                    networks, then, <em class="emph">making</em> a network link between two characters can
                    actually signify the <em class="emph">breaking</em> of a social relationship between
                    them. The network visualization method permits us to see how this
                    counterintuitive performance strategy unfolds by translating the language of the
                    text into an array of character relationships in space. This study represents
                    the beginning of a digital method that aims to bridge text and performance in
                    the study of Shakespeare by reading the dramatic text for the linguistic codes
                    that organize the space of the stage. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4"> The attempt to use digital humanities tools to span the methodological distance
                    between textual criticism and theater studies responds directly to the recent
                    critical project exemplified by Lukas Erne, Patrick Cheney, David Scott Kastan,
                    and Peter Stallybrass, among many others, which has recuperated a vision of
                    Shakespeare as a literary artist, who did not simply write plays for theatrical
                    production, as the commonplace assumption has long held ([<a class="ref" href="#erne2013">Erne 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#cheney2008">Cheney 2008</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kastan2001">Kastan 2001</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#degrazia1993">De Grazia and Stallybrass 1993</a>]). This laudable historical work emphasizing
                    Shakespeare’s literariness has persuasively demonstrated that the playwright was
                    indeed interested in the textual dissemination and afterlife of his works in the
                    marketplace of books and ideas. We intend to affirm and complicate this critical
                    trend by exploring the space between text and performance as a productive site
                    of critical reading in its own right. The word "reading" is used both
                    purposefully and provocatively here, since Shakespeareans have traditionally
                    recognized the limits of reading the plays as only one part of the range of
                    signification made possible by the text. As Gary Taylor, editor of the Oxford
                    editions of Shakespeare’s complete works, famously puts it, "the written text depended upon an unwritten

                    the scope of literary critics. <blockquote><p>

                            ninety percent of the dialogue text can be recovered, with a good degree
                            of accuracy, for most surviving plays of the Elizabethan period, ninety
                            percent of what actually happened on stage in their performance is not
                            to be found in the stage-directions of any manuscript or printed text,
                            or in the occasional descriptions of performances, and illustrations.
                            The actors’ movements, quite apart from their body language, their
                            positioning and grouping (what directors call "blocking") and their
                            business with props, is largely unrecoverable terra incognita.

Ryan Claycomb, to
                    take the most recent example, has argued that dramatic narratives encode their
                    own rules of performance - "they tell us much about their
                        understanding of the relationship between author and production…in short,
                        they tell us how and to what degree we should be reading toward

                    [<a class="ref" href="#claycomb2013">Claycomb 2013</a>, 161]. Claycomb suggests that theatrical
                    performance inheres in the dramatic narrative itself, and so readers can gain
                    some insight into the performance strategies immanent to the play. More
                    specifically in Shakespeare criticism, Robert Weimann has notably claimed, much
                    like Claycomb, that inscribed within the text itself lies "both play and production," or "representational acting and presentational
                            playing"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#weimann2000">Weimann 2000</a>, 420]. Similarly, Michael Goldman considers the text to be a "design for performance,"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#goldman1985">Goldman 1985</a>, 15] while Inga-Stina Ewbank insists that Shakespeare’s text encodes a "'grammar' of the situation…where

                    in Shakespeare criticism is the latter’s emphasis on space and not narrative

                    this turn to theatrical space, argues that the playtext expresses within its

                    space critics such as Lin, Tiffany Stern and Mariko Ichikawa, who employ a
                    materialist method, the Literary Lab fashioned networks as a way to analyze the
                    space structured by the text of <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite>. Networks
                    translate narrative time into space, by representing "a character-system arising out of many

                    our "perception of the plot" by turning the
                    interaction between characters into an array "visible" in space, and not just as the readerly printed text. His
                    use of networks to examine the "character-space"
                    inscribed within the play moves the study of space as the medium linking the

                    defines and constructs the Shakespearean networks differently than the Literary
                    Lab and other existing analyses of literary networks. A scan of previous network
                    methods would be useful here to sharpen the contrast with our own techniques. In
                    his pamphlet, Moretti defines a network as "made of vertices and edges...basically, two characters
                            are linked if some words have passed between them: an interaction is a
                            speech act"

                    evolutionary psychologists makes very different choices in crafting networks of
                    Shakespeare’s plays. The psychologists, Stiller, Nettle, and Dunbar, explain
                    their method as follows: <blockquote><p>
                        The network structure calculations were obtained by
                            treating each speaking character as a node, and deeming two characters
                            to be linked if there was at least one time slice of the play in which
                            both were present (that is, if two characters spoke to each other or
                            were in each other’s presence, then they have a link).

                    </p></blockquote> As Moretti draws a contrast between their two approaches, his networks
                    exclusively use "explicit" data - "some words passed" between characters - as a
                    measurement of social interaction, whereas Stiller, et al. infer "implicit" relationships as well, by using both verbal
                    exchange ("if two characters spoke to each other") or
                    silent proximity on stage (if they "were in each other’s
                        presence") [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2011">Moretti 2011</a>, 3]. More recently, Emma
                    Pierson of the statistical analysis website fivethirtyeight.com attempted to
                    quantify network relationships in Shakespeare’s romances programmatically, and
                    not manually as the previous two studies had done, "by writing a computer program to count how many lines
                            each pair of characters in <cite class="title italic">Romeo and Juliet</cite>
                            spoke to each other"

                    Moretti’s use of "explicit" ties in language is a
                    concrete and specific way to mark interaction, but he admits that "some questionable decisions" were made in the study
                    since he concedes that the "edges" between characters
                        "are not weighted": "when
                        Claudius tells Horatio in the graveyard scene, 'I pray
                            thee, good Horatio, wait upon him', these eight words have in
                        this Figure exactly the same value as the four thousand words exchanged
                        between Hamlet and Horatio"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2011">Moretti 2011</a>, 3]. He acknowledges that this flattening of
                    all linguistic exchanges to "exactly the same value"
                    paints a picture that "can’t be right." Amounting to
                    what he calls the "childhood of network theory...before the
                        stern adulthood of statistics," Moretti recounts a struggle "to find a non-clumsy way to visualize weight" of the
                    speech between characters, and "as a consequence, the
                        networks in (his) study were all made by hand." He adopted this
                    approach to construct his networks since "machine-gathering
                        of the data, essential to large-scale quantification, was not yet a
                        realistic possibility"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2011">Moretti 2011</a>, 10]. The resulting manually constructed
                    networks are based upon a hazy description of what constitutes a "speech act." The measurement of "some words" exchanged between characters defines an imprecise
                    approximation of how language structures the links in the network. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p9">9</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p9"> In the case of the paper by Stiller, et al., the primary advantage of their
                    approach lies in the attempt to include "implicit"
                    stage presence alongside "explicit" spoken language,
                    but as in the case of the Literary Lab’s network analysis, the problem of a lack
                    of weighting arises. Their networks deem "two characters to
                        be linked if there was <em class="emph">at least one</em> time slice of the play in
                        which both were present." The "&gt;1
                        instance" approach treats a single encounter as being identical to
                    many recurring encounters, having the effect of flattening the distinction
                    between strong patterns of interaction and more sporadic ones. Additionally,
                    their study does not weight "implicit" and "explicit" interactions
                    differently: "presence" is determined by "two
                        characters (who) spoke to each other <em class="emph">or</em> were in each other’s
                        presence." The "or" criterion defines explicit linguistic
                    interaction as being equivalent to implicit shared stage presence. This ignores
                    much of the nuance of dramatic performance by eliding the distinctions between
                    different kinds of relationships into a single generic metric of non-specific
                    social bonds.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p10">10</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p10"> In sum, both the Literary Lab and Stiller, et al. encounter problems with how to
                    accurately weight the volume and frequency of interactions (i.e. how do repeated
                    interactions have a greater weight than less frequent ones?) and in how to
                    weight the difference between explicit and implicit interactions (i.e. how do
                    direct linguistic exchanges have a different weight than characters who silently
                    share the stage?). The technical problem of weighting is not exclusive to
                    network analyses of Shakespeare. Hoyt Long and Richard So’s methodology in
                    examining modernist poetic networks "treats every published
                        poem as essentially equal, and thus commits to a flagrant abstraction of the
                        cultural content from which (their) network data is derived." This is
                    a tactical choice on their part, however, because they aim "to identify broader structural patterns"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#long2013">Long and So 2013</a>, 9]. By contrast, Pierson’s quantitative network
                    analysis adds a level of methodological sophistication by attempting to weight
                    interactions by "counting how many lines each pair of
                        characters in <cite class="title italic">Romeo and Juliet</cite> spoke to each
                        other," but her study places a self-imposed limit by focusing
                    exclusively on dyads in Shakespeare’s love stories, and does not consider
                    multivalent relationships between several characters across all of his many
                    plays and numerous genres.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p11">11</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p11"> How can we resolve these problems of accurate weighting in measuring interaction
                    in Shakespeare’s plays? It is important to acknowledge that the strengths and
                    weaknesses of these existing network methods derive from the technical choices
                    these scholars have made in constructing their networks. As Borgatti explains, a
                    central assumption of network theory is that "it is the
                        researcher - by choosing a set of nodes and a type of tie - that defines the
                        network." The choices involved in building a given network "should not generally be regarded as an empirical question.
                        Rather it should be dictated by the research question and one’s explanatory
                        theory." This necessary logic of selection stems from the fact that
                        "in contrast to groups, networks do not have
                            'natural' boundaries," and are artificial
                    abstractions used to visualize complex systems [<a class="ref" href="#borgatti2011">Borgatti 2011</a>, 2].<a class="noteRef" href="#d6404e618">[2]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p12">12</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p12"> With this proviso in mind that the investigator’s methodological choices
                    governed by an explanatory theory inflect the structure of the network, our
                    network analysis uses actor-network-theory (ANT) as a theoretical framework
                    organizing our methodological decisions. ANT gives us a useful working
                    vocabulary to define our networks, and is the most robust network paradigm
                    dominant in the humanities, social sciences, and in business and organizational
                    studies today that specifically adopts linguistic exchanges as the medium of
                    social interaction composing the network’s structure. ANT is additionally useful
                    for literary criticism since it unabashedly places theatrical and literary
                    metaphors such as "actor,"
                    "performance,"
                    "stage," and "narrative" at the center of their definition of how
                    networks constitute the social.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6404e637">[3]</a> ANT defines a network as a social structure created by a
                    lattice of intersubjective communication. According to Bruno Latour and John
                    Law, the form of the network maps the circulation of social energy by tracing
                    the movement of language between "actors" in space,
                    in a process called "translation." The network thus
                    offers to us a model of the social that does not rely on the ordered
                    arrangements of hierarchies, institutions, ranks, categories, or taxonomies. ANT
                    describes the social order in a seemingly chaotic, unordered way, where the
                    linguistic transactions between actors in the network empirically determine the
                    nature of the social structure in the first place, without any formal, <span class="foreign i">a priori</span> presupposition of what the social
                    organization should look like. Thus, if conceptualized in the form of the
                    network, our introduction to the fractured political world of Elsinore looks
                    something like this (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>).</div>

                    relationships by inferring spatial and linguistic interactions between
                    characters, and would have to figure out for themselves the tensions and
                    allegiances driving the play’s plot. By contrast, modern text editions, such as
                    the Oxford Shakespeare shown in <a href="#figure02">Figure 2</a>, provide
                    the reader with a neat organization classified by rank, nationality, gender,
                    heredity, or among other rubrics, in the form of a cast of characters, which was
                    not provided to Renaissance audiences, or many theatergoers today [<a class="ref" href="#wells2005">Wells and Taylor 2005</a>].</div>

                    relationships visualized in the network are not static. The network captures the
                    ephemeral dynamism of unstable and constantly shifting social vectors. It is
                    defined by its actors and their movements structuring relationships in a web.
                    The actions composing the network involves a range of verbs describing the
                    tracing and writing performed by the actors: "there is an actor whose definition of the world
                            outlines, traces, delineate, limn, describe, shadow forth, inscroll,
                            file, list, record, mark, or tag a trajectory that is called a
                            network"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#latour1996">Latour 1996</a>, 14]. The discourse of texts resulting from these acts compose a network that
                        "renders the movement of the social visible to the
                        reader"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#latour2007">Latour 2007</a>, 128]. The network translates the
                        "movement of the social" into a
                        "visible" form, revealing a social structure determined
                    by intersubjective relationships mediated by language. Central to ANT’s
                    definition of the network is a literalization of the word "actor." Latour
                    attempts to "reactivate" the actor’s theatrical
                    signification as a way to redefine agency in the network [<a class="ref" href="#latour2007">Latour 2007</a>, 46]. Theatrical action is "borrowed, distributed, suggested, influenced, dominated, betrayed,
                        translated" in a constant linguistic negotiation of social energy
                    with other actors and agents in the fictional space of the stage. The collective
                    agency performed on the theatrical stage serves as a useful paradigm for ANT by
                    providing a well-developed model describing how linguistic exchanges between
                    actors in space create a social world in miniature. Our network analysis of
                    Shakespeare’s plays thus enacts a productive cross-talk between theater and the
                    network. ANT has appropriated the technical vocabulary of drama to define its
                        "actors" in space, while we are reciprocally using ANT as a framework
                    to define the space of the stage latent in Shakespearean language.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6404e739">[4]</a> ANT’s
                    articulation of an organic, emergent model of the social in which the linguistic
                    relationships between actors constitute the social structure itself, gives us an
                    alternative technical vocabulary to examine the social organization of
                    Shakespeare’s plays from a different spatial angle. ANT’s stress on linguistic
                    exchange as the basis of defining "actors,"
                    "performance," and the "stage" of the network gives us a specific
                    framework to work with the language of the plays as the medium of social
                    interaction.</div>

                    together also suggests a way to resolve some of the problems of weighting found
                    in the prior network analyses of Shakespeare’s plays and literary works. To
                    address Moretti’s admitted issue of a lack of weighting the volume and frequency
                    of dialogue between characters, we have adapted Pierson’s method of using the
                    number of lines exchanged between speakers as a way to weight different
                    magnitudes of interaction. The result of Pierson’s quantitative weighting of
                    line numbers provides a way to avoid hand-drawn diagrams, and permits the
                    development of a machine-based technique of constructing the play’s networks
                    that Moretti has suggested was not yet possible. This technique defines each
                    line of the play as an "event tie," which is a
                    concept in network theory where connections have a "discrete
                        and transitory nature and can be counted over time...Cumulated over time,
                        event-type ties can be dimensionalized in terms of frequency of
                        occurrence...It is these kinds of ties that researchers have in mind when
                        they define networks as a 'recurring pattern of ties'." ([<a class="ref" href="#borgatti2011">Borgatti 2011</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#dubini1991">Dubini and Aldrich 1991</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#ebers1997">Ebers 1997</a>]) </div>

                    network analyses outlined above. To trace the relationships between characters
                    in all of Shakespeare’s plays, we created the diagrams using the Python library
                    NetworkX, which has been used by scientists to examine complex systems and by
                    social scientists to visualize social media networks. The network visualizations
                    are divided by scene, and not the whole play, which was a shared problem of
                    scale in the networks of Moretti, Stiller, Nettle, and Dunbar, and Pierson. Each
                    network layers four dimensions of textual information into a single
                    visualization: interaction between characters measured by who a speaker directly
                    responds to (the edges between the nodes), frequency of interaction with other
                    characters (the length of the edges between nodes), volume of each character’s
                    speech (the radius of the node), and network density (the number of edges
                    surrounding each character). In developing this definition of "interaction"
                    or "ties" in the program producing the network visualization, we concur
                    with Moretti, and draw from actor-network-theory, by using explicit textual
                    criteria to determine whether "two characters are
                        linked" if "words have passed between
                        them" as a type of "speech act"
                    constituting interaction in the network. Pierson’s counting method also gives us
                    a basic rubric for measuring these linguistically based interactions
                    programmatically (as opposed to manually), by "counting the number of lines of A spoken immediately
                            after B, and vice versa, and summing them"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#pierson2014">Pierson 2014</a>]. This measurement of adjacency and proximity in dialogue directly
                    accounts for <em class="emph">response</em> to a previous speaker as a proxy for
                    reciprocal or mutual ties composing a two-way communication exchange. Here we
                    have attempted to factor in the central distinction in network theory of
                        "strong" versus "weak" ties. Network theorists define
                        "strong" ties as recurrent, direct, mutual, reciprocal relationships
                    and "weak" ties as indirect, uni-directional, faint, or sporadically
                    occurring relationships ([<a class="ref" href="#granovetter1973">Granovetter 1973</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#easley2010">Easley and Kleinberg 2010</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#greteman2015">Greteman 2015</a>]). Network theory uses
                    this distinction to evaluate how the two tiers of interaction have different
                    roles in composing a heterogeneous network structure. Thus, measuring the
                    frequency of lines spoken after a certain character attempts to identify
                        "strong" reciprocal bonds where speakers respond directly to the person
                    speaking before them in the dialogue to engage in a conversation.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p17">17</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p17"> Based on this definition of reciprocal, strong interactions as a response in the
                    dialogue that can be counted as "event ties," the <em class="emph">edges</em>
                    between the nodes in our network diagrams signify each character’s relationship
                    to others, or the characters to whom the character explicitly responds in the
                    text’s language. We measured the <em class="emph">length</em> of the edges between the
                    nodes by calculating the inverse of how frequently a given pair of characters
                    speak to one another - the more they respond to each other in the dialogue, the
                    closer they will be in the network and the edge between them will be
                    proportionally shorter. Using frequency of interaction in the playtext’s
                    language as a metric modulating the distance between speakers’ nodes represents
                    a way to gauge the strength or reciprocity of their relationship by tracking how
                    much they respond to one another. Characters that reply a single time to an
                    interlocutor will be distant, while characters that repeatedly respond to one
                    another will have a more recurrent tie, and the distance between their nodes
                    will be correspondingly shorter. Our method identifying response frequency by
                    measuring adjacent or immediately proximate speech aims to weight the strength
                    or weakness of interactions. This addresses some of the limitations of previous
                    network studies that vaguely considered "some words"
                    passed between characters (in the case of Moretti) or "at
                        least one" interaction (in the case of Stiller, et al.) to create
                    connections that are not precisely scaled to the actual amount of interaction
                    that takes place in the play. Thus our network method does not employ an
                    absolute scale in which any interaction greater than a single occurrence creates
                    an unweighted edge between speakers. Rather, our scalable model modulates the
                    length of the edge between characters’ nodes as a proportion of the number of
                    direct responses between them.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6404e869">[5]</a> To verify these
                    machine-based results, we manually checked all of the scenes included in the
                    analysis to validate that the line response method of measuring interaction
                    accurately reflected the narrative spirit of the scene. The manual verification
                    found an average error rate of 2.56% of misattributed interactions across the
                    tragedies studied in this analysis. Some fairly clear trends emerged among the
                    false interactions that the algorithm struggled to parse. First, when too many
                    characters speak at once, such as when two or more characters respond in
                    sequence to one character’s speech. Take for example when Lodovico and Gratiano
                    both respond to Iago’s vow of silence:</div>
                <blockquote><p class="ptext">Iago: Demand me nothing: what you know, you know: <br/> From
                    this time forth I never will speak word. <br/> Lodovico: What, not to pray?
                    <br/> Gratiano: Torments will ope your lips. (<cite class="title italic">Othello</cite>, 5.2.349-352)</p></blockquote>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p18">18</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p18">Second, the reverse also held true: when one character speaks to several
                    characters at once, such as in Act 1, Scene 5 of <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite> when the Ghost responds to his son by commanding Horatio and
                    Marcellus to "swear" from offstage. This is not a
                    conversation, but in responding to Hamlet, he also directs his imperative to the
                    other two characters. Third, eavesdropping and spying interactions were
                    difficult to account for, with a famous example being Claudius eavesdropping on
                    Hamlet in Act 3, Scene 1. Eavesdropping is a boundary case, because Claudius
                    doesn’t directly engage with Hamlet (i.e. he listens, but they don’t exchange
                    words), but for the sake of accuracy we included these moments. Overall, the
                    manual reading found that characters do indeed predominantly respond to the
                    speaker before them as a general rule shaping Shakespearean dialogue.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19"> The methods described above, and the technical and theoretical choices informing
                    our measurement of interactions between characters in the network diagrams aim
                    to quantify strong ties, or as Moretti puts it, the "explicit" links created by direct verbal address and response. But
                    what about weak or implicit ties, such as being present on stage without
                    directly conversing? The effort to include implicit ties was a strength of the
                    study by Stiller, et al., but their lack of weighting made both explicit
                    linguistic interactions, and implicit spatial ones, equivalent. This assumption
                    of equivalence seems to go against the spirit of dramatic performance, which
                    consciously plays between the two. Our method accounts for these weak ties
                    implicitly by structuring the network visualizations at the scale of the scene
                    and not the whole play, as Moretti, Stiller, Nettle, and Dunbar, and Pierson all
                    chose to do. An aggregate whole-play network makes it difficult to infer who
                    shares the stage with whom at any given point. They are also difficult to
                    interpret since they tend to create, as Nathan Yau puts it, graphs that "in total look hairball-ish," and which are fairly
                    nonspecific in flattening subtle differences between plays, possessing "similar network densities, which suggests similar story
                        structures" across texts [<a class="ref" href="#yau2015">Yau 2015</a>]

                    selected by Shakespeare himself, to interact both explicitly and implicitly in
                    the frame of the stage. The more focused scale of our method inherently limits
                    the number of ties that are possible because only a certain set of characters,
                    determined by the text, can be present on stage during a scene, and all possible
                    connections in that scene can only occur between these characters. By chunking
                    our network visualizations to represent the local narrative context of the
                    scene, and not the macro-level agglomeration of all interactions in the entire
                    play, our networks capture the range of characters who share the narrative space

                    visualizations have two further dimensions. Within the network, we have scaled
                    the <em class="emph">radius</em> of each node according to the number of lines that the
                    character speaks - the larger the node, the more he or she dominates the scene
                    with speech. Calculating the node radius in this way allows us to compare a
                    given character’s volume of speech in general to the volume of speech that is
                    used to communicate with others in the network (represented by the edges). This
                    is a way to measure the total amount of language spoken by a character versus
                    the language defining his position in relation to others. Scaling node radii in
                    this manner expands upon previous network techniques, where nodes were simple

                    characters and their interlocutors, allows us to perceive the network density
                    surrounding each speaker within each scene. Increasing the number of links
                    connecting a character to others, and drawing the edges closer to one another
                    with more frequent reciprocal interactions, create an effect of network density
                    that indicates a high frequency and intensity of network connectedness and
                    social interaction. Scenes with a great deal of interaction will display a dense
                    network of character nodes that are tightly clustered together. Scenes with
                    fewer interactions among characters result in a sparse network with few

                    scenes by constructing aggregate networks for whole plays, flattened the key
                    distinction between strong and weak ties, and did not weight interactions
                    precisely. We propose that our networks learning from these precedents open up a
                    new method using visualization technologies to study a literary or dramatic text
                    from multiple angles simultaneously in a single network diagram. </div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p24">24</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p24"> With the visualization method we have developed, what types of network analysis
                    are made possible? How might other critics use this network technique to find
                    new avenues of research in the study of Shakespearean drama and dramatic
                    literature more generally? In the case study that follows, we demonstrate how
                    the networks constructed by our methodology function as a <em class="emph">critical
                        tool</em> used to evaluate and to test a widely-accepted scholarly
                    consensus on the nature of social order in Shakespeare’s tragedies. Our
                    visualization technique transforms the <em class="emph">idea</em> of social order into
                    actual social networks of Shakespeare’s dramatic world. We use Shakespeare’s
                    social networks created by the interactions within the plays to read the results
                    of the visualizations against the grain of two other methods predominant in
                    Shakespeare studies - close reading and theatrical performance. Reproducing this
                    critical methodology entails independently conducting three levels of analysis
                    in parallel - network visualization, close reading, and the visual analysis of
                    staged performance - in order to test the results of any given approach against
                    the others. Comparing the network graphs with still images from theatrical
                    performances of the plays will demonstrate how the network analysis reveals to
                    the reader some aspect of embodied performance that they could not perceive
                    intuitively through a reading of the text alone. In this way, the network
                    visualization represents the beginnings of a method that will allow us to read
                    between the written playtext and the theatrical performance. Our argument uses
                    the network analysis as a novel way to study both text and performance in a
                    single visualization, which effectively translates Shakespeare’s language into
                    the web of relationships structuring the characters in the space of performance.
                    It focuses our critical gaze on the exchange between the words and bodies that
                    work together to define Shakespearean performance by transmuting the words of
                    the playtext into character relationships in space.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6404e955">[6]</a> If
                    Hammond has asserted that "blocking" or the positioning and grouping of
                    characters in space is "unrecoverable" for the Shakespearean critic, we
                    propose that the network visualizations allow us to imagine such a spatial
                    arrangement. The network analysis does not create a single, inescapable way of
                    staging inherent in the text, but it does offer to us a way to envision how the
                    text structures the character-space that embodied performances ultimately occupy
                    through the decisions of directors and actors. Ultimately, we propose that
                    Shakespeare’s drama must be shown and not exclusively read, but through a
                    visualization method that is fundamentally textual and rooted in the structure
                    of Shakespeare’s language. By aligning Shakespeare’s text and images from staged
                    performances alongside our network diagrams, we suggest that the playtext itself
                    can be used as a template to begin to organize the space of the Shakespearean
                    stage.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p25">25</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p25">Using the network visualizations, we aim to address a live question in the
                    digital humanities today: can computational methods teach us something new about
                    literary texts, or do algorithms and visualizations simply confirm readings,
                    arguments, and theories we already know well? The promise of the network method
                    lies precisely in offering to critics a new vantage point that would otherwise
                    not be possible through a conventional reading of the text. The network allows
                    us to rethink one of the oldest stories in Shakespeare criticism and pedagogy,
                    what we will call the social disorder hypothesis. Since A.C. Bradley
                    influentially defined the essence of Shakespearean tragedy as "division of spirit involving conflict and waste," and
                    not the ultimate reconciliation or renewal suggested by Hegel, generations of
                    critics to the present have described the tragic nature of <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite> in terms of <span class="foreign i">thanatos</span>:
                    confusion, destruction, and violence that violates natural law, ethics, and
                    social order ([<a class="ref" href="#bradley1909">Bradley 1909</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#McAlindon2013">McAlindon 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#heller2005">Heller 2005</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#prendergast2005">Prendergast 2005</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#aebischer2004">Aebischer 2004</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#foakes2003">Foakes 2003</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#danner2003">Danner 2003</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#marshall2002">Marshall 2002</a>]). T.S. Eliot famously
                    describes the violence of the play as an attempt to "express
                        the inexpressibly horrible" that is marred by "excess"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#eliot1998">Eliot 1998</a>, 58–59]. George Santayana describes the play as fundamentally "incoherent" and it represents a confusion or "disarray" of the social world [<a class="ref" href="#santayana1968">Santayana 1968</a>, 145]. More recently, Franco Moretti has
                    inferred from his qualitative, manually drawn network analysis of <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite> that the net effect of Shakespearean tragedy is
                    a "scattering" and a "total
                        disproportion" of social connections. Moretti’s conclusion from the
                    networks simply reconfirms the standard story of tragedy as disorder [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2011">Moretti 2011</a>, 4]. Readers of the comedies have developed a
                    parallel hypothesis on social disorder in accounts of the carnivalesque. Drawing
                    inspiration from the work of Mikhail Bakhtin in <cite class="title italic">Rabelais
                        and his World</cite>, a long tradition of critics has focused on the
                    inversions and disorderings of political and sexual hierarchies opened up in the
                    chaos of Shakespeare's comedies ([<a class="ref" href="#bakhtin1984">Bakhtin 1984</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#goldberg2013">Goldberg 2013</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#pikli2010">Pikli 2010</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#grady2001">Grady 2001</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#knowles1998">Knowles 1998</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gorfain1991">Gorfain 1991</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#bergeron1991">Bergeron 1991</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#wilson1987">Wilson 1987</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#newman1987">Newman 1987</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#kastan1985">Kastan 1985</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#danson1984">Danson 1984</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#bristol1983">Bristol 1983</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#logan1982">Logan 1982</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#berry1972">Berry 1972</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#salingar1976">Salingar 1976</a>]. As Brian Richardson
                    has put it, comedies such as <cite class="title italic">A Midsummer Night’s
                        Dream</cite> perform "the overthrowing of law - in particular, the laws of
                            nature"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#richardson1987">Richardson 1987</a>, 302]. In this story told about Shakespeare, the tragedies and comedies draw
                    their power and enduring interest from the subversive representation of social
                    disorder. For the sake of space, the present argument focuses on Shakespeare’s
                    tragedies, and acknowledges that the comedies and histories require further
                    analysis.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26"> This canonical account of Shakespearean drama as a fictional space for the
                    eruption of disorder severing social bonds and overthrowing political
                    hierarchies certainly holds true at the level of plot, and Act 5, Scene 2 of
                        <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite> is one of the most striking examples of
                    this. However, the critical vocabulary of entropy and chaos - incoherence,
                    conflict, waste, violence, destruction, scattering and disproportion - used to
                    describe tragic plot as the unraveling of society and the destruction of human
                    bonds, fails to capture the dramatic technique required in a performance to
                    represent this "scattering" of the social on stage. The
                    network in Figure 3 demonstrates that scenes of a tragic
                        "scattering" disorder and the most disruptive and violent
                    severing of social bonds are precisely the moments where the closest connections
                    between characters are made, and the densest concatenation of network links
                    exists.</div>

                    commonly accepted notion, expressed most recently by Emma Smith, that "tragedies tend to move towards the isolation of a
                            single figure on the stage, getting rid of other people, moving towards
                            a kind of solitude, whereas comedies tend to end with a big scene at the
                            end where everybody’s on stage"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#smith2009">Smith 2009</a>]. The network structure suggests precisely the opposite. It is true that
                    in this explosion of murder and political upheaval concluding the tragedy, all
                    of the characters could not be more distant from one another in terms of kinship
                    and affective bonds. The network visualization of this culminating scene,
                    however, suggests that the play enacts a "scattering" and
                    destruction of Elsinore’s social fabric by crowding the characters into a more
                    densely packed and interrelated social network. To put this point in narrative
                    terms, at the level of discourse, the play links and intermeshes speakers and
                    bodies in a dense knot so as to represent the intersubjective disorder between
                    previously "close" or related characters at the level of
                    plot. The network visualization of 5.2 pushes the characters at the moment of
                    violence and the greatest political and filial disorder into uncomfortably close
                    relationships - the dense proximity of characters in relation to one another
                    signifies that they speak to each other with a high level of frequency. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p28">28</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p28"> This counterintuitive network structure adds an important level of historical
                    nuance to contemporary network theory, which defines social networks most
                    frequently as affinity or affiliation groups bound by positive relationships
                    between people. The assumption of positive bonds defining network links is most
                    readily apparent in the persistent example of "friends"
                    composing social networks. As Mark Granovetter suggests, relationships with
                        "close friends" and "acquaintances" make up a social network [<a class="ref" href="#granovetter1983">Granovetter 1983</a>, 203] and Easley and Kleinberg define the
                    social network itself as "the collection of social ties among friends"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#easley2010">Easley and Kleinberg 2010</a>, 1]. By contrast, Shakespeare’s tragedies exhibit precisely the opposite
                    structure: they are not composed of affinity networks bringing together friends
                    or family, but rather these networks represent an array of negative
                    relationships, where social bonds are being broken. In Shakespeare’s historical
                    networks then, each edge in the network that initially signaled kinship or
                    affiliation can, within the scenes of greatest social discord, signify the
                    destruction of a social relationship between the two characters. Thus analyzing
                    the social structure of Shakespeare’s plays adds a useful level of historical
                    subtlety to our understanding of network behavior, which is often grounded in
                    the study of social media networks in the present.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p29">29</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p29"> A more precise way to define network relationships lies in the concept of
                        "clustering" from quantitative network theory. Mark Newman explains
                    network clustering as a type of transitive relationship in space: "If vertex A is connected to vertex B, and vertex B to vertex
                        C, then there is a heightened probability that vertex A will also be
                        connected to vertex C. In the language of social networks, the friend of
                        your friend is likely also to be your friend"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#newman2003">Newman 2003</a>, 183]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#newman2010">Newman 2010</a>]. The network visualization of 5.2 exhibits such
                    clustering behavior, with the scene populated by triangles of transitive
                    relationships between all of the characters. The clustering displayed by 5.2
                    differs markedly from the "hub and spoke" model of 1.2, where Hamlet and
                    Claudius serve as the social hubs around which the spokes of the network gather
                        (<a href="#figure01">Figure 1</a>). The culminating violence of 5.2
                    displays a far more dense network clustering pattern, with the characters in the
                    network interacting far more frequently with others, and not simply relaying
                    their communication through the central figures of Hamlet or Claudius. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p30">30</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p30"> A second way to think about the density of the network in this instance is the
                    distance between nodes. The close positioning of Hamlet, Claudius, Gertrude,
                    Laertes, Osric, and Horatio at the center of the network signals a greater
                    frequency of interaction between the characters than we have seen in previous
                    scenes. In the dense clustering of the network, characters speak to more people,
                    more frequently: the density of lines between characters traces the increase in
                    interaction, and the decreased distance between nodes signifies a greater
                    intensity of communication, with more frequent speech exchanged. To describe the
                    density of the network in quantitative terms, 5.2 has 34 total network
                    connections between characters, or 23.6% of total network links in the play as a
                    whole, as opposed to the symmetrically organized scene of Act 1, Scene 2 above,
                    which displays 9 network connections or 13% of the play’s total network links.
                    Additionally, 5.2’s 34 connections creates a network that is approximately 450%
                    more dense than the play’s average of 7.57 connections per scene (<a href="#figure04">Figure 4</a>). </div>

                    characterized by greater distance between characters and fewer total network
                    connections between them. In the scene representing the destruction of the
                    social order of Elsinore, the play constructs a social network to bind the
                    characters being destroyed together at the moment of the greatest
                        "scattering" and chaos. The positive act of theatrically connecting

                    performance strategy of binding in a social network so as to break apart the
                    social. The plays also describe in their own language the structure of dense
                    binding and knitting that occurs in the final scenes of chaos. Cleopatra defines
                    her own suicide as being wound in a "knot
                        intrinsicate" in 5.2.295 visualized above (<a href="#figure12">Figure 12</a>). <cite class="title italic">Othello</cite> most persistently
                    uses the language of nets and webs to describe the intersubjective mesh that
                    binds the characters. Othello, for example, defines himself during the violence
                    of 5.2 as "being wrought, / perplexed in the extreme"
                    (5.2.355). Being "perplexed" gestures to his
                    confusion upon being "enmeshed" in Iago’s "net." However, the etymology of "perplexed" adds a second level of meaning to Othello’s final
                    self-definition. The verb "to perplex" derives from the Latin <span class="foreign i">perplexitas</span>, which signifies a knotting, winding, or
                        binding.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6404e1398">[7]</a> Othello therefore voices in the word "perplexed" a basic
                    state of being confused, but based on the Latin root, also defines himself in an
                        "extreme" knotted or tangled state. Othello’s
                    state of perplexity reflects the play’s sustained obsession with how individuals
                    become bound in intersubjective nets. The network traces in spatial form the
                    play’s own vocabulary of nets and webs entangling individuals with others. In
                    Act 2, Scene 2, Iago voices the broad strokes of his plot as a web: "With as little a web as this will I ensnare as great a fly as
                        Cassio…I will gyve thee in thine own courtship." (2.2.169-171) The
                        "little web" expands beyond Cassio in Act 2,
                    Scene 3, to "enmesh" Cassio, Desdemona, and Othello
                    in a "net": <blockquote><p>
                        <div class="l"> His soul is so enfettered to her love</div>
                        <div class="l"> That she may make, unmake, and do what she list,</div>
                        <div class="l"> […]</div>

                        <div class="l"> That shall enmesh them all. (2.3.319-336)</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">Iago’s consistent use of the language of "webs" and "nets" as the
                    method to "ensnare,"
                    "gyve," and "enmesh"
                    others into his scheme does not suggest that Shakespeare was thinking in terms
                    of networks, in the contemporary sense of the word, when the play's characters
                    speak of "webs,"
                    "nets,"
                    "mesh,"
                    "snares," and being "perplexed." The play does, however, persistently mobilize the
                    language of webs and nets as a way to dramatize the discord between them. The
                    network captures how the playtext spins a "web" or "net" of conflict
                    between the characters in the language of the text and between the bodies of the
                    speakers on stage as a linguistic and physical way to structure intersubjective

                    the network of bodies defining the final scene. Claudius, Laertes, Gertrude,
                    Horatio, Osric, Fortinbras, the Ambassador from England, and the
                        "audience" all are clustered around Hamlet’s body as the
                    hub of this final tragic tableau as a network of mangled bodies. To a certain
                    extent, the film images demonstrate that the collision of bodies on stage as a
                    way to precipitate conflict and disorder is somewhat obvious - characters need
                    to be brought together to engage physically and to inflict violence upon one
                    another. However, readers of Shakespearean drama such as Nietzsche, Hegel,
                    Bradley, and other critics of tragedy in general in their wake have focused on
                    the thematic content of disorder, chaos, and the breaking of the social order,
                    without adequately acknowledging the organization of bodies in space - close
                    connections and physical proximity - as the basic condition needed to create a
                    theatrical frame for the tearing apart of human relations being expressed in the
                    plot.</div>

                    cannot be identical since every performance requires interpretive decisions left
                    open by the text to each director and actor. The point of the network analysis
                    is not to say that every performance will be the same, which is obviously
                    impossible. What is significant in the comparison in the network to the two
                    performances is that despite the artistic latitude opened by Shakespeare’s
                    plays, the underlying structural logic defining the relationship between the
                    characters as a chaotic arrangement of bodies in space in this catastrophic
                    scene is remarkably consistent.<a class="noteRef" href="#d6404e1687">[8]</a> The
                    spatial organization of the network describes a character-space that directors
                    and actors populate with movements, gestures, and speech. We could examine many
                    more scenes to compare the network to the performance as a mode of
                    methodological control. But beyond verification, the point of the present
                    analysis is to suggest that the network visualization method can teach us
                    something new about Shakespeare’s plays that revises a widely-held critical
                    consensus. The network analysis performed here opens up a space for reading
                    between text and performance, precisely as Weimann proposes, and should not be
                    understood as an authoritative account of tragedy. This represents the beginning
                    of a methodological conversation, rather than the final word on Shakespearean
                    tragedy in networks or in performance.</div>

                    But Shakespeare’s text demonstrates a persistent metatheatrical preoccupation
                    with precisely this translation of words into embodied performance, or how
                    language can be represented in space. Hamlet defines himself in his final
                    moments not in terms of an ontology - moving away from the question of "to be or not to be" - but rather in terms of his
                    literariness: "in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain /
                        To tell my story" (5.2.290-291). By impelling Horatio to "report" him "aright" and by
                    giving Fortinbras his "dying voice," (5.2.298) Hamlet
                    transforms his afterlife, that "undiscovered country"
                    into an act of correct narration, a "story." Hamlet’s
                    final transplantation of voice focuses on the act of linguistic articulation and
                        "report." However, Horatio’s final story is not vocative or oratorical
                    in nature. Rather, Horatio and Fortinbras perform a crucial modification in
                    transforming Hamlet’s story into a spatial arrangement of bodies on a
                        "stage": <blockquote><p><div class="l">Horatio: Give order that these

                        <div class="l">Horatio: Of that I shall have also cause to speak,</div>

                        <div class="l"> Of plot and errors happen. (5.2.321-339)</div></p></blockquote> Horatio’s account
                    moves away from the idiom of "story,"
                    "report," and "voice," dictated by Hamlet. He instead orders that
                        "these bodies / High on a stage be placed to the
                        view," translating Hamlet’s "story" and the act of
                        "reporting" from the articulation of the voice to a spatial arrangement
                    of bodies. The story is told not only in words, but also in the placement of
                        "bodies high on stage" as the materials of "carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts, / Of accidental judgments,
                        casual slaughters, / Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause."
                    These bodies function in the plane of vision - they are "placed to the view" - transmuting Hamlet’s story into an act of
                    spectatorship. Fortinbras compounds this definition of the metatheatrical space
                    by calling the "audience" and commanding that the
                    soldiers bear Hamlet "to the stage." Horatio insists
                    that the "story" will not take the form of an ode or
                    an oratory. He argues that the voice given to him by Hamlet is insufficient to
                    represent the events of the tragedy, since he will have to "draw on more" than speaking alone. The ultimate account of Hamlet’s
                    life takes on the form of a theatrical performance: it will be "presently performed." The performance in question
                    exerts a "wild" effect, reflecting the chaotic social
                    disorder and violence of the final scene. For Horatio, the "plot" will
                    paradoxically be most accurate, with the fewest "errors" and
                        "mischance," in this state of wildness. As in the preceding reading of
                    the network, the bodies densely clustered on stage for the performance of
                    Hamlet’s story reflects the state of wildness that concludes the play. The
                    network analysis corresponds with Horatio’s own metatheatrical appraisal of
                    performance. Both lead to the conclusion that the gathering and performance of
                    bodies in the space of the stage is the most accurate way to recount the
                        "wild" disordering of Elsinore’s social bonds.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">Reading the contours of the network as a way to translate the text into the
                    relationship of bodies in space is not an anachronistic imposition of digital
                    tools onto the Shakespearean text. The network visualization follows the rules
                    of Hamlet’s own metatheatrical commentary, and a commonplace understanding in
                    the Renaissance of the crosstalk between the body and the text. If anything,
                    this reading strategy converting language into spatial relationships takes
                    seriously the metatheatrical rules of performance that Hamlet himself
                    articulates in the play. In the "purpose of playing" speech in Act 3, Scene
                    2, Hamlet advises the players to "suit the action to the
                        word, the word to the action," insisting that proper performance
                    technique requires a movement beyond the enunciated word to a more dynamic
                    conversion of the written word into the "actions" of
                    the moving body. The translation of word to action occurs in space, indicated in
                    Hamlet’s statement of the "purpose of playing."
                    <blockquote><p>…the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the first and
                        now, was and is to hold as ‘twere the mirror up to nature, to show virtue
                        her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time
                        his form and pressure. (3.2.19-22)</p></blockquote> Transmuting the word into
                    dramatic action functions as a "mirror up to nature"
                    in space, "showing," representing "images," and revealing to the "very
                        age and body of the time" the physical contours of "his form and pressure." The mirror analogy, and the
                    gesture to Aristotle’s image of the wax seal as a "form and
                        pressure" defines "playing" as a play in space - a specular
                    optics or an experience of spectatorship - constituted by a visual array of
                    images, bodies, and forms [<a class="ref" href="#aristotle1936">Aristotle</a>, 412a6–412b6].
                    Putting Hamlet’s body on a "stage" at the end of the play is
                    therefore a fitting final confirmation of his preoccupation with "playing."
                    Beyond his specific fate, however, Hamlet’s injunction to "suit the action to the word, the word to the action" reflects a
                    broad Renaissance <span class="foreign i">topos</span> understanding the
                    body’s gestures as a crucial component of linguistic communication [<a class="ref" href="#hammond1992">Hammond 1992</a>, 82]. One example within Shakespeare’s corpus is
                    the response of the witnesses at the conclusion of the <cite class="title italic">Winter’s Tale</cite>: "There was speech in their
                        dumbnesse, Language in their very gesture" (5.2.11-12). The
                    convertibility of body and language was not simply theatrical, however, with
                    Thomas Wilson’s rhetorical manual calling for "the whole
                        bodie stirring together" as an embodied component of rhetorical
                    eloquence and delivery [<a class="ref" href="#wilson1909">Wilson 1909</a>, 220–221]. Hamlet’s model
                    of visualizing the word that "denotes" the spatial
                        "play" of actions and of bodies is precisely what
                    the network analysis attempts to accomplish by using the language of the text as
                    the basis of tracing the social links between different characters in space.
                    This is not to claim over-literally that Hamlet urges us to create networks. He
                    is, however, concerned with the translation of the linguistic "word" of the
                    playtext into the "play" of bodies in visual space, which is the basic
                    logic of the network analysis method. For Hamlet, theater is not meant to be
                    read as the word, but rather "shown" as a series of images.
                    The network graph is a good way of analyzing these spatial relationships in a
                    repeatable, robust way representing the ephemeral experience of theatrical
                    performance.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p48">48</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p48">The methodological problem lies in the fact that broad themes of conflict,
                    violence, and social disorder at the level of content and plot can be readily
                    perceived through reading, but visualizing the web of social relationships in
                    the reading process proves to be more difficult. Reading the Shakespearean text
                    necessarily requires a linear syntax, the unidirectional physical movement

                    Shakespeareans have taken up Jerome McGann’s famous dictum that the "reading eye is a scanning mechanism as well as a linear
                        decoder" by attempting to understand how the spatial structure of the
                    printed play influences the reading experience and performance [<a class="ref" href="#McGann1991">McGann 1991</a>, 113]. For example, Margaret Jane Kidnie’s focus
                    on how stage directions force a "two-axis" reading
                    beyond linear syntax, suggests that the printed page contains "impressions of activity" encoding actions to be
                    performed on stage [<a class="ref" href="#kidnie2004">Kidnie 2004</a>, 169]. The visualization
                    method we are proposing adds another dimension to a multi-axis reading practice
                    by translating the relationships (or "impressions of
                        activity") traced on the printed or inscribed page into the space of
                    a network. The network organizes the language of the play into coordinates in
                    graphical space that can more accurately delineate the complex relationships
                    between multiple characters across all of the scenes composing the play. The
                    network graphing method therefore functions as an intermediate step in the
                    conversion of the unidimensional syntax of the written playtext into the 3D
                    performance of bodies in the space of the stage. </div>

                    performance more accurately matches early modern understandings of the stage
                    itself as a place framing the actors’ bodies. The 1595 Swan sketch, which is the
                    only surviving drawing of the interior of an Elizabethan theater, shows a
                    performance in progress on the proscenium, with the actor’s bodies serving as

                    story of social interaction based on the proximity and distance, and the
                    intensity of physical connection in space in precisely the same way that the

                    organized around the actors’ bodies as the hub of the performance space, while
                    more recent diagrams attempting to imagine the Globe have studied the theater as
                    an architectural problem, or in terms of the class stratification of the
                    audience [<a class="ref" href="#cook1997">Cook 1997</a>]. The actors on stage in the Swan sketch are
                    in the midst of performance, and the image presents the interaction and movement
                    of characters. The left hand of the standing actor touches the shoulder of the
                    seated actor facing him, and his right hand gestures outward. The proximity and
                    physical connection between the characters on stage contrasts with the motion of
                    the third character, who stands at a distance from the other two and is captured
                    in a state of more dynamic movement across the stage closer to the groundlings,
                    while gesturing away from his plane of motion. Hugh Richmond has argued that the
                    dynamism of Shakespearean performance was a function of the performance space
                    itself. The presence of pillars on the Globe’s stage blocked the sight lines of
                    spectators, and thus its design required "an enormously
                        active, dynamic blocking plan" that was "almost
                        violently active and mobile, rather like a rugby league match" in
                    order to ensure that the audience could see what was happening [<a class="ref" href="#richmond2004">Richmond 2004</a>, 74]. The Swan sketch’s attention to the
                    positioning, gesture, and dynamic movement of characters on the stage (or
                    blocking, which Hammond believes to be irrecoverable) affirms Richmond’s take,
                    and represents a model of theatrical space that organizes the characters’ bodies
                    in performance in a state of motion, rather than defining that space as
                    disembodied architecture, or through the conjectural experience of the audience.
                    The network analysis corresponds closely to the understanding of the theatrical
                    space in terms of blocking and the positioning of characters and bodies, and
                    attempts to recuperate the early modern vision of performance as the conversion
                    of "action to the word, word to the action."</div>

                    geography in contemporary productions of Shakespeare. The director Gregory Doran
                    describes the Royal Shakespeare Company’s 2008 production of <cite class="title italic">Hamlet</cite> (visualized in <a href="#figure22">Figure
                        22</a>) as precisely a process of theatrical "translation" that begins with a bibliographical examination of the
                    Company’s First Folio edition, exploring the text "word-by-word, line-by-line" in order to structure the blocking and
                    positioning of the "stage geography." The meticulous
                    process of close reading reveals the characters’ "relationships with each other," and Doran insists that the playtext
                    itself contains a sort of blueprint for the organization of, and movement
                    within, space, apart from the director’s intervention: "the scenes begin to move themselves"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#doran2008">Doran 2008</a>, 1–5]. The network’s approach to understanding the play’s social world by
                    reasserting the importance of character-space as an organizing principle of the
                    playtext hews closely to the imagination of theatrical performance as the
                    clustering of bodies interacting within the spatial geography of the stage,
                    evinced by the Swan Sketch and as the mode of "translation" between

                    Hamlet’s final metatheatrical preoccupation with how "story,"
                    "voice," and linguistic "report" can be translated into "bodies high on a stage placed to the view" to be "presently performed" before an "audience" shows that the Shakespearean text contains within itself a
                    blueprint of sorts describing how to perform the movement from text to stage.

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52"> We are beginning to move our understanding of Shakespearean tragedy away from
                    the "conflict and waste" hypothesis mobilized by countless
                    critics since Bradley. Rather, the paradoxical theatrical move of linking
                    together as a means of disordering the social gestures to the logic of
                    enantiosis, or <span class="foreign i">discordia concors</span>, articulated
                    by the pre-Socratics and later appropriated as a model by both Hegel and
                    Nietzsche to define tragedy [<a class="ref" href="#McAlindon1991">McAlindon 1991</a>, 11 and 261–262].
                    If Bradley’s understanding of tragedy as a "division of
                        spirit involving conflict and waste" attempted to reject the Hegelian
                    and Nietzschean view of tragedy as a dialectic of order and disorder, the
                    network visualization shows that Shakespeare’s playtext itself structures the
                    space of tragic scenes in a more nuanced, if paradoxical, way [<a class="ref" href="#hegel1975">Hegel 1975</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#nietzsche1956">Nietzsche 1956</a>]. The performance of tragedy is not characterized
                    by a wasting away or violent incoherence, nor is it defined by a dialectical
                    movement of order and disorder. Rather, the network shows that scenes of tragic
                    violence perform a disordering of the social by organizing the characters as a
                    densely clustered network of bodies arranged in theatrical space. The scattering
                    of social bonds at the level of plot requires a movement away from order and
                    toward the alternative organizational indices of <em class="emph">density</em> and
                        <em class="emph">clustering</em> as ways to measure social bonds or connectedness at
                    the level of the theatrical discourse, or the language structuring the
                    relationships of characters and their bodies in the space of performance.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p53">53</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p53"> The network visualizations thus demonstrate spatially that the anti-social
                    explosions of violence tearing apart the social order of the play’s world
                    require the assembly of a dense social network on stage in order to be
                    represented to the audience. Shakespeare’s plays represent systems of increased
                    disorder in these paradigmatic scenes of tragedy by creating a different form of
                    order - the network - on stage. The clustering patterns of the network differ
                    substantially from the social order of the beginning of the plays, defined by
                    hierarchies characterized by a neat hub and spoke organization in space. The
                    counterintuitive play of a disordering made possible by the ordering of a
                    network corresponds to actor network theory’s appropriation of Michel Serres’
                    definition of social systems. As John Law describes, ANT has embraced Serres’
                    description of the social world as "patches of order in a
                        sea of disorder" as an organizing principle of networks [<a class="ref" href="#law2009">Law 2009</a>, 5].<a class="noteRef" href="#d6404e2106">[9]</a> For Law, the form of the network traces the
                        "boundaries between order and disorder" and is
                    capable of "imagining the uncertain messengers that pass between
                            different orders or between order and disorder"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#law2009">Law 2009</a>, 5]. For theorists such as Law and Latour, then, the network structure can
                    represent social systems forged in the interaction of order and disorder in a
                    way that traditional models built upon the assumption of order as the absence of
                    disorder (such as hierarchies, rankings, organizational charts, or dendrograms)
                    cannot. The interface between order and disorder also functions as a central
                    concept in Niklas Luhmann’s influential alternative account of the network as a
                    boundary between an organized system and the arbitrary, complex, and chaotic
                    world surrounding it. For Luhmann as for network theorists, the network
                    represents a space of order and the "reduction of
                        complexity" in a "sea" of disorder and
                    maximum entropy [<a class="ref" href="#luhmann1995">Luhmann 1995</a>, 27]. Both influential network
                    models define the social system as a pocket of order and reduced chaos in a vast
                    universe defined by randomness and disorder. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p54">54</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p54"> The present analysis of the networks traced within Shakespeare’s plays reverses
                    these precedents set by actor network theory and by Luhmann. The Shakespearean
                    networks do not create order as something different or partitioned from a
                    surrounding state of disorder, and networks do not represent an oasis of order
                    in a bleak entropic desert of disorder. Rather, Shakespeare’s plays present a
                    dramatic social world that turns the logic of the empirical networks suggested
                    by Law, Latour, and Luhmann on its head. Shakespearean tragedy stirs the reader
                    and audience by representing a state of chaotic social disorder emerging from
                    the assembly of a densely organized network of bodies and characters on stage.
                    The characteristic disordering of the social world in the plot of Shakespearean
                    tragedy requires the construction of an ever-increasingly dense social network
                    of actors, agents, bodies, witnesses, combatants, interlocutors, or characters
                    crowding the theatrical space where the chaos unfolds. Tearing apart the
                    relationships structuring the play’s initial social world - ordered by laws,
                    decrees, rules, ranks, filial bonds, gender norms, national or geographical
                    allegiances, and hierarchies - requires a new form of social order that
                    represents the complete overthrow of that original hierarchy. The new social
                    order resulting from Shakespeare’s tragedies is a state of disorder most
                    appropriately represented in the form of the network that visualizes this
                    counterintuitive spatial organization that is not based upon sharp boundaries
                    between order and disorder. In this seemingly paradoxical inversion of social
                    cause and effect, a new order captured by the network rises from a state of
                    chaotic tragic disorder, which is defined in terms of the asymmetrical,
                    seemingly chaotic form of network complexity, density, and clustering. The
                    network coalesces according to a logic best described as diffuse, non-linear,
                    intercalcated, non-hierarchical, multidimensional, and perhaps rhizomatic <span class="error"><a class="ref" href="#deleuze2004">#deleuze2004</a></span>. Understanding the network in this manner thus
                    revises an old story in Shakespeare studies echoed by several generations of
                    critics that describes the overthrow of the social order as a unifying theme of
                    the Shakespearean corpus. According to our reading, what seems to be an
                    explosion of chaos and disorder in the plot in fact sets the stage for tracing a
                    new social order of the non-hierarchical network on stage. Shakespeare’s plays
                    therefore do not destroy the social regime through a chaotic disordering, but
                    rather unbuilds the old social order based upon hierarchy, family, or law so as
                    to reimagine the social in terms of the rhizomatic branching of the network
                    through performance. The network, then, is not only a tool to explain the social
                    structure of Shakespeare’s plays. By the end of the tragedies, its concatenated,
                    non-linear form becomes the structure of a disordered social world itself,
                    leading us to a new imagination of social organization on stage based on density
                    and clustering.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p55">55</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p55"> What can we make of network theory after this analysis of Shakespeare’s plays?
                    This analysis of Shakespeare's tragedies reveals a more nuanced model of a
                    social network, which does not simply describe a mode of reduced complexity or
                    heightened organization (as Luhmann argues) or shape the relationships between
                    subjects and objects (as argued by Latour and Law). The network demonstrates a
                    counterintuitive mechanism where actors perform a disordering of the basic
                    coherence of the social by organizing bodies together into a network.
                    Shakespeare’s plays use these eruptions of social disorder as an occasion to
                    forge a new mode of non-hierarchical, non-linear sociality in the form of the
                    network. This analysis stands as an early modern revision of network theories
                    that have been created with contemporary data, and have not adequately studied
                    the historicity of networks across time. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p56">56</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p56"> Our case study on Shakespearean tragedy performs the methodological shift from
                    network theory to the description and analysis of actual networks that Bruno
                    Latour has proposed. Latour laments that although the scholarly community has
                    access to a "mass of data," this information is only "accessible through an incredibly poor visual
                            landscape"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#latour2011">Latour 2011</a>, 809]. He has recently asserted that the next horizon in analyzing the social
                    networks composing our world involves a methodological shift from network theory
                    to actual networks that "transform the mass of
                        quali-quantitative data" into a "visual datascape"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#latour2011">Latour 2011</a>, 809]. What is needed to enact this shift are more robust and accurate
                    visualizations of networks built upon a combination of qualitative and
                    quantitative data that can represent the intercalcated lattice of
                        "performances,"
                    "parts" and "actors" working in relation to one another, precisely in
                    the way that the dramatic performance visualizes the playtext as an embodied,
                    visual performance of actors interacting on stage. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p57">57</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p57"> We have argued that the network method suggested by Latour is a way to harness
                    the technical resources of the digital humanities to bridge the age-old divide
                    between text and stage in the study of Shakespeare. The networks decipher how
                    Shakespeare encodes within the text the spatial relationships of characters in
                    performance space, and his plays give us a rule book of sorts to accomplish
                    this, by meta-theatrically meditating upon how this translation of word to
                    bodies in space occurs. The digital method reveals a network structure that
                    allows us to revise a widely accepted story on social disorder and the overthrow
                    of law in Shakespeare’s plays, but this is by no means exhaustive, and it
                    represents the beginning of new readings made possible by network visualization.
                    The network method allows us to tell new stories about Shakespeare, and provides
                    us a different technical vantage point fusing textual close reading and the
                    study of performance in space. As a critical tool, the networks open up a
                    multi-tiered method that tests the digital visualizations against the results of
                    close readings and staged theatrical productions of the same scenes. Our case
                    study of the social networks of Shakespeare’s tragedies proposes a hybrid
                    methodology that investigators and students can use to engage in several
                    parallel techniques so as to gain multiple critical perspectives on a single
                    literary problem. Ultimately, we propose that the network methodology opens a
                    new perspective on Shakespeare’s dramatic art. Far from turning his body of work
                    into a cold, inert dataset that seems antithetical to humanistic inquiry, the
                    network method enlivens the text, allowing a wide range of readers - from
                    scholars publishing research to undergraduates encountering his plays for the
                    first time - to perceive the subtle manner by which the movements and energies
                    of embodied theatrical performance inhere within the Shakespearean text.</div>

                        and quantitative network theories define networks in much more general
                        terms. Quantitative network theory defines a social network as "a set of people or groups of people with some
                                pattern of contacts or interactions between them"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#scott2000">Scott 2000</a>]
                        [<a class="ref" href="#wasserman1994">Wasserman and Faust 1994</a>]. Easley and Kleinberg define "the idea of a network” as “a pattern of interconnections
                            among a set of things"
                        [<a class="ref" href="#easley2010">Easley and Kleinberg 2010</a>, 15]. In organization studies, Borgatti and
                        Halgin posit that "a network consists of a set of actors or nodes
                                along with a set of ties of a speciﬁed type (such as friendship)
                                that link them"

                        Law’s definition of the network in terms of "playing
                            parts" and the "enactment of
                            performance" echoes Jaques’ famous declaration in <cite class="title italic">As You Like It</cite> that "all the
                            world’s a stage / … and one man in his time plays many parts"
                        (2.7.138-141), as well as Antonio’s melancholic assertion in the <cite class="title italic">Merchant of Venice</cite> that the "world" is "a stage where every man must play
                            a part" (1.1.79) [<a class="ref" href="#law2009">Law 2009</a>, 151]. The
                        theatrical worldview adopted by network theory is already inscribed within
                        Shakespearean drama, which presents an insistent performative definition of
                        the social that defines the "world" as immanently theatrical, precisely
                        as network theory has begun to do four centuries later.</div><div class="endnote" id="d6404e869"><span class="noteRef">[5]</span> To test the resulting visualizations, we
                        used two other forms of methodological verification. Adapting Pierson’s
                        method to our own dataset, we "counted the number of
                            lines A spoke in scenes in which B was present, and vice versa, and
                            added these two numbers together." We then "computed the above number but, for each character in each scene,
                            multiplied by a 'normalization factor' equivalent to the number of
                            lines that character spoke in the scene divided by the total number of
                            lines in that scene." The three methods agreed at a much larger
                        scale than in Pierson’s analysis, which aggregated the results for whole
                        plays and only focusing on the romances, while we applied this
                        methodological verification to all of Shakespeare’s plays at the more local
