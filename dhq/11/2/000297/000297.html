                <p>In this paper we intend to present a tool we developed for translation studies
                    and diachronically compare various French translations of the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite>. </p>
                <p>This field of study is part of the more general "Classical Receptions"
                    studies that try to analyse the influence and adaptation of classical texts in
                    modern and contemporary literature, theatre, cinema, and many other artistic
                    fields. While Greek texts have been analysed by scholars for more than two
                    thousand years, research about classical translations is not yet a most renown
                    subject. In recent years this theme has raised a growing interest in the
                    academic community. </p>
                <p>We developed a program that can align textual sequences (defined as groups of
                    words delimited by a specified grammatical pivot, in our case proper nouns),
                    without need of previous training. We obtained alignments for many different
                    kinds of translations<a class="noteRef" href="#d2391e202">[1]</a>. While
                    other programs have an upper bound for one-to-many alignments (for example with
                    a maximum of four translated elements aligned to the same original element) this
                    algorithm allows an indefinite number of alignments, both for the source
                    sequences and the target ones. The aligner is based on an implementation of
                    Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and on a string-based similarity approach to textual
                    segments. The aligner needs to establish proper names as anchor words, as they
                    are a relatively stable feature through different translations and tend to be
                    similar in several languages. </p>
                <p>Thanks to the alignments obtained using the program, we can explore translations
                    in a number of ways. We will illustrate the creation of a graphical interface to
                    visualize French Homeric translations. </p>
                <p>With our tool, it is possible to highlight aligned portions of texts and show
                    their immediate differences or similarities, both in meaning and in syntactic
                    distribution. </p>
                <p>We will show some resulting syntactic analyses carried out on a small sample of
                    texts, taken from a corpus of twenty-seven unabridged French translations of the
                    Odyssey and explore how the study of diachronic translations through algorithms
                    of computational linguistics can produce interesting results for literary and
                    linguistic studies. </p>

                <h1 class="head">Background</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">The <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> can be considered as one of the major
                    pillars of modern literature. It has been translated in all major Indo-European
                    languages for many centuries. We created a digital corpus of fifty French
                    translations from the 16th century to the 20th for a total of 207 translations
                    and reprints. In this paper we shall try to demonstrate how trends and literary
                    movements could be analysed using the immediate statistic results and
                    visualizations that we obtained with our tool. This paper will focus on a sample
                    of the whole corpus. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">This paper focuses on the XIth book. This book is a very well known episode of
                    the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite>, often called the <span class="foreign i">nekuia</span>, containing a dialog with the dead (slightly
                    different, for example, from the <span class="foreign i">katabasis</span>, an
                    actual descent into Hell). It is also a key episode for translators. In France,
                    from the 16th to the 20th century, the three most translated books were the Ist,
                    the VIth and the XIth. Throughout our research, we have identified three kinds
                    of translations: translations made for scholastic readers who specialize in
                    Ancient Literature, translations made for school use, for students who need to
                    learn about Greek Literature and translations that appear as a kind of stylistic
                    exercise, and often an echo or an announcement of future works. The XIth book is
                    also interesting because every translator who chose to translate it went on to
                    translate the whole of the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite>. It often seems
                    to be a trial book, a book to test and improve literary skills and style. As a
                    result, we could sketch the translator’s virtual portrait: every single
                    translator of the XIth book has, sooner or later, devoted himself to defending
                    the literary value of Ancient Literature, and more precisely, every one of them
                    has seen in the Ancient corpus a source for inspiration, a stylistic potential
                    to unravel. That is why this particular book was chosen.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Concerning the Greek pivot text, it is based on the Greek text established by
                    Allen and Monro [<a class="ref" href="#monro1902">Monro 1902</a>], as it is the most widely used
                    representation of the Greek text, both before and after the 19th century. Monro
                    and Allen are also most familiar with the whole vulgate around Homer, and
                    include many variants from Eustathius, often considered as the most precious
                    source for reconstructing Homeric epics in Greek (since the
                        <em class="emph">princeps</em> edition of his commentaries in 1542). </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">To analyse trends or literary tendencies, the use of alignment and
                    post-processing algorithms appeared as a novelty. Many works already have been
                    made on aligning translations to their original texts (see for example [<a class="ref" href="#dechelotte2007">Déchelotte 2007</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#brown2003">Brown 2003</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gale1991">Gale 1991</a>]) but they focused on synchronic, non-literary corpora.
                    In literary studies, on the other hand, the necessity of textual alignment
                    appeared for two reasons: scholars wanted to evaluate a translation by
                    considering its source and to create a possible alternative to that translation.
                    As a result, the translation itself as a work of art remained underestimated.
                    Aligning translations gives the art of translation its rightful place: an
                    authentic literary experience, considering the translation itself as an object
                    of art and study. We therefore decided to focus on dividing and aligning each
                    translation, in order to identify possible stylistic trends and possible echoes
                    of the literary world of the translator. </div>
            </div>
            <div class="div div0">
                <h1 class="head">Automatic Alignment Method</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Since segment alignment is widely considered a necessary step in order to proceed
                    toward any kind of word alignment attempt [<a class="ref" href="#allauzen2009">Allauzen 2009</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gao2008">Gao 2008</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#gao2011">Gao 2011</a>], using a good global aligner
                    is regarded as an important prerequisite for many studies about automatic
                    translation. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">To align our translations to the original text we wrote a Java implementation of
                    the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm<a class="noteRef" href="#d2391e288">[2]</a>. The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [<a class="ref" href="#needleman1970">Needleman 1970</a>] was originally designed to align the amino acid
                    sequences of two proteins. This algorithm is expensive in terms of computational
                    complexity and efficiency of the procedure but remains a tool of the highest
                    quality to perform global alignment. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">There have been several attempts to adapt the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for use
                    in the field of text processing and digital humanities. To cite some of the most
                    recent cases, it has been used to perform phonetic alignments in historical
                    linguistics (see [<a class="ref" href="#list2013">List 2013</a>] for an overview), to perform
                    character-based detection of text similarities [<a class="ref" href="#gomaa2013">Gomaa 2013</a>], to
                    validate claims of structural affinity in narrative [<a class="ref" href="#reiter2014">Reiter 2014</a>]
                    and to detect similar URLs [<a class="ref" href="#germann2016">Germann 2016</a>]. It is sometimes used in
                    tasks of monolingual text alignment in combination with other systems [<a class="ref" href="#nelken2006">Nelken 2006</a>]. Since the algorithm in itself is designed to
                    globally align sequences of any kind, its implementations are different in every
                    case. What changes is usually the tokenization of the sequences, (these can be
                    divided in letters, words, or textual blocks as we see here), and the similarity
                    score used to decide whether two elements should be aligned or not. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">In our case, we re-purposed the Needleman-Wunsch structure to align bilingual
                    portions of text. Through the process described in the following pages we
                    globally aligned the XIth book of the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> with
                    several translations. Such an alignment allows several types of statistical

                    noun; a target sequence is a list of words beginning with a French (or any
                    target language) proper noun, stopping at index-1. However, proper nouns are not
                    completely reliable: duplications, interpolations, substitutions or unusual
                    translations happen in the onomastic field too. As a result rare proper nouns
                    tend to be more reliable pivots while frequent proper nouns should not be given

                    create a 2D matrix where all the sequences are stored: the source sequences are
                    stored in the columns (each sequence is stored in each column), the target
                    sequences are stored in the lines (each sequence is stored in a different line).
                    To align the elements of the series, it will be necessary to choose a scoring
                    system. A basic scoring system can be thus summed up: if a source element at
                    index <em class="emph">i</em> and a target element at index <em class="emph">j</em> are equal (two
                    identical letters, two similar numbers, etc.) the score stored in the matrix at
                    index <em class="emph">ij</em> is 1, otherwise 0. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p26">26</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p26">Our way of establishing scores between sequences is similar, but more selective.
                    We use many similarity metrics already well known that we implemented for our
                    own purposes, such as the Monge Elkan distance, the Levensthein distance, the
                    Jaro-Winkler distance, or the Hamming distance<a class="noteRef" href="#d2391e498">[4]</a> on both the
                    transformed Greek and the tags associated with each word (both in French and
                    Greek). The sequences carry their morphological information: each verb in Greek
                    is associated with a VB tag, each noun with a NN tag, etc. and so is the target
                    sequence. It therefore possible to take into account the syntactic similarity
                    between the source and the target. Yet again, this is far from being the only
                    similarity measures we use. The similarity is also determined by the frequency
                    of the proper nouns used both in source and in target sequences. Since the
                    frequency of proper nouns, like that of words in general, follows a Zipfian
                    distribution, we give to proper nouns a similarity score which is inversely
                    proportional to their frequency. If a low-frequency noun appears in Greek, and
                    if its potential translation can be found in its potential matching sequence,
                    the similarity is much stronger. We also take into account the absolute distance
                    between two sequences. If a very short sequence is associated with a very long
                    one, the score between the two is very likely to be low. Finally, another
                    essential similarity measure can only be performed once a first alignment has
                    been produced. In a second alignment, as we will see, we can take into account
                    the distributional semantic similarity between words. </div>

                    occurs in each aligned original-translation block. In this way, the contextual
                    information which is usually taken into account in semantic spaces is removed
                    and the co-occurrence of bilingual couples in the aligned blocks emerges with
                    clarity. A French word and a Greek word occurring in the same sequence of
                    aligned blocks will have similar vectors. Through this method we manage to
                    automatically retrieve a small dictionary of word-translation pairs. Naturally,
                    the length of this dictionary is modifiable changing the similarity threshold
                    above which two elements are considered a word-translation pair. If the first
                    alignment was very noisy (for example with many gap and large blocks) we will
                    need a higher threshold to establish a meaningful correspondence, while a
                    cleaner first alignment will allow us to relax our acceptability constraints. It
                    also becomes evident if a text tends to use always the same translation for the

                    designed to be a purely local tool. However, when the time came to show our
                    results to a wide variety of researchers, we soon found out we needed a web
                    interface, to address the needs of specialists in Digital Humanities and a wider
                    range of literary researchers.<a class="noteRef" href="#d2391e574">[7]</a> The whole code is open-source, on
                    our GitHub repository, and the .jar may be compiled with the .jardesc file. The
                    web interface, although on a different repository, is built for this program.
                    The users input files, as can be seen in the open-source code, can be in several
                    formats, such as .doc, .txt or .xml. During the process, the program will
                    segment integral texts into its main components, such as chapters, parts or
                    books (essentially with the use of regular expressions when the scheme is basic
                    enough). For the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite>, it is segmented in books.
                    The book-segmented texts are printed in xml files. We then apply our
                        <em class="term">NamesPatternMatcher</em> to create xml files with elements segmented
                    by proper nouns. Each of these elements has its correspondent attribute
                    lemmatized and tagged. When the alignments have been done, the output is printed
                    in xml files with a fixed identification for each sequence, which allows us to
                    associate it with the source, but also with its corresponding targets. </div>

                    have a clear overview of all the translations at once. The web interface we
                    built for visualization allows us to visualize all the dynamically aligned text
                    simultaneously. One of the features that still remains to be added to the web
                    interface is a personal notebook for each user with the possibility of
                    commenting on chosen aligned sequences and hyper-linking those commentaries to

                    at once. The fact that one is able to analyse multiple translations at once
                    while focusing on extremely precise events in the texts also shows what the
                    whole process of translation studies hints at, that one does not simply read
                    Homer’s text, but only one singular aspect of it from a particular author. </div>

                    each translator illustrates his perceptions in his own style shows the reader
                    that the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> is not just one text, but a myriad
                    of interpretations brought to us through translations. To fully understand this
                    variation, close-reading is not sufficient and may easily be faulty. One may be
                    able to make accurate statements on some correspondences between one source text
                    and one target text, but it is highly doubtful that the human brain would be
                    able to compare so many translations at once and get a clear view of all the
                    relevant information. Not only is the human process slower and riskier, but it
                    also does not allow the adjunction of all the metadata our program can take into
                    account, such as the association of unexpected expressions or words found thanks
                    to distributional semantics that help us visualize the evolution of different
                    concepts through time. Finally, some scholars, such as Noémi Hepp [<a class="ref" href="#hepp1968">Hepp 1968</a>], tend to present their own subjective judgements about
                    various translators as objective ones, while analysing the texts through
                    close-reading. The result is that, although Noémi Hepp might be considered as
                    deliberately controversial in this matter, some of her assertions about
                    translators that either she or translation critics of the time disliked are
                    clearly (both statistically and syntactically) unjustified. </div>

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">The idea that a cultural regeneration is deeply related to linguistic
                        regeneration flourishes. That is to say that French poets tend to seek their
                        own style within Ancient Epics. The general idea is that the skillful
                        translator should not slavishly imitate the author’s genius, but enrich it
                        by giving it his own skill and language (<span class="foreign i">translatio
                            studii</span>). Translating appears therefore to be highly linked
                        with imitation. The same tradition is tangible in Ronsard’s followers’
                        works, such as in Amadis Jamyn’s <cite class="title italic">Iliad</cite> in
                        hexameters. The <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> had only been partially
                        translated before Salomon Certon, and his attempt is the first ever to
                        translate the entire <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite>. Although Certon
                        translates the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> at the beginning of the
                        17th century, he is clearly inspired by the methods and traditions of the
                        16th century. He specializes in Latin metrics that he tends to reproduce,
                        and it is clearly visible that he has read Jamyn’s first three and
                        Peletier’s first two books [<a class="ref" href="#salel1545">Salel 1545</a>], as he tends to
                        imitate them, or even cite them <span class="foreign i">pro verbo</span>.
                        Initially he did not want to translate the whole <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite>, and it was Henri IV himself that asked for the
                        complete translation. But Certon did acknowledge his affiliation with his
                        predecessors, and did not count so much on innovation. Like Jamyn, he is not
                        such a good Hellenist, and is forced to repeatedly use Volterra’s Latin
                        translation, which was not even the latest and most accurate of his time. As
                        a result, many times, when Certon misses parts of the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite>, it can be attributed to a Latin omission (while these
                        parts are present in his Greek version). However, his translation, as we
                        will see, seems to be nearer to the Greek than, for example, Jamyn’s. Certon
                        tends to reproduce more proper nouns than Jamyn, and is much nearer to the
                        Greek syntax and phonemes than his predecessor. As a result we could say
                        that his translation is not innovative in his translating habits, but that
                        being the first of its kind in terms of tackling the whole <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> in French, he had to rely more heavily
                        than his predecessors on both Latin and Greek versions. </div>

                        causes an expansion of the text, leading to the presence of many hapaxes or
                        low frequency terms, that is to say words that are not present in any of the
                        other translations at this point of the text. For example, in "<span class="foreign i">Lorsque j’eus par mes voeux &amp;
                                supplications / Apaisé les esprits, fait mes

                        be justified by the Greek text. This suggests that Certon privileged
                        maintaining the metre over strict accuracy. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Comparing Certon’s translation with the others it is apparent that he
                        translates in "alexandrins", and tends to drastically develop the Greek
                        text (his is one of the longest texts in our corpus). The verb "<span class="foreign i">λαβὼν</span>" simply
                        disappears. The word "<span class="foreign i">κελαινεφές</span>",
                        literally "in black smoke", becomes "<span class="foreign i">une rivière grosse et du coup une humeur noirastre
                                distilloit</span>" ("an enormous river
                            and from the neck a black liquid ran"), which is a clarification
                        and an amplification. Many of Certon’s connotations cannot be deduced from
                        the Greek text, such as souls "<span class="foreign i">qui
                            volent</span>" ("flying"), "<span class="foreign i">vaines</span>" ("empty") (Christian heritage of the
                        soul’s lightness). Death is personified, which is quite far from the
                        traditional pagan belief of the souls’ peregrination. The tragic connotation
                        is amplified. The "<span class="foreign i">Ἐρέβευς</span>", like
                        in Volterra’s Latin translation [<a class="ref" href="#maffei1523">Maffei 1523</a>], is absent. In
                        fact, in his whole translation, Certon tends to emphasize the gleam and
                        shine of French. Therefore, we may say that, if there is a kind of imitation
                        of the Greek text, it is more the imitation of a spirit rather than servile
                        literal imitation. Certon’s goal, when translating the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> is less a stylistic matter than a moral matter. For
                        Certon, the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> seems to have a moral
                        function much more than a purely aesthetic one. </div>

                        program when you compare La Valterie’s translation [<a class="ref" href="#lavalterie1709">de la Valterie 1709</a>] to Boitel’s [<a class="ref" href="#boitel1638">Boitel 1638</a>], as
                        they have very rare terms in common in the same places and follow the same
                        syntactic structure, almost amounting to plagiarism). </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p46">46</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p46">Our program does help us to see immediately that La Valterie’s translation is
                        extremely far from the original text, and even contradictory with its
                        supposed source. A frequency study shows that the whole (or at least the
                        majority) of La Valterie’s translation is sewed with hapaxes (it is both far
                        from the Greek text and never used in any of the French translations), which
                        made it the most difficult text to align. We can also see that, although
                        most translators tend to reproduce important syntactic marks in Greek (full
                        stops, etc), La Valterie’s translation is the only one with no resemblance
                        whatsoever to the Greek syntax. This is visible in our example. Sentences
                        are long, there are frequent clarifications, tangible modalisations, and, of
                        course, many mistakes. It is also clear in this example that La Valterie
                        tends to avoid what he considers as trivial words and expressions, which
                        need to be either modernized or deleted. The word "<span class="foreign i">cérémonies</span>" may be justified (though it erases the
                        polysemic "<span class="foreign i">εὐχωλῇσι</span>" and
                                "<span class="foreign i">λιτῇσί</span>", both
                        supplications and liturgical prayers), "<span class="foreign i">se rebutter des incommodités de leur
                                vieillesse</span>" ("grieving about
                            the harshness of old age") is a complex manner of defining a much
                        simpler down to earth single word in Greek, "<span class="foreign i">πολύτλητος</span>" (then again this whole expression is an
                        hapax, as no other translator will bother to be so disdainful of a simple
                        practical term). The word "<span class="foreign i">Capitaines</span>"
                        is a condensation of war heroes adapted to the 17th century. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">Therefore, La Valterie’s translation is both very far from being accurate or
                        even faithful to the Greek. In later critical essays on Homeric
                        translations, especially in Madame Dacier’s work, which is discussed below,
                        La Valterie is seen as someone who has been left behind by the progress of
                        translation. His translation has been edited, reprinted, but there are still
                        no serious critics who say anything positive about it, quite the opposite in
                        fact. A few years late, La Valterie becomes the paragon of a moralist
                        translator; fit to feebly teach some moral values, but clearly unfit to
                        reveal Homer’s beauty. From the 17th century onward, practising translation
                        as a mere imitation is no longer an unquestionable principle. </div>

                                dont Homere parle, puisque les Morts ne l’avaient plus ; il parle du

                                Ce qui me parait le plus surprenant ici, c’est ce qu’Ulysse ajoute,

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p50">50</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p50">The first turning point in contrast with this tendency seems to appear with
                        Madame Dacier’s translations (from what we gathered from the program,
                        studying the texts diachronically). Anne Lefebvre Dacier (known as "Madame
                            Dacier"), wrote her translations as a reaction to Homeric imitations.
                        Many translators had followed the same principles as La Vallterie for at
                        least a century. The <cite class="title italic">Iliade</cite> by La Motte [<a class="ref" href="#lamotte1714">Houdart de La Motte 1714</a>] is one of the many examples of a tendency to
                        transform the epics into an "up-to-date" version. In this general
                        atmosphere, Madame Dacier is an exception. She was very fond of Greek and
                        Latin from a very young age, and was given the chance to grow up with just
                        as much education as a man thanks to her father. Though small and, above
                        all, a woman, her strong character and her excellent knowledge of Greek
                        forced her peers to acknowledge the quality of her many
                            publications<a class="noteRef" href="#d2391e911">[11]</a>. She is a paragon of scientific, archaeological and
                        philanthropic knowledge of Homer’s works. As she says herself in her <cite class="title italic">Iliade</cite>: <blockquote><p><span class="foreign i">Je n’écris pas pour les savants qui lisent Homère en sa langue
                                (...) j’écris pour ceux qui ne le connaissent point, c’est à dire
                                pour le plus grand nombre, à l’égard desquels ce poète est comme

                        [<a class="ref" href="#dacier1717">Dacier 1717</a>] is heavily annotated (the notes generally take
                        three quarters of a single page). She wants her readers to see Homer as he
                        is, not as he should be in a contemporary world. Therefore, she has to
                        explain many of the incoherences and cultural gaps that would make Homer
                        incompatible with the modern world. She tends to justify shocking
                        descriptions or attitudes in the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite> by
                        saying that those were acceptable because they were different, and justifies
                        her assertions both philologically and archaeologically. She also tends to
                        erase most of Homer’s stylistic specificities, as they have no scientific
                        purpose. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p52">52</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p52">Dacier uses common terms for the society she lives in, uses simplified
                        syntax, and above all annotates her text enormously. We included the notes
                        and explanations directly in the text but did not align them. What is most
                        visible in this abstract is that Dacier tends to respect the length and
                        syntax of the Greek text, much more than her predecessors. It is also
                        visible that she initiates this tendency for the following translators such
                        as Bitaubé (for more details on syntactic proximity after Madame Dacier, see
                        our website). She erases the polysemy of the Greek word "<span class="foreign i">κελαινεφές</span>", interpreting it in a
                        logical and clarified way (leaving aside both the smoky effect and its
                        blackness). She just translates the expression "<span class="foreign i">νεκύων κατατεθνηώτων</span>" by "<span class="foreign i">les ombres</span>", erasing the redundancy like "the dead
                            that have lived". Dacier definitely wants to imitate the Greek
                        syntax, keeping the paratactic "<span class="foreign i">τε</span>":
                        this is quite visible in the important similarity to the Greek throughout
                        the text (see greyer colums). She also chooses to clarify the polysemous
                        word "<span class="foreign i">νεοπενθέα</span>", with the images of
                        both sorrow and flowers. She adapts the deity Ares into Mars who would be
                        more familiar to her audience, and she is one of the rare translators (along with
                        Bitaubé) to use this adaptation. We decided to add the footnote we included,
                        as it shows Dacier’s desire to explain the war heroes’ death in terms of
                        Christian beliefs. There is no phonetic proximity to the Greek whatsoever.
                        She does not simply want to imitate Homer but to make him understandable for
                        her readers and so phonetic imitation, which is seen later in Leconte de
                        Lisle, would be counter-productive. It is also noticeable that this abstract
                        contains a large amount of green words, while earlier translations do
                        not.This means that many of the words she uses were then imitated and
                        reproduced by her followers. From the imitative flowery pomp we got from the
                        previous century, we now get a form of puritanism from this erudite
                        translator. </div>

                        concerning style, imitating, as much as possible, Homer’s <span class="foreign i">brevitas</span>. As a
                        result, in only one century, the reader goes from imitative flowery pomp to
                        scholarly puritanism. In our text, Bitaubé tries to maintain both the Greek
                        syntax (just as Dacier did), but also its polysemous terms. For example,
                        where Dacier used two coordinates, for "<span class="foreign i">λαβὼν</span>" and "<span class="foreign i">ἐλλισάμην</span>", Bitaubé chooses juxtaposition,
                        maintaining the Greek hypotyposis. The blackness and the liquid aspect of
                        the "<span class="foreign i">κελαινεφές</span>" is now explicit
                                ("<span class="foreign i">les noirs torrents</span>").
                        Bitaubé also attempts, as much as possible, to reproduce the Greek
                        redundancy "<span class="foreign i">νεκύων κατατεθνηώτων</span>".
                        Finally, he strictly imitates the Greek syntax, maintaining the paratactic

                        value, lost in modern times, both aesthetically and politically. Bitaubé is

                        published. For the first time, the aim is to publish a large amount of
                        abridged translations, and if a certain abstract has more success than
                        others, publish the entire translation. These translations are
                        typographically recognizable; the first page is a word-to-word translation,
                        unreadable and not supposed to be fluent, and the second page is a
                        linguistically acceptable translation. This practical use of translation
                        reveals two essential points in the evolution of translation practices.
                        Firstly, in order for a translation to be judged adequate, it must show that
                        the translator perfectly understood the syntactic problems of the Greek text
                        and secondly, that Greek and Latin studies have never been more important in
                        general education. </div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p66">66</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p66">However, Sommer’s many translations [<a class="ref" href="#sommer1854">Sommer 1854</a>] do not aim at
                        being original or stylistically distinguishable, but mainly tend to explain
                        Greek syntactic problems. In our text, Sommer never omits a single word,
                        keeping each redundancy, without seeking poetic effects (e.g.: the "<span class="foreign i">ψυχαὶ νεκύων
                                κατατεθνηώτων</span>" is simply translated by "<span class="foreign i">les âmes des
                            morts</span>"). What is more, Sommer tends to maintain Greek
                        temporality: he keeps aorists and imperfects, not considering French habits
                            ("<span class="foreign i">la pâle crainte s’emparait
                                de moi</span>", "the pale dread was
                            getting to me"). Sommer’s translation is clearly and without any
                        doubt the nearest text to the Greek syntax. The syntactic similarities are
                        at their highest points throughout the text. What is more, the text displays
                        an enormous amount of green and blue words, that is to say extremely
                        frequent words. He does not aim at originality, but at reproducing the
                        meaning word by word. Finally he is one of the rare 19th century translators
                        (along with Leconte de Lisle) who share such a close proximity to the Greek
                        at this precise point. </div>

                        languages. Almost paradoxically, the extreme accuracy asked for from the

                        culture, but enrich their own style with the contact of strangeness. The
                        climax of this tendency seems to be reached with Leconte de Lisle [<a class="ref" href="#leconte1867">Leconte de Lisle 1867</a>]. Not only does he use rare terms or even
                        hapaxes, but he also creates neologisms, and imitates the Greek itself as a
                        sound. Leconte de Lisle was one of the reasons we used the Greek text as
                        pivot as he is often quite literal in his phonetic imitations (he is without
                        doubt the author that has the more italics in his text); this means it tends
                        to be very different from traditional syntax. Indeed, the goal might have
                        been first to disassociate the reader from his own <span class="foreign i">hic et nunc</span>, for lost and far away realities, but also to
                        create a form of poetic hermetism. As a result, the program points out that
                        in Leconte de Lisle’s translation there are many hapaxes and many word
                        similarities with the Greek, which is to say archaisms<a class="noteRef" href="#d2391e1250">[16]</a>. The goal is clearly to recreate a complete work of art,
                        poetic and independent from its source for a renewed modern language. In our
                        text, what is most noticeable is that Leconte de Lisle maintains most of the
                        Greek syntax and uses an enormous amount of hapaxes (the first in our whole
                        corpus to use so many hapaxes). In the first sentence, he strictly imitates
                        Greek temporality, and he is the first to explicitly keep the perfect
                        participle <span class="foreign i">κατατεθνηώτων</span> (accomplished
                        fact) with "<span class="foreign i">les morts qui ne sont
                                plus</span>" ("the dead that are no
                            more"). The <span class="foreign i">Ἐρέβευς</span> is also
                        phonetically imitated, as shown with the italics, translated as "<span class="foreign i">Erebos</span>". The following sentence exactly
                        maintains the Greek syntax (nominative juxtapositions, demonstrative pronoun
                                "<span class="foreign i">οἳ</span>"). But what is more,
                        Leconte de Lisle maintains, as much as possible, every assonance and
                        alliteration present in the Greek text ("<span class="foreign i">θεσπεσίῃ ἰαχῇ</span>", with three and
                        two syllables: "<span class="foreign i">frémissement
                                immense</span>", with three and two syllables). Even the
                        books themselves are not books anymore but "rhapsodies". This tendency
                        illustrated by Leconte de Lisle is clearly seen at the time as an
                        emancipation. Translating means working not only on a source language, but
                        on French itself. The fact that a new kind of French is needed is visible in
                        the way translators deliberately skew common meanings and usage. Translation
                        is not perceived only as a symbolic means of understanding ideas and
                        culture, but also as a new way to express impression and sound. Translation
                        itself is a new work of art. </div>

                        increasing specialization of scientific and documentary matter. Knowing
                        Greek means more and more that one should be familiar with a precise
                        contextualized Greek reality and history. The study of Greek becomes the
                        study of Greek history and archaeological value, not so much as purely
                        developing a stylistic and grammatical ability. </div>

                        as a literary masterpiece and a considerable source of archaeological
                        information; he saw the epics as both a poem and a document. As a result,
                        Bérard’s translation [<a class="ref" href="#berard1924">Bérard 1924</a>] was paradoxically easy and
                        challenging to align. It was easy because Bérard tends, writing in
                        hexameters, to reproduce the syntactic movement of the Greek verse. He also
                        tends to keep the polysemous aspects of each particular word as well as
                        keeping in mind the principle of <span class="foreign i">brevitas</span>.
                        As a result, if we compare the syntax of each aligned chunk with its Greek
                        correspondent, we find an extraordinary proximity of length and syntax,
                        almost as high as Sommer’s. However, it was also, in some parts, difficult
                        to align. This is because because, being an archaeologist, Bérard tends to
                        force the original text into his own present reality. For example, he tends
                        to change toponyms so that they match real places in modern Greece. This
                        characteristic found in many of Bérard’s translations and works on Antiquity
                        has been qualified as the "<span class="foreign i">complexe de Victor
                                    Bérard</span>"
                             [<a class="ref" href="#montalbetti1997">Montalbetti 1997</a>]. Bérard wanted to locate every single <span class="foreign i">topos</span> described in the <cite class="title italic">Odyssey</cite>
                        in the modern world. To do so, from 1902 to 1912, he travelled throughout
                        the Mediterranean sea, and wrote four volumes of 400 pages each entitled
                            <cite class="title italic">Les Navigations d’Ulysse</cite>

                        Later in the <cite class="title italic">Sillage d’Ulysse</cite>
                        [<a class="ref" href="#berard1933">Bérard 1933</a>], Bérard collects all the photographs Fred
                        Boissonnas, who accompanied him on his trips, took in Greece and identified
                        each one as a specific Homeric <span class="foreign i">topos</span>. This
                        is symbolic of what Bérard thinks about the art of translation, that it is
                        as much archaeological research as it is a poetic activity. He views it as a
                        way of combining past and present into a single universal reality. In our
                        text, Bérard mainly imitates the natural movement of the Greek line, using
                        the hexameter. For the first time, every Greek word is translated, this time
                        in the iconic <span class="foreign i">brevitas</span> style, which makes
                        this translation a true masterpiece, being both poetic and precise. For
                        example, "<span class="foreign i">κελαινεφές</span>" is translated by "<span class="foreign i">les sombres vapeurs</span>" which
                        is the shortest and yet the most literal translation we have. The same thing
                        can be noticed about the word "<span class="foreign i">θύμος</span>", erased from so many translations before,
                        literally maintained without awkwardness, by "<span class="foreign i">portant au coeur</span>" ("bearing in their heart"). Let us also notice that
                        the dread does not have a clarity, but a color, a characteristic that he
                        will be the first one to use, and the nearest to the Greek so far. What is
                        more, Bérard is the first since Certon to fully express Odysseus’ fear with
                        the hypotyposis present throughout the description of the dead, and keeping
                        the paratactic asyndeton. We can notice a true evolution with Bérard’s
                        translation, initiated, we may suppose, by Leconte de Lisle. The strangeness
                        of Greek must be assumed both as a philologic information for the Hellenist
                        and an aesthetic novelty for the poet. We can therefore also see 
                        Bérard, apart from Leconte de Lisle, as one of the first to assume fully
                        Greek proper nouns, many of which are in italics. We can also see that his
                        translation, still one of the most well known in France today, has been
                        reused and changed (in very different ways), both by Philippe Jaccottet and
                        Frédéric Mugler. Indeed, Frédéric Mugler is often seen to reuse Bérard’s
                        translations without citing him, which we can see in our program as he uses
                        expressions that have a very low frequency and that are only present in
                        Bérard’s translation. For example, just like in Bérard, the invocation is
                        made to the "<span class="foreign i">peuple des
                                défunts</span>", the animal’s throat is "<span class="foreign i">tranchée</span>" (just as
                        in, and only in, Bérard and Jaccottet), the old men are "<span class="foreign i">chargés d’épreuves</span>", and
                        finally the dread is described with exactly the same words, "<span class="foreign i">je verdissais de
                            crainte</span>". Concerning Jaccottet, it seems to be a quite
                        different matter, as he is the first, after Bérard, to use French verses to
                        translate the Greek epics. </div>

                        entirely). We should just stress that with the program we could spot two
                        schemes: firstly Jaccottet’s lines, just like Bérard’s, tend to reproduce
                        Greek syntax, secondly, Jaccottet uses high frequency and everyday words,
                        which sets him apart from Bérard. This tends to illustrate what Jaccottet
                        may say himself about his own style: expression should be "<span class="foreign i">loyale</span>" (both "accurate" and
                            "faithful"). From a translator’s point of view, this first means
                        that there is a promise of truth between the word and the object it
                        represents, but also between a foreign word and a familiar word. As
                        Jaccottet states himself: <blockquote><p><span class="foreign i">Y

                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p75">75</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p75">Both Bérard and Jaccottet, though to different extents, embody this
                        increasing attention to the poetics of their source material and the need to
                        reproduce an echo of what has been lost. In our text, we can first notice a
                        symmetric inversion of the syntactic order, emphasizing the liturgical
                        aspect of the scene and the Homeric tendency to maintain the hesitation
                        between the narrative and the incantation. The expression "<span class="foreign i">les deux bêtes</span>"
                            ("the two beasts"), most unusual, may be due
                        less to the context than to the phonic imitation of <span class="foreign i">δὲ</span>. The word "<span class="foreign i">trou</span>" is
                        almost shocking, but then again reflects the phonic imitation of <span class="foreign i">βόθρον</span>, and its extreme simplicity (an
                        essential notion in Jaccottet’s poetry). The problematic expression "<span class="foreign i">ψυχαὶ νεκύων
                                κατατεθνηώτων</span>" is translated with apparent ease,
                        both keeping the pleonasm and the naturalness of the language, with "<span class="foreign i">les âmes des défunts
                                trépassés</span>" ("the souls of the
                            departed dead"). The adjective "<span class="foreign i">étrange</span>" ("strange") maintains Odysseus’ uneasy
                        feeling (implied by "<span class="foreign i">θεσπεσίῃ</span>"),
                        and while Jaccottet maintains the final imperfect (also visible in the Greek
                        text), he gives it an inchoative connotation, which is most original.
                        Finally, let us point out that there are no capitals in Jaccottet’s poetry,
                        corresponding both to his own principle of "<span class="foreign i">effacement</span>" ("disappearance") and to a vision of
                        poetic rhythm (conceived as a blow, a wind, which should not be stopped). </div>

                        saw, he tends to reproduce as many phonemes as he can, and many of his
                        proper nouns, but also many inner words, are in italics, and he has an

                    Homeric text was barely known and barely accessible in common language,
                    translation was more a matter of <span class="foreign i">imitatio</span> than

                    language. Translations were then quite far from the original, both because Greek
                    language was very poorly known, and because there was a need for a national
                    poetry that could not be satisfied by merely copying <span class="foreign i">pro
                        verbo</span>. This perpetual adaptation and, some might say, mutilation
                    of the Greek text found its counterpart later on in a renewed interest in the
                    Greek text itself. This view led to the idea that the original text needed to be
                    re-evaluated and cleaned of all its modern modifications. Following this, there
                    was a movement to make the Greek language and Greek archaeological culture more
                    accessible to scholars and the wider public. Translations were then nearer to
                    their source and more respectful of its historical foundation. This new
                    scholarly interest in the Greek itself led to a wider grammatical and scientific
                    study of the language both in universities and schools. All translations of the
                    19th century are conditioned by this new linguistic approach, less and less
                    caring about its moral potential teachings. But the knowledge of the Greek,
                    precisely because of this grammatical and linguistic specialisation, was
                    progressively confined to a more restricted and scholarly area. The Homeric
                    epics became considered, especially after the First and Second World Wars of the
                    20th century, both as a poem and as a document. Therefore, up to Jaccottet’s and
                    Mugler’s translation, it did not lose its poetical value, but it was more
                    recently perceived as some forgotten sound, some echo of a culture that is
                    nowadays lost and that one cannot pretend to fully adapt to modern times. </div>

                    include comparing translations with the source text as well as comparing
                    different translations. The analysis presented in this paper is focused on a

                    translations. A longer work would be able to address questions of whether these
                    translations are representative of contemporary literary fashions and styles, as

                    possible using the same system. Aligning multilingual translations we could both

                    and approaches. We would like to compare, for example, the set of French
                    translations of the 11th book with a small group of Italian translations of the
                    same text, to identify unique and different trends in different languages. </div>

                        emphasizes a number of general software design principles. In particular,
                        two aspects characterize the process of such a design: 1) considering and
                        putting into effect general and proven solutions to recurring design
                        problems (see design patterns, [<a class="ref" href="#gamma1995">Gamma 1995</a>]), and 2) taking
                        into account suitable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) as the
                        actual means to separate services from the implementation details [<a class="ref" href="#tulach2008">Tulach 2008</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#henning2009">Henning 2009</a>]. As a result, the
                        component tries to achieve a high degree of extensibility with a low degree
                        of modification (see Open-Close principle in [<a class="ref" href="#robert2000">Robert 2000</a>]).
                        By doing so, the clients of the aligner module have to work only with the
                        Abstract Data Types (ADTs) which have no part in the implementation
                        mechanisms [<a class="ref" href="#gabbrielli2010">Gabbrielli 2010</a>]. Consequently users rely only on
                        well-defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) which are exported by
