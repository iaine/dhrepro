                <p>Three years after his death Friedrich Kittler’s impact on the Humanities and
                    Media Studies remains a topic of interest to scholars worldwide. The
                    intellectual challenges presented by his theoretical work, however, are now
                    complemented by the practical and archival difficulties of dealing with his
                    personal digital legacy. How are we to preserve, survey and index the complex
                    data collection Kittler bequeathed to the German Literature Archive in Marbach
                    in the shape of old computers and hard drives? How are the Digital Humanities to
                    handle the archive of one of its most important forefathers? To address these
                    questions, the presentation will first focus on the estate itself and then
                    describe the design and development of the "Indexer", a tool for the initial
                    indexing of technical information. Two especially problematic aspects are the
                    sheer mass of files (more than 1.5 million) and Kittler's idiosyncratic
                    organization, both of which serve to make conventional content evaluation very
                    difficult. Here, the "Indexer" has proven to be a powerful tool. Finally, a case
                    study using the indexer's web interface will enable us to tackle the question:
                    When and to what purpose did Friedrich Kittler acquire a computer?</p>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In summer of 1992, still holding the chair of "New German Literature" at the Ruhr
                    University Bochum, Friedrich Kittler announced a weekly colloquium for advanced
                    students "Literature and Computer Sciences I", followed by "Literature and
                    Computer Sciences II" the next semester. Later, at the Humboldt University in
                    Berlin where his chair was called "History and Aesthetics of Media", until his
                    retirement in 2008, Kittler customarily dedicated two of his eight-hour teaching
                    load to computer studies. "Graphic programming in C" in summer of 1994 actually
                    started out as a "crash course" [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1994">Kittler 1994</a>] in basic knowledge
                    of the von-Neumann design and the language C. The curriculum went on to
                    Assembler-classes. In the mid 1990s the courses served to get a Silicon Graphics
                    workstation into operation. (This worked out for some of his students, not for
                    Kittler.) <em class="term">Computer acoustics</em> was addressed by the end of the
                        nineties.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3384e196">[1]</a> At least officially, since there was no rigid syllabus.
                    Instead, each participant would bring up what he (there seldom was a she) was
                    working on, e.g. developing maze-solving algorithms inspired by Claude Shannon’s
                    toys, Markov chains for a Mind Reading Machine or a card indexer [<a class="ref" href="#krajewski2011">Krajewski 2011</a>, 35–36]. Kittler’s own long term interest was
                    in raytracing and radiosity, two alternative procedures for generating computer
                    graphics. Raytracing algorithms calculate paths and angles of light beams
                    resulting in the pixel-by-pixel buildup of brilliant hyper realistic pictures;
                    radiosity algorithms calculate diffuse reflections from various objects
                    resulting in a growing luminosity within a given picture. Whereas the
                    mathematics involved in raytracing operate with the laws of light reflection and
                    refraction known since antiquity and elaborated by differential calculus in
                    the 17th century, radiosity is based on the cosine law Johann Heinrich Lambert
                    formulated in his <cite class="title italic">Photometria</cite> (1760) and on 19th century
                    thermodynamics. The <span class="foreign i">gaia scienza</span> fostered by Kittler comprehended the history of
                    computing as it began long before the computer was invented.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">What started out as a major call to all of his graduating, graduated, and post-doc
                    students to fight the notorious "computer illiteracy" which Kittler generally
                    blamed the Humanities for, soon shrank to a small elitist circle. As Markus
                    Krajewski, one of the happy few, summarizes, "Kittler wanted to establish a real
                    computer literacy. And our group was both the justifying nucleus of this demand
                    and his evidence of possibility." [<a class="ref" href="#krajewski2011">Krajewski 2011</a>, 35]</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">Within the broad field of intersections between Computer Sciences and Humanities
                    comprised by the Digital Humanities today, Kittler’s teachings may well grant
                    him the title of a forefather. However, there is a certain restriction. Kittler
                    did not take part in the development of any of the fabulous tools that today
                    make Digital Humanities a flourishing interdisciplinary research field. Even
                    worse: From a media-theoretical viewpoint Kittler’s notorious statement "There
                    Is No Software" ultimately questions DH’s right to exist. From a practical
                    viewpoint, however, in 1992, he seems to have pronounced another call of
                    Cassandra’s. The "postmodern Tower of Babel", e.g. the hierarchy of software
                    layers operating like one-way functions without the possibility of tracing their
                    operations back or down to the hardware [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1992">Kittler 1992</a>, 221];
                        [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1991a">Kittler 1991a</a>, 210–211] has piled up higher and higher.
                    What in the early 1990s was analyzed as the cryptography of programming
                    languages, today has escalated in digital objects and services, cloud-networking
                    and distributed processing. Still, there is no working around Kittler’s bottom
                    line, that is to say that Turing’s paper machine set the "principal switch of
                    all possible discrete computers" [<a class="ref" href="#kittler2006a">Kittler 2006a</a>, 59] and all
                    hardware design still is von Neumann-architecture.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3384e245">[2]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The historical, theoretical and political dimensions of Kittler’s "provocative
                    insight" [<a class="ref" href="#parikka2015">Parikka 2015</a>] have been discussed and may inspire
                    further discussion [<a class="ref" href="#winthrop-young2011">Winthrop-Young 2011</a>, 73–81]; [<a class="ref" href="#parikka2015">Parikka 2015</a>]; [<a class="ref" href="#feigelfeld2015">Feigelfeld 2015</a>]. What is important
                    to note here is Kittler’s paradox of denouncing the non-existence of software
                    while passionately producing it. It leads to the question of what kind of computer
                    literacy he aimed at. The answer is not encouraging. Since Turing, as Kittler
                    repeatedly praised him for, was the last programmer to prefer reading machine
                    out-put in 0s and 1s to decimal computations [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1992">Kittler 1992</a>, 223], the next level within the grasp of an ordinary human brain is
                    assembly language, which only uses commands that correspond to the machine’s
                    code instructions. The closeness to the hardware comes at the price of an
                    increasing loss of portability (this is why, for ordinary use, C or C++ were
                    okay). Kittler’s cure hardly seems recommendable today. Anyone who has ever been
                    attracted to give up one’s humanity and become a machine will have to face that
                    the hardware development ever more expands underneath the aforesaid Tower.
                    Raytracing and Radiosity algorithms, for example, nowadays are implemented or
                        "sunk–in"<a class="noteRef" href="#d3384e282">[3]</a> chips.</div>

                    daunting godfather.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3384e299">[4]</a> In discussions about what Digital Humanities might
                    be, not as a scattered field of applied studies amending the toolbox of the
                    "old" Humanities, but as an academic discipline with a programmatic approach in
                    its own right, there is constant reference to Kittler. Interestingly, the clue
                    here is his habilitation treatise on literature <cite class="title italic">Discourse Networks 1800 /
                        1900</cite>. In the afterword to the second edition, Kittler defines the
                    term as "the network of technologies and institutions that allow a given culture
                    to select, store, and process relevant data" [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1990a">Kittler 1990a</a>, 369]. While this definition surely offers a common ground, the
                    question arises whether "updating Friedrich Kittler’s media analysis" to a
                    "discourse network 2000" [<a class="ref" href="#liu2004">Liu 2004</a>, 50] is possible and
                    further whether Kittler’s approach is apt to fulfill such a claim [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>, viii], [<a class="ref" href="#kirschenbaum2008">Kirschenbaum 2008</a>, 5–6].</div>

                    the latter seems to be "in need of historiography," as Claus Pias recently
                    ascertained. To provide an epistemological account of Kittler's theory the
                    task of historians has to start with "dating (its) underlying

                    product of the American hacker’s movement of the 1970s. In the 1980s the
                    hacker’s culture of bricolage and hands-on reached its peak and came to a
                    historical closing as the hardware spread all over the desks of Western homes.
                    The "hacker" turned into "a historical figure."<a class="noteRef" href="#d3384e358">[5]</a> While Kittler,
                    according to Pias, played around with the personal computer just like innumerous
                    teenagers did at the time, he was unique in that he was able to conceptualize
                    it. In the computer he found the logical and material inherent or built-in media
                    theory [<a class="ref" href="#pias2011">Pias 2011</a>, 38–40].</div>

                    it is utterly wrong. Pias simply forgot to ask the question that Matthew

                    a "Harmonizer" (i.e. a digital pitch-shifting device) he built himself. The
                    latter he actually refers to as "computers", since in the end he started using

                <h1 class="head">Conclusion</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">This first overview of Kittler’s programming shows that exploring mathematics was
                    its genuine purpose. More precisely, it selected some branches of mathematics
                    close to the history or theory of computing. Marchov chains, via information
                    theory, form part of the media archeology of computers themselves. Fractal
                    geometry belongs to the theory of numbers and computability. The concept of
                    functions and the differential calculus, developed from the 18th century
                    onwards, Kittler regarded as the most powerful part of science mapping the
                    outlines of technology. Since there is no Platonic heaven, not even for
                    mathematics, media history’s task lays in deciphering and describing its
                    languages and notation systems as the basis of ideas. The condition of modern
                    technology depends on how the tools the history of mathematics bequeathed us
                    with are processed. They have to pass through the gates of Turing’s 0s and 1s
                    and emerge as programs or digital tools.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">The personal computer, I may conclude, was Kittler’s medium to "upload
                    mathematics." To him, the relevance of such an undertaking was out of question.
                    "Without the discovery of partial differentiation equations, no single modern
                    chip or radio receiver or transmitter could either be conceived or constructed" [<a class="ref" href="#kittler2006b">Kittler 2006b</a>, 34]. The same holds true for the
                    mathematics of the Internet or of smart phone apps, although these fields did
                    not lay within Kittler’s interest. Instead, his study turned to the history of
                    numbers and algorithms. This way of thinking could not be but inspired by
                    computers.
                <blockquote><p>Evidently, computer graphics and computer music 'first and foremost' continue
                    the modern traditions of linear perspective and tempered scale. They automatize
                    in the shape of algorithms certain regularities that from a historical point of
                    view are contingent achievements of European cultural history rather than
                    natural matters of course. The obvious question – albeit rarely posed – is
                    therefore which mathematical and technological junctures lead to these
                    algorithms that the 19th century subsequently proceeded into rigid mechanical
                    hardware (film, phonography, gramophones, etc.) and the 20th century into
                    programmable software? [<a class="ref" href="#kittler1999a">Kittler 1999a</a>, 143]</p></blockquote>.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Coming back to the question which effect did the use of the personal computer
                    have on Kittler’s media theory, perhaps too blunt an answer would be that it was
                    sublated. "Thinking" or "understanding" media requires mathematical information.
                    In the late 1990s a research program evolved to capture "mathematics as a
                    cultural force" [<a class="ref" href="#kittler2006b">Kittler 2006b</a>, 34]. This endeavor, finally,
                    led Kittler to ancient Greece where he listened to the call of the Sirens and
                    never returned. Of his last mammoth project <cite class="title italic">Music and
                    Mathematics</cite>, which was supposed to span from antiquity to "Turing-Time",
                    only the first two volumes could be finished.<a class="noteRef" href="#d3384e1252">[19]</a> Still, a "very

                    parts. The directory <span class="monospace">musik</span> contains a series of lectures "Musik und

                        Traces of Kittler’s "authorship" are discernable by the idiosyncratically
                        abbreviated German file names, by comments in slashes and, indeed, by style.
                        Some come with a documentation, e.g. "ROESSLER.C"’s source is
                        <span class="monospace">/*Becker/Dörfler, 76+291*/</span>, probably Karl-Heinz Becker’s and Michael

                        considered not worth keeping and tending. The file names of a group dating
                        from July 1989 give the idea of tentative steps: "EINFALT.C", "EINFOUR.C",
                            "EINHILB.C", "EININT.C", "EINPFT.C", etc. It’s highly speculative, but I would
                        read: "Euler in Fourier", "Euler in Hilbert" or simply "e in
