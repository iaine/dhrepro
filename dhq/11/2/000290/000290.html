                <p>We present a case study on visualizing a collection of historic drawings along
                    its metadata structure while also allowing for close examination of the
                    artifacts’ texture. With regards to the specific character of cultural heritage
                    at the intersection of research, education, and public interest, the presented
                    visualization environment aims at meeting the requirements of both researchers
                    as well as a broader public. We present the results from a collaborative
                    interdisciplinary research project that involved a cultural heritage foundation,
                    art historians, designers, and computer scientists. The case study examines the
                    potential of visualization when applied to, and developed for, cultural heritage
                    collections. It specifically explores how techniques aimed at visualizing the
                    quantitative structure of a collection can be coupled with a more qualitative
                    mode that allows for detailed examination of the artifacts and their contexts by
                    displaying high-resolution views of digitized cultural objects with detailed art
                    historical research findings. Making use of latest web technologies, the
                    resulting visualization environment allows for dynamic filtering and zooming of
                    a collection of visual resources that are arranged along a contextualized
                    timeline. We share insights from our collaborative design process and the
                    feedback and usage data gathered during the deployment of the resulting
                    prototype as a web application. We end with a discussion of transferability of
                    carefully crafted and collaboratively negotiated visualizations of cultural
                    heritage and raise questions concerning the applicability of our approach to
                    related strands of humanities research.</p>

                <h1 class="head">1. Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">In recent years, numerous projects have been initiated and funded that aim to
                    digitize cultural artifacts. Archives, museums, libraries, and other heritage
                    institutions are now facing the challenge to make digitized inventories publicly
                    accessible and provide new modes of engagement with the cultural content. At the
                    same time, there is an increase in visualization research related to the digital
                    humanities that explores computational and data-driven approaches to literature,
                    art, and other cultural domains. The asset of computational analysis and
                    visualization is often reduced to their benefit in regards to quantitative
                    analysis, which implies a distancing from the singular object or phenomenon. At
                    the same time, the object-centered nature of museums, art history, archeology,
                    and archives is fueling a growing interest in harmonizing digital approaches
                    with qualitative and interpretative methods, i.e., "close
                        viewing" or "close reading," an approach that
                    we aim to extend with this work.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">The case study<a class="noteRef" href="#d19923e242">[1]</a> that we present shows the potential of applying techniques
                    largely drawn from information visualization to an art historical source. With a
                    zoomable visualization environment we seek to explore how a
                        "distant-viewing" approach can be combined with a
                        "close-viewing" mode in a dynamic and contextualized
                    arrangement (see Fig. 1). We aim to examine how visualizing the quantitative
                    structure of a collection can be complemented by allowing for examination of the
                    qualitative texture of the individual object. We describe a design space for
                    visualizing cultural collections that also does justice to the aesthetic value
                    of the collection and objects. Our contributions further include an evaluation
                    of the prototype in regards to usability, user interaction, and audience
                    groups.</div>

                    digital humanities, the emerging field of digital art history, and
                    visualizations particularly developed for cultural collections.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">The analysis of textual data has been an important method for the largely
                    language-centric digital humanities [<a class="ref" href="#janicke2015">Jänicke et al. 2015</a>] and a major
                    strand of research in information visualization [<a class="ref" href="#kucher2014">Kucher and Kerran 2014</a>].
                    While early text visualizations were created for relatively abstract use
                    contexts, more recent work focuses on specific needs of particular user groups
                    such as humanities scholars [<a class="ref" href="#janicke2015">Jänicke et al. 2015</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#koch2014">Koch et al. 2014</a>]. The scope of visualization tools for textual analysis
                    ranges between single-purpose tools [<a class="ref" href="#wattenberg2008">Wattenberg and Viégas 2008</a>] to
                    comprehensive analysis environments  [<a class="ref" href="#muralidharan2013">Muralidharan and Hearst 2013</a>].
                    Moretti’s notion of "distant reading" [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>] has become a provocative yet productive term to
                    negotiate quantitative and qualitative methods of literary history, and more
                    generally for interpreting cultural data. The distinction between close and
                    distant readings has informed a wide range of visualization projects aiming to
                    support analysis that ranges from individual words and sentences to documents
                    and entire corpora [<a class="ref" href="#janicke2015">Jänicke et al. 2015</a>].</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">Apart from these predominantly text-based efforts in digital humanities, the
                    broader context of digital cultural heritage has attracted a variety of
                    experimental visualization research and innovative design of collection
                    interfaces. Visualizations of cultural heritage collections promise to offer
                        "rich-prospect interfaces" that represent an entire
                    collection at once, afford interactive control over its arrangement, and provide
                    detailed access to its elements [<a class="ref" href="#ruecker2011">Ruecker et al. 2011</a>]. This approach is
                    based on the principle that the default interface should "show a meaningful representation […] of every single
                            item in the collection"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#ruecker2011">Ruecker et al. 2011</a>] that is apparent to the user and helps them to understand, on a visual
                    basis, what is available in a collection. Image plots of thousands of Instagram
                    photos arranged by time and hue fulfil some of these aspirations in that they
                    blend the representation of the metadata with the visual qualities of the images
                        [<a class="ref" href="#hochman2013">Hochman and Manovich 2013</a>]. The resulting visualizations offer impressions
                    of large stocks of photos that were not visible in that way before. The
                    Viewshare tool was explicitly designed for rapid creation of visual interfaces
                    that can be used to explore and share patterns in collection data using
                    established techniques such as maps, timelines, and lists [<a class="ref" href="#algee2012">Algee et al. 2012</a>]. In contrast, the "Bohemian
                        Bookshelf" interface contains deliberately idiosyncratic
                    visualizations each offering a unique point of entry to a visually rich and
                    multidimensional collection [<a class="ref" href="#thudt2012">Thudt et al. 2012</a>]. The principle of
                        "generosity" can be used to qualify to which degree an
                    interface reveals the material and semantic qualities of a collection and
                    encourages its exploration [<a class="ref" href="#whitelaw2015">Whitelaw 2015</a>]. Our research aims to
                    contribute to this line of work on generous and rich-prospect interfaces for
                    cultural collections in particuarly by supporting the shift between abstract,
                    distanced explorations and highly detailed close-up views.</div>

                    fields of research in that sense that the visual object of study had to be
                    translated into text (e.g. on index cards or in cataloguing systems and
                    databases) to be able to retrieve relevant information from rich collections,
                    either analog or digital. Efforts in computation and digital humanities research
                    thus also include the improvement of ontologies and text-based information

                    the arts and humanities are not about absolute truths, they are constructed to

                    in the question of how the underlying textual-digital fragmentation of an
                    artifact influences our perception of digital cultural heritage on a more
                    general note. These discourses engage, amongst others, with the question of how
                    to address, represent or preserve the materiality of objects in digital
                    representations. This is especially relevant in the context of museums that, for
                    a long time, have given primacy to the materiality of objects. Nonetheless,
                    within museum studies, and the study of material culture in general, the notion
                    of "object biographies" has come to acknowledge the ways in
                    which objects become invested with meaning through the social interactions they
                    are caught up in [<a class="ref" href="#gosden1999">Gosden and Marshall 1999</a>]. This shift away from a strict
                    focus on materiality and towards a notion that understands the accumulation and
                    transformation of an object’s meaning and values as a distinctly sociocultural
                    process can now also be accentuated in the context of digital cultural heritage.
                    Objects, in this sense, can be recognised as being in a state of motion, that
                    might occupy or migrate through different states and media [<a class="ref" href="#parry2007">Parry 2007</a>]. Nonetheless, debates on the meaning, value, and
                    presence of digital objects, quite often still rely on the object-centeredness
                    of museum culture and thus argue from the standpoint of the
                        "superior" physical counterpart of the digital object
                        [<a class="ref" href="#cameron2007">Cameron 2007</a>]. In this context, we would like to acknowledge
                    that the materiality of a museum object could also be problematised even in
                    regards to how it is conveyed in a museum display. Although museums can be
                    regarded as "material institutions par excellence"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#dudley2012">Dudley 2012</a>], they often limit the extent to which people can engage with the things
                    on display and thus likewise limit the access to the objects’ materiality [<a class="ref" href="#dudley2012">Dudley 2012</a>]. Naturally, this restricted access is a due measure
                    of precaution that ensures the preservation of valuable and unique objects.
                    Nonetheless, neither in a physical nor digital display can we touch, feel,
                    smell, taste, or weigh the objects with the help of all our senses. What we have
                    to rely on in both instances is our sense of vision and, if provided, the
                        "knowledge" assigned to the (digital) object by the
                    museum as metadata or other additional information [<a class="ref" href="#dudley2012">Dudley 2012</a>].
                    Concerning the influence of new media on our way of perceiving and engaging with
                    cultural heritage, Jeff Malpas has remarked that we need to retain a sense of
                    the materiality of objects "understood in terms of the way in which human life is
                            essentially formed and articulated, and so also understood, in relation

                        senses. For one, we embrace the differences in disciplinary backgrounds as
                        part of a "culture"<a class="noteRef" href="#d19923e510">[2]</a> within e.g.

                        from the premise that these cultures should be equally included, respected,
                        and brought to their full potential in any transdisciplinary project. This
                        could be affiliated with the notion that "cultural
                            sensitivity" (in the more common meaning of the term) involves
                        acknowledging "sensitivity to the importance of cultural

                        sensibility towards "culture" (or the cultural artefact)
                        in regards to the collection that we engage with. More precisely, by using
                        this term in its double meaning, we seek to emphasize that the cultural
                        content, meaning, and specific qualities of a collection and its items would
                        be the driving force while developing and designing the visualization in
                        close collaboration and on the basis of mutual respect with the heritage
                        institution and the different involved disciplines. Hence, our approach is

                        metadata might include genre, style, or iconographic classification. While

                        (as our cooperating institution) still rely on manually annotating their
                        collections. Some subsets from the foundation’s collection databases do
                        involve descriptive or interpretative texts, research findings, and other
                        related resources, while other areas of the collections are almost untapped.

                        drawings by the King that are in the process of being inventoried and
                        digitized. Many of these sheets reveal the planning eye of the King in the
                        form of architectural visions and dreamy drafts while they bear witness to
                        historical events such as wars and revolutions, literary influences or

                        collaboration with the heritage institution was a workshop framework that
                        practically and conceptually engages participants from various professions
                        in thinking about how different facets of a collection could be translated

                        no designated thematic focus, but rather served as a platform to get to know
                        the scope of the partnering institution, the collections, the database
                        structure, and allowed us to identify promising areas for a first case
                        study.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p19">19</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p19">The workshop format provides a setting, in which the participants
                        individually create collages from sample material with the aim to tease out
                        promising relationships among objects (see Fig. 2). The workshop was
                        documented (as audio recordings of the discussions, photographs of paper
                        collages and the making process). These records were later transcribed and
                        thematically clustered. By analyzing the material, we were able to identify
                        prevailing topics of interest and challenges that were relevant for the
                        subsequent steps of our project. First of all, most approaches to the
                        collections that were developed during the workshop were of qualitative
                        nature. Participants presented collages and discussed ideas that highlighted
                        content-based facets or interpretational elements. Thus, the collages
                        resembled an approach that is mostly associated with a curatorial practice
                        in museums. When discussing these approaches, a challenge was seen in the
                        fact that the existing metadata and level of digitization of the
                        foundation’s collections often did not include such content keywords and
                        in-depth descriptive elements and interpretational texts.</div>
                    <div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">Following this first workshop that identified mutual interests, we analyzed
                        the overall metadata structures of the collections that had already been
                        digitized. As a result, the thematic focus on the drawings by Frederick
                        William IV was influenced by the quality of the digital copies, the thorough
                        and complete art historical metadata, as well as the fact that the metadata
                        included descriptive and interpretational texts. The second workshop was
                        then specifically aimed at identifying promising structures and parameters
                        within this sub-collection of drawings that could serve as a dimension for
                        an exploratory visualization environment. With this specific goal in mind,
                        we invited not only colleagues from our department with a background in
                        interface design and information visualization, but also a scientific editor
                        of the foundation and the art historian that led the research group which
                        produced the metadata. According to our overall goal to proceed on the
                        notion of "cultural sensitivity," the identification and
                        involvement of the right domain experts was a central element of our
                            cooperation [<a class="ref" href="#sedlmair2012">Sedlmair et al. 2012</a>]. With this, we act on the
                        observation that digital research in areas like art and cultural heritage
                        often demonstrates inferior or uncertain cognitive value of the findings
                        when it is not informed by professional art historical knowledge and
                        scholarly methodology [<a class="ref" href="#bentkowskakafel2015">Bentkowska-Kafel 2015</a>]. The collages
                        that were produced during the second workshop were much more specific and
                        related to the actual data and scope of the collection. During an iterative
                        process, we then identified dimensions and parameters that were both
                        appealing from an art historical point of view and offered interesting
                        challenges for visualization research and design.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p21">21</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p21">Our collaborators repeatedly emphasized the temporal and thematic patterns to be
                    particularly important for making sense of the collection. In addition, there
                    was an interest in incorporating the actual reproductions of the drawings in the
                    visualization. This corresponds with the assertion that visualizations,
                    especially in the context of digital humanities, should take into account the
                    unique visual and material qualities of digitized collections to reflect their
                    physical counterparts [<a class="ref" href="#hinrichs2016">Hinrichs et al. 2016</a>]. Obviously, the digital
                    cannot surmount the restricted access to materiality posed upon a museum object.
                    Nonetheless, we can try to at least tap into the full potential of displaying a
                    digitized museum object and still be aware that much of what constitutes the
                    display and the ways of engaging with the object is based on the interpretation
                    and not on its spatio-temporal materiality. Reflecting on these conditions, we
                    have found it to be productive for our research to try and exhaust the given
                    technological potentials in making high-resolution reproductions of fragile (and
                    mostly non-public) objects available to the public. Thus, we hope to at least
                    maximise the visual information about the material qualities that can be
                    extracted from the digital collection at hand, maybe even surpassing the
                    accessibility of the original that would be shielded from the public with "glass cases, picture frames, ropes"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#dudley2012">Dudley 2012</a>], or other visually distancing precautionary measures. At the same time,
                    we concede that it is not solely the physical materiality of the objects that
                    affect the conditions under which we can engage with the collection by
                    subjugating the arrangement of the visual resources to their interpretation (of
                    temporal, contextual, or thematic attributes). The aforementioned challenge of
                    conveying the materiality of digitial cultural heritage also influenced our
                    decision-making in regards to the treatment and processing of the digitized
                    drawings. We decided to preserve and highlight the traces of materiality that
                    are conveyed through the high-resolution digital reproductions, such as
                    ripped-out corners, faded-out strokes, and the proportions of the sheets and
                    differences in size. Following our aims and research questions, we have devised
                    a zoomable visualization environment that arranges a collection of drawings
                    based on their temporal attribution, allows for thematic filtering, provides
                    historical and art historical context, and enables the close inspection of the
                    high-resolution images and their visual texture.</div>

                    dark screen canvas and muted colors takes into account the collection’s texture.
                    Many prints, engravings, or drawings are monochromatic and low in contrast. This
                    also being the case for the collection of drawings by Frederick William, a light
                    screen canvas would have blended the drawings with their background. Since the
                    original sheets were furthermore digitized mounted to a dark carrier paper, the
                    contrast between the light sheets of paper and the dark carrier paper, that
                    extends to the screen canvas, makes it possible to discern the cut-outs and
                    texture of the paper more easily. Additionally, the physical context of the
                    original drawings can be associated with the interface, since the design reminds
                    of the dim and concentrated aesthetics of print rooms in museums. In the

                        not have an exact year, but rather estimated time ranges, the median of the
                        range is used for the positioning. Within the columns, sheets are sorted
                        vertically based on the complexity of their metadata. Since Frederick
                        William often used one piece of paper for several independent sketches or

                        historical and biographical context to the drawings were in part derived
                        from the existing exhibition catalogue and collaboratively authored with our
                        partners at the foundation. In order to facilitate the establishment of a
                        connection between the personal and historical developments and the drawings
                        that the King produced at the time, the timeline is positioned right below
                        the columns of drawings. The timeline implements a semantic zoom

                        arguably follows a quantitative logic, the integration of the actual digital
                        copies of the drawings and the annotated timeline provide qualitative

                        Similar to image plots of photos or magazine covers [<a class="ref" href="#hochman2013">Hochman and Manovich 2013</a>]

                        reveal global patterns and trends, however, typically only general shades
                        and shapes can be differentiated. Our intention is to make these
                        arrangements dynamic through filtering and thus allow for rapid access to
                        custom subsets of the collection. The canvas is designed as a continuously
                        zoomable space, allowing for the gradual increase of detail for particular
                        segments of the arrangement of images. Zoom operations can be carried out
                        either through the mouse wheel or by performing scrolling or zoom gestures
                        on touchpads and touch-enabled displays. By zooming into particular groups
                        of images, the thumbnails continuously grow into larger images with a higher
                        resolution. By clicking and dragging, it is possible to pan the canvas in
                        all directions. The viewer can examine sheets in the same year by performing
                        vertical movements and shift in time between different year columns by
                        moving horizontally. By clicking or tapping on an image, it is possible to
                        immediately focus on this particular drawing and display it in high
                        resolution. Once an image is in focus, the neighboring images fade out and
                        the detail information becomes available on the right side panel. In the
                        same visual context of the canvas, it is now possible to further zoom into
                        the image of the drawing to closely inspect the texture of the paper and
                        even the grain of the pencil strokes (see Fig. 5, bottom left). These

                        the canvas (see Fig. 5). Once one image is viewed individually, the highest
                        resolution is retrieved (5000 pixels), which allows the viewer to see

                    settings and with a range of audiences. Besides regularly discussing the
                    prototype with our collaborators, we also presented it to other domain experts
                    at network meetings, public talks, or research colloquiums and collected their
                    responses and questions. At an earlier stage of development, the visualization
                    was shown during an exhibition in Berlin under the title "Past Visions of the Future City—Exploration of drawings penned by Frederick
                        William IV of Prussia," putting an emphasis on the subset of drawings
                    that depict architectural and urban planning visions for Berlin and Potsdam.
                    Visitors mainly identified as being from the visualization and design community,
                    but also as groups of museum professionals. Still, there was a good balance with
                    spontaneous visitors from the neighborhood and surrounding areas with no
                    expertise in neither one of the fields. Most exhibition visitors had no, or only
                    little, knowledge of Prussian history or the King’s life. Accordingly, one
                    particular insight from conversations with visitors was their desire to also
                    learn more about Frederick William’s personal life or the political developments
                    of his time that had an influence on the drawings and sketches.Thus, we decided

                    and other relatable information that would help to comprehend the collection
                    with little prior knowledge about the subject matter. By presenting these
                    earlier stages of the prototype in controlled environments and with the
                    potential to engage in conversations with domain experts or the general public,
                    we were able to continuously react to feedback by our peers during the
                    development process and learn more about how different types of users react to
                    the visualization and interface. Finally, we deployed the visualization as a web

                        engagement with the visualization. Each relevant interaction parameter is
                        translated into a visual variable indicating the components of the interface
                        using color, temporal length as width, and the level of
                            "closeness" reached during the interaction as height.
                        Closeness is defined by the zoom level in the canvas and timeline as well as
                        by the number of keywords that were clicked and combined as a filter (thus
                        resulting in more refined results and only a few images displayed above the
                        timeline). The overall impression of the sequence visualization indicates
                        that people using the visualization in fact shifted between distanced
                        (small) and very detailed (tall) perspectives. A closer look on the sequence
                        visualization shows two distinct ways of bridging the different levels of
                        detail, one more gradual (triggered via zooming) and the other very abrupt
                        (triggered by clicks on individual images). Furthermore, the iterations
                        between canvas and timeline interactions are clearly visible by the
                        alternating red and orange blocks.</div>

                        statements on a Likert-scale (see Fig. 8). Regarding the usability of the
                        visualization, the assertion "While using the
                            visualization, I was able to easily find my way around the
                            interface" (question 7) reached a median agreement of 5 on a
                        scale from 0 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Accordingly, the
                        statement ,"the interface is difficult to
                            operate" only scored a median agreement of 2. While more detailed
                        user experience testing has to be conducted to identify more specific
                        problems and obstacles, these first usability results already show us a
                        tendency towards decent operability. The participants reported that they
                        were able to get an overview of the contents and objects of the
                        visualization (median agreement of 5), while it also invited them to explore
                        the scope of the themes and engage with unfamiliar topics (question 3 and
                        5). Thus, the questionnaire confirmed our analysis of the interaction
                        sequences, which had already shown a good balance between
                            "close" and "distant" viewing. The
                        questionnaire also showed that the visualization is not perceived as being
                        solely a research tool but suitable for people looking for a cultural
                        recreational activity (questions 10 and 11). Due to the fact that only five
                        of the respondents were not experts in arts, culture, design or
                        visualization, it would nonetheless need further evaluation in order to be
                        able to better assess if the visualization also works well for interested
                        laypersons.</div>

                        categories of recurring feedback: interaction, content, design, and general
                        observations. All of which covered a range from positive to negative

                            were remarked as being noteworthy by seven participants. Nonetheless,
                            although the basic interactions are illustrated in the information
                            sidebar of the interface, five participants reported experiencing
                            trouble while using the visualization. As an example, one person
                            misinterpreted the text labels as a selector for the images instead of a
                            filter and thus was irritated when no image "opened
                                in full size" [P3, 40-45 years, group 1] after clicking on a
                            tag. This was also the case for two other participants, stating that the
                            images were too small - although the visualization is indeed zoomable up
                            to a high-resolution image. The visual indicators on the info sidebar
                            and the a text panel in the single-image view (clickable arrows pointing
                            to the side that hide the panels for a full-screen view of the canvas
                            and images) seemed to be too subtle for some participants, since three
                            people stated that they e.g. "had wished to be able
                                to see a full-screen version of the images" [P28, 40-45
                            years, doctorate degree, group 2] without having the info sidebar or the
                            text panel block the view. In one instance, the panning was perceived as
                            cumbersome. One person remarked that the zoom interaction depends on a
                            scroll wheel or touchpad and thus might exclude users that use other
                            hardware. This concurs to the call for being able to interact with the

                            artistic talent of the King, as well as his interest in architecture,
                            were pointed out as being memorable and impressive by seven people. The
                            King’s repeated journeys to Italy were among the discoveries pointed out
                            by several participants.<blockquote><p class="ptext">Well, up to now I have not
                                engaged much with Frederick William IV. In this respect I definitely
                                learned something new. This is a nice method for learning in a
                                discovery-mode. [P40, 45-50 years, group 3].</p></blockquote>The timeline was
                            perceived as novel and descriptive (4x) and deemed to be well suited for
                            the thematic scope (1x). One person pointed out that the descriptions
                            and art historical comments were very valuable for research purposes but
                            might be deterring for laypersons. Another person found the
                            visualization in itself interesting but not the content of it. One
                            person alludes to a key question of visualization in the humanities, how
                            to reveal what is missing or uncertain: <blockquote><p class="ptext">The metadata
                                is great, but the visualization seems to focus on what is in there
                                and easily accessible, not what is needed to really be interesting
                                [P35, 35-40 years, group 3].</p></blockquote></li><li class="item"><em class="term">Design</em>. The combination of a timeline with entities of
                            different themes was pointed out and highlighted by one person as a
                                "pleasant stimulation" [P2, 40-45, group
                            1]. Being able to focus on a time of creation in relation to the themes
                            within the drawings, thus rapidly gaining an overview on what the king
                            was preoccupied with the most during what time, was also a feature that
                            was singled out (2x). One person found the visualization particularly
                            immersive: <blockquote><p class="ptext">I soaked up so much information in a
                                relative short amount of time and can now describe the setting of
                                this time period. I love the zooming and stumbling across this great
                                collection [P34, 30-35 years, doctorate degree, group 2].</p></blockquote>
                            The intersection of quantity and content with the drawings piled up as
                            bar chats was singled out as an interesting design feature (3x).</li><li class="item"><em class="term">General.</em> Along more general observations, one person
                            stated that the visualization created the urge to revisit it with more
                            time on hand to be able to delve into the images. The quality of the
                            images was positively remarked (2x), while another person pointed out
                            that the loading time of the high-resolution images was disruptive. A
                            remark on possible improvements made by two people was to include
                            full-text search. Other desired features were additional content linked
                            to the timeline and the images (2x), such as historical photos or a
                            geovisualization of the places and buildings depicted in the
                            drawings.</li></ul></div>

                        tool for art historical research. Thus, we asked one of the art historians
                        from the heritage foundation to assess if he or his colleagues are able to
                        derive insights by using the visualization. His feedback summarized the
                        advantages of the temporal arrangement and thematic filter functionality,
                        which creates curve progressions that are highly interesting for art
                        historical research. One significant example for this observation is
                        provided by the sheets covering Charlottenhof Palace. The shape created by
                        the bars along the timeline clearly shows the intensity with which the crown
                        prince worked on his later executed designs after receiving the estate by
                        his father in 1825. Other biographical or political events, such as his
                        marriage or the dawn of revolutions, equally left their traces in his
                        drawings. Thus, his intensive planning on the restructuring of his study and
                        his apartment can be related to his marriage and settling with his wife in
                        the Berlin city palace. Apart from being able to identify dominating themes,
                        the visualization could be instrumental in the effort of obtaining more
                        precise dating. One of the examples is the depiction of the German piked
                        helmet on some of the King’s drawings. The helmet was not used by the
                        Prussian Army earlier than 1843, allowing for a specification of time
                        assigned to some sheets that accumulate several drawings that were
                        interpreted and dated independently. From an expert point of view, the
                        visualization may provide an effective and powerful tool to refine and
                        verify previous art historical findings, datings, and examinations. </div>

                    art history [<a class="ref" href="#promey1997">Promey and Stewart 1997</a>] was self-evident throughout the process
                    of our research and the development of the visualization. Only by including
                    expert knowledge from the humanities as well as from interface design, computer
                    science, and data visualization we were able to reach a level of mutual
                    understanding for the relevant topics and challenges that were crucial to our
                    work. Pursuing the notion of "cultural sensitivity," the
                    content of the collection was the driving force during the design process.
                    Although the resulting visualization was not intended as a one-fits all solution
                    in the sense of a visualization tool that could be used unmodified for a broad
                    range of data sets, we recognized some promising aspects in the zoomable and
                    filterable canvas that can be transferred to other use cases beyond this
                    specific collection. In the following, we discuss some of our insights and
                    critically evaluate our use case with regard to the areas that would call for

                    of a collection of drawings that will eventually include more than 7000 sheets.
                    Knowing that the collection will be gradually digitized, we had to take into
                    account the scalability of our approach. Although we have already run some
                    preliminary tests with 7000 images, we would have to assess the performance of
                    the visualization when scaled to such a size more thoroughly. These questions of
                    scalability pave the way for transferring our approach to other image datasets
                    of varying sizes and metadata structures. While the use case was specifically
                    designed and developed for the drawings of Frederick William IV, the relatively
                    monochrome drawings with low contrast are weaker in a ‘distant’ viewing mode,
                    compared to images with higher contrast and a broader palette of colors. Thus,
                    in order to assess the general viability of transferring our framework, we ran
                    two trials with other data sets. For one, we explored about a thousand
                    paintings, drawings, and other artworks by Vincent Van Gogh<a class="noteRef" href="#d19923e892">[6]</a> (see Fig. 9). For the other, we
                    loaded 3915 items from the New York Public Library collection of Detroit
                    Publishing Company postcards<a class="noteRef" href="#d19923e896">[7]</a>.
                    Initial results indicate that images with a higher contrast and broader palette
                    of colors lend themselves well to exploration in a zoomable and filterable image
                    plot. For example, in the case of Van Gogh, not only quantitative insights about
                    the thematic distribution of works are visualized, but also their visual texture
                    can be examined, e.g., the dominance of darker colors in his early paintings
                    compared to brighter or more colorful shades in the later years becomes clearly
                    visible (see Fig. 9). Similarly, the potential of alternative layouts came up
                    during the iterative development. On the one hand, these layouts could be
                    particularly relevant to the specifics of a collection, for example, the
                    geographical distribution was suggested by participants of our study. On the
                    other hand, we are interested to see how the collection would behave in
                    similarity-based layouts (such as t-SNE) or grid layouts [<a class="ref" href="#klingemann2015">Klingemann 2015</a>] based on the metadata. Since the metadata is
                    based on in-depth art historical research along a controlled vocabulary,
                    similarity-based layouts may support the exploration of drawings by affinity. In
                    that sense, such layouts could translate the qualitative insights from the art
                    historical classification into a spatial arrangement.</div>

                    high level of completeness in regards to required metadata fields, depth of
                    assessment, and a standardized taxonomy, it lies in the nature of qualitatively
                    sourced data to implicate uncertainty, especially with regard to time [<a class="ref" href="#davis2015">Davis and Kräutli 2015</a>]. This also being the case for the subset of drawings
                    by Frederick William IV, discussing the issue with our project partners again
                    highlighted that this is not a problem that is possible to be solved, but that
                    needs to be addressed in the design of what might be called "humanistic interfaces"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2011">Drucker 2011</a>]. During the next iteration of the prototype, we hope to be able to futher
                    discuss and explore how timeline visualizations could visually reflect temporal
                    uncertainty. Even though we already decided to integrate additional contextual
                    information in the timeline—thus including data that had to be specifically
                    sourced and authored manually—some responses by participants in the
                    questionnaire showed that there is a desire for even more contextual data and
                    content from sources that go beyond the defined collection data set. Although
                    the problem was addressed as a general one in regards to cultural heritage
                    interfaces, considering the expansion of used sources and maybe even
                    implementing a layer for community co-creation and annotation (by using
                    folksonomy or crowdsourcing [<a class="ref" href="#ridge2014">Ridge 2014</a>]) could be valuable during
                    the next phase of the project. Nonetheless, the question of missing data also
                    has to be seen with regard to the reality and actual state of digitization in
                    most collecting institutions. The sheer amount of collection items, the costs of
                    the digitization process, and the need of expertise when assessing an item and
                    its metadata often make it hard for collecting institutions to meet such
                    requirements just yet.</div>

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p40">40</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p40">With this research we have explored the potential of zoomable visualizations of
                    cultural heritage collections. A collaborative design process with a heritage
                    institution resulted in a visualization technique, which is aimed at supporting
                    a "distant-viewing" approach coupled with a
                        "close-viewing" mode for the exploration of a historical
                    collection. We showed how visualizing the quantitative structure of a collection
                    can be complemented by allowing for examination of the qualitative texture of
                    the individual object. This work contributes insights to discourses on digital
                    heritage as well as on information visualization. In the early years, research
                    in the field of digital cultural heritage and the digital humanities was often
                    dominated by computational or technological solutions originally developed in
                    other fields and for other purposes. Following a shift towards digital heritage
                    research that puts the needs, challenges, and requirements of cultural heritage
                    in the focus and then seeks to find technological and computational solutions
                    for a mainly content-driven approach, we introduced our research in a sense of
                        "cultural sensitivity." At the same time, humanities
                    research that employs computational methods is often perceived as dominated by a
                    solely quantitative, positivist, or distant approach. Quantitative research in
                    the humanities, in turn, is often questioned on the notion of the alleged
                    necessity of qualitative examination in order to be able to truly grasp the
                    sources’ significance. This "quantitative-qualitative divide"
                    in the humanities, though, is not inherently a digitally inducted discord.
                    Empirical or quantitative methodologies existed in the humanities long before
                    the establishment of computers and web technologies in these fields [<a class="ref" href="#drucker2015">Drucker et al. 2015</a>]. Even in pre-digital humanities research, the
                    tendency to either value quantitative research over qualitative research or vice
                    versa already existed [<a class="ref" href="#macnealy1999">MacNealy 1999</a>]. Rather than carrying on an
                    antagonistic discourse of "close vs. distant,"
                    "qualitative vs. quantitative" under the slogan of
                        "digital vs. analog," there is an increasing recognition
                    of the potential in experimenting and engaging with digital technologies that
                    can help to actually unify these seemingly opposed strands, predominantly in
                    language-centric research [<a class="ref" href="#janicke2015">Jänicke et al. 2015</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#koch2014">Koch et al. 2014</a>]
                    [<a class="ref" href="#muralidharan2013">Muralidharan and Hearst 2013</a>]. With our research we expand on this notion
                    and apply it to a collection of visual resources. Our contributions thus are
                    relevant for the ever growing research activities in digital art history, as
                    well as a foundation for further work on visualization in the context of digital
                    cultural heritage.</div>
