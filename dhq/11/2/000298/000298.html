            <div id="abstract"><h2>Abstract</h2><p>For the past fifteen year, scholarly communication networks such as
                H-Soz-Kult – the German Information Service for Historians – and H-ArtHist – a
                specialized discussion and information network for art history based in Germany with
                an international reach – have been steadily publishing conference announcements and
                reports. Since both services were born digitally, starting with the listserv
                infrastructure of the Michigan based H-Net and later supplemented by database-driven
                web sites, the archives are easily accessible by electronic means. The aim of this
                paper is to demonstrate that the archives of scholarly communication provide a
                suitable basis for conducting an assessment of broad fields such as <em class="term">German
                historians</em> or <em class="term">German art history</em>, with relatively low technical effort. For the
                initial analysis of H-Soz-Kult<a class="noteRef" href="#d40636e152">[1]</a>, editorial practices facilitated the
                automated extraction of the speakers’ names as a key feature. But even in cases
                where no such special markup has been applied, freely available Web services such as
                    AlchemyAPI<a class="noteRef" href="#d40636e155">[2]</a>
                provide methods that can be used to achieve comparable results.<a class="noteRef" href="#d40636e161">[3]</a></p></div>

                    Though Manovich’s program of cultural analytics makes strong use of visual

                    revealing relevant insights into the disciplinary culture of historians as

                    results by using optimized stop word lists both for most and least frequent
                    terms in the corpus. In addition, word stemming or morphological analysis and
                    moving to a bilingual topic model (of the 3,537 conference reports since 2008,
                    slightly less than 3,000 are in German, the rest are in English) might avoid enough
                    of the irritations just described and thus make the clusters readable [<a class="ref" href="#mimno2012">Mimno 2012</a>].</div>

                    2008 on, the names of all conference speakers have been emphasized in all
                    upper-case letters (e.g. HANS BLOMME). By using a relatively simple regular
                    expression matching at least two consecutive words in all caps, an extensive
                    list of more than 30,000 speakers lecturing at over 3,500 conferences could be

                    from less to more active speakers in our set, we gained valuable insights into

                    conferences held throughout Western Europe, especially the UK. For the US, we
                    note a striking difference: While more than fifteen percent of the subscribers are
                    based in that country, only 8% of the conferences announced are held in the US.
                    Two factors may account for this difference: many of the influential art history
                    departments belong to private universities, and there is simply no tradition of
                    widely circulating information about conferences. In addition, conferences as
                    announced on H-ArtHist are closely tied to a third-party driven mode of research
                    less common in the humanities in North America. For France and Italy, we observe
                    the opposite relation: They show more prominently among conference locations
                    than would be expected from the subscribers’ share. This is mainly due to the
                    three independent German art history institutes abroad with an active and
                    actively announced conference schedule, the Kunsthistorisches Institut in
                    Florence, Bibliotheca Hertziana in Rome, and the Deutsches Forum für

                    GND-identifiers were manually researched for the 1,000 speakers with most
                    conference appearances, we can be reasonably sure that namesakes are a

                    this is not the case for H-ArtHist’s conference announcements. Therefore, key
                    figures in the historiography of the arts such as Giorgio Vasari, Walter
                    Benjamin and Aby Warburg showed up prominently among the most active persons and
                    have to be manually flagged as non-speaker entities. H-Soz-Kult also
                    differentiates between persons acting as speakers and those welcoming the
                    attendants or taking part in the discussion. Clearly separating these roles can
                    be difficult even for a human reporter: when does a welcome note turn into an
                    introduction; what is the difference of a respondent’s statement compared to a
                    far-reaching question during the discussion?</div>

                    (H-Soz-Kult: median of 13, average: 8.62, H-ArtHist: median 14, average: 10.8).
                    This can partially explained by the observation that there are but a limited
                    number of reports on small conferences with just a few speakers (40 reports with

                    we finally move over to the more complex relations among persons studied through
                    the network of "co-speaker" relations. Since this network is defined by drawing
                    a tie between any two persons speaking at the same conference, we need to ask if
                    it is reasonable to assume that this tie implies some kind of social relation
                    between the two?<a class="noteRef" href="#d40636e576">[19]</a> As discussed before, a typical
                    conference consists of a bit more than ten speakers. So while we can never be
                    sure that a social interaction between all of the around 80 possible pairings
                    within such a group actually took place, the assumption, that there is at least
                    a strong interaction potential as part of the discussions, during the breaks
                    in-between sessions, as well as during a possible conference dinner, seems valid.
                    And even in cases where no such interaction took place, we can still assume some
                    sort of shared research interest since most conferences are organized around a
                    unifying theme.</div>

                    is certainly weaker than co-authorship, a relation we still only very rarely
                    observe in the humanities. On the other hand, our tie seems quite a bit stronger
                    than citations among different authors; a primarily intellectual connection
                    among them, which – at least in larger disciplines – only rarely implies a real
                    world social interaction.<a class="noteRef" href="#d40636e583">[20]</a></div>

                    a graph with 8,361 speaker nodes connected by more than 130,000 edges. For
                    H-ArtHist, the corresponding graph consists of 5,165 person nodes and a bit less

                    of the early modern period. On top of them (in this graph in blue), we find

                    additional insights to our analysis.<a class="noteRef" href="#d40636e626">[22]</a>
                    The one measure that led to interesting insights is the so called Eigenvector
                    centrality, a measure "assessing how well connected an individual is to the
                    parts of the network with the greatest connectivity."</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p41">41</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p41">Going back to the full network of H-Soz-Kult, one sees that the early modern
                    period shows a group of highly connected people (marked by the size of the
                    labels). This corresponds to the gateway function between the medieval and
                    modern periods as well as the tight connections among themselves. So it is
                    absolutely not surprising that the only working group of the German Historian’s
                    association organized around a specific period is the "Arbeitsgemeinschaft Frühe
                    Neuzeit." The opposite phenomenon can be observed among scholars from the
                    younger field of Transnational History and the recently emerging field of
                    "Visual History." The Eigenvector centralities of the most prominent actors from
                    these fields are significantly lower than those of comparable speakers from more
                    established fields showing a similar number of conference appearances. While a
                    high centrality core comparable to the early modern period is lacking in the
                    case of art history, we find similar patterns for the group of people with a low
                    centrality despite of frequent appearances: Australian Aboriginal Art or the
                    Materiality of Magic are clearly topics far off the beaten paths in the
                    discipline.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p42">42</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p42">Another fact worth investigating is the number of conference-"buddies". Is it
                    common to have two speakers that have lectured together at one or more
                    conferences before? A look at the graph from the H-Soz-Kult set below shows,
                    that edge weight is a rapidly decreasing distribution: In average, just two
                    speakers at a conference have lectured together before or will do this on a
                    follow-up conference in our set. Only six "couples" share six, and a single pair
                    belonging to the same University department appeared at eight conferences
                    together. Enduring relations seem to be a rare exception rather than the
                    norm.</div>

                    overlap between these events. Contrary to content-based similarity measures,
                    this metric is independent of the languages of the report: "Atom global:

                    the case of H-ArtHist has shown, readily available NER-services such as
                    AlchemyAPI are working reasonably well to get roughly comparable results on

                    a habilitation thesis. Therefore we cannot yet trace personal careers all the
                    way from the first conference appearance – usually at the beginning of a PhD –
                    all the way up to the appointment as a professor generally more than a decade

                    This dislike can at least partially be attributed to the incomplete measures of
                    currently available indices: Frank Bösch, the most prominent German historian in
                    our dataset, is listed with only 13 publications and 12 citations in Thomson
                    Reuter’s Web of Science. The resulting h-index of only 2 would probably be too
                    low to get tenure recommendation in most disciplines that value these measures.
                    Once we perform a similar search through Google Scholar which accounts for
                    monographic citations as well, both the number of publications and the h-index
                    rise by a magnitude to around 150 papers and an h-index of 17. As this single
