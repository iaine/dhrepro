                <p>In this article, we discuss a way for visualizing interactions or solidarities in
                    a past community. The method that we expound is derived from process-oriented
                    views used in the industry. Therefore, this attempt to adopt practices from
                    outside of the traditional humanities framework must be clearly justified in
                    terms of epistemological position and in terms of choice among the numerous
                    available tools. First, we try to define what the process term could mean in the
                    humanities; then we explain our choice of a representation; we also carry out
                    tests of our method on selected case studies to visualize and question scholarly
                    works. Last, we offer the reader a prototype that must be improved to produce
                    automatic visualization of particular situations.</p>

                <h1 class="head">Introduction</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p1">1</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p1">Designing tools that help visualize scholarly works and offer various
                    perspectives is undoubtedly one of the key features of the Digital Humanities.
                    Indeed, as explained by members of the <cite class="title italic">Republic of
                        Letters</cite> program, visualizing helps see things "we did not see before" and "get a better sense
                        of the overall shape and structure".<a class="noteRef" href="#d4137e213">[1]</a></div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p2">2</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p2">In this work, we discuss a "method of representation"<a class="noteRef" href="#d4137e222">[2]</a> that provides both a
                    pedagogical assistance and a synthetic tool for such visualizations. Indeed, we
                    propose to explore a core aspect in human organizations, namely the way they set
                    up, consciously or not, a process to structure their practices. In order to
                    highlight and characterize certain practices among others as a process, we
                    develop a rigorous "representation" that we fully expand with
                    the help of the latest web standards. In addition, we connect this
                    representation to a model of data open to any results of the same type. The
                    conclusions that we present here come from encounters between scholars and
                    experts in the quality of industrial processes. From the discussions between
                    these counterparts, finding a common language ideally based on clear rules, in
                    order to ensure a thorough understanding of each other, has emerged as a
                    necessity. What follows is thus intended for pedagogical purposes, but it could
                    also be regarded as a help to put new questions to the foreground.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p3">3</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p3">At first view there seems to be a tremendous distance between research on history
                    and the search for optimal processes that would minimize the ratios of
                    breakdowns and subsequently provide the high level of quality of an industrial
                    production. Yet, our will to learn from the work of one another has convinced us
                    that the notion of process was already present at various periods of time in
                    history. Since in the industrial context people have a long-term experience on
                    how to represent dynamic process-oriented situations from a start point to an
                    end point, we argue that, by means of a proper translation, it is then possible
                    to offer new perspectives on historical works, as long as they contain one or
                    more process dimensions. Furthermore, we assert that these perspectives pertain
                    to the Digital Humanities domain. Indeed, as Daniel Cohen says in his book
                        <cite class="title italic">Digital History,</cite> the digital in history mainly
                    points to a representation of historical materials and investigations with the
                    help of "new" technologies [<a class="ref" href="#cohen2006">Cohen and Rosenweig 2006</a>]. To expound our point, we expressed scholarship evidence in a
                    process-oriented way to bring it into Digital Humanities material. We chose the
                    production of knowledge as a first field for our methodological investigation to
                    show its pedagogical virtues. In this contribution, we assumed that the case
                    studies we present may be regarded as a set of more or less ordered, more or
                    less planned, more or less tacit processes. </div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p4">4</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p4">First, we would like to justify that assumption by reviewing works carried out by
                    historians and by showing that they could be visualized in terms of process.
                    Then we shall present some process-oriented representations and we will explain
                    the choice of one of them in particular. We will try to apply our methodology to
                    two particular works, dealing for the first one with information management and
                    for the second one with the industrial production of fabric. Last, dealing with
                    technicalities, we will show a way to translate our representation in a
                    technical fashion with the help of the last web standards and by presenting a
                    client-side prototype based on a specialized <cite class="title italic">JavaScript</cite> library.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="div div0">
                <h1 class="head">Process in the humanities</h1>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p5">5</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p5">In this work, we define a process as a set of activities bringing about a result,
                    performed with accuracy and full control by actors who may interact with each
                    other as the links of the same chain. This chain of connected activities forms
                    in a long or short period of time, consciously or not. All actors of such a
                    process pursue a common objective which implies solidarities and sociability.
                    Therefore, we argue that if we manage to disclose such processes from the past,
                    we obtain information about the way communities were organized. Thus, our
                    purpose in this article is to propose means and rigorous methodologies to
                    visualize such processes in history. We chose to rest upon works of historians
                    to illustrate our method, although we could also apply it to primary sources.
                    Indeed, once we have identified relevant processes to highlight interactions
                    between actors, we are ready to visualize them with the help of our tool and
                    subsequently to question our sources on the basis on what was revealed by that
                    new display.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p6">6</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p6">First, let us exemplify our point with cases that were studied by historians and
                    that are related to the production of knowledge.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p7">7</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p7">Many works of historians deal with the production of knowledge at various periods
                    (Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Enlightenment…) and in different areas
                    (Europe, the Islamic world, China…). In this section, we suggest that some
                    scholarly works could be represented in terms of process if we can agree to a
                    definition that would be both wide enough to model different situations and
                    sufficiently accurate to take into account the specificity of the humanities. In
                    a book published in 2000, Tiziano Dorandi analyzes various aspects of writing in
                    Greek and Roman Antiquity from the draft to the book edition [<a class="ref" href="#dorandi2000">Dorandi 2000</a>]. In particular, he examines the conditioning of
                    papyrus, the format of its sale (roll or sheet), and the subsequent impact on
                    the writing of the Ancients. Then, he tries to describe the composition of a
                    treatise: from the gathering of documentation to the note-taking in order to
                    build a collection of notes, the author reviews practices of famous ancient
                    writers, such as Cicero and Pliny the Elder. For instance, he indicates that
                    Pliny was used to first making his assistants take notes on wax tablets before
                    dictating his commentaries on a new physical support from well-ordered notes. He
                    also envisages the passage from the sketch to the note-taking and finally to the
                    edition of a book and its diffusion towards various readers. Dorandi’s well
                    documented study describes the production of knowledge by ancient writers
                    grounded on robust ways of making. This invites regarding that production in
                    terms of process, if we consider such as an accurate, very often repeated and
                    constantly improved manner of achieving a particular task.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p8">8</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p8">In an article entitled "Notes on Medieval Production and
                        Valuation in Late-Medieval Brittany", Diane Booton investigates the
                    different steps followed by a priest in early fourteenth century Brittany to
                    produce a missal and a psalter [<a class="ref" href="#booton2006">Booton 2006</a>]. The study is carried
                    out on the basis of "tax registers, ecclesiastical payment
                        ledgers and municipal account books." From these sources, the author
                    identifies several groups of actors who might have participated in the
                    elaboration of the work: parchment makers, papermakers, scribes, illuminators
                    and bookbinders. For each of these groups, the author gives precise information
                    about its internal organization and its interaction with its social and economic
                    environment. For example, we learn that the wages paid to skilled and
                    experienced scribes represented a great amount in the total cost of the
                    production of a manuscript. We understand that the scribes were organized as a
                    team led by a coordinator who might also be in charge of "contracting with a music annotator, illuminator, bookbinder." If we
                    see this situation in terms of process, we can assert that a process is
                    something which has the property to be connected. Indeed, the different groups

                    genre, date, nationality or origin of the authors. This work is inscribed in the
                        "distant reading" program as defined by Franco
                    Moretti in his <cite class="title italic">Graphs, Maps, Trees</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="#moretti2005">Moretti 2005</a>]. In the chapter dedicated to <cite class="title italic">Trees</cite>, Moretti rests on Darwin’s <cite class="title italic">Origin of
                        Species</cite>, and specifically on the <cite class="title italic">Divergence of
                        Character</cite> section to analogously address the issue of literary
                    survival. He chooses British detective fiction as a field of investigation and
                    builds a tree to distinguish the novels that use clues from others, which
                    enables him to highlight that the latter ones were all forgotten. In the second
                    level of branching, he refines the character of divergence and classifies novels
                    with necessary clues and not necessary etc… This tree accounts for literary
                    transformation under the "pressure of social
                        selection". As in Darwinian evolution, that transformation seems to
                    be the result of a long-term <em class="emph">process</em> of which the causal factors
                    must be identified and analyzed. In that case, the "process
                        term" refers to a "natural" evolution not
                    deliberately ordered nor commanded by a community of human beings. For that
                    reason, the tree diagram acts as a classification scheme according to a certain
                    criterion, that is, the divergence of a character. It represents the outcome of
                    one or more underlying processes the nature of which we do not know. But, this
                    tree diagram describes in no way a process in action. Indeed, mapping relations
                    between Renaissance scholars or building tree diagrams such as above reports the

                    disclose the atomic dimensions of the situations we investigate. Thus, we
                    consider interactions between elements that may be either individuals or

                    output ones [<a class="ref" href="#oakes2013">Oakes 2013</a>]. Thus, an organization or a collective
                    activity may be modeled as a set of processes evolving in an external
                    environment (represented by constraints that must be respected) focused on a
                    specific objective. The interaction between processes may be regarded as a
                    communication channel in which a flow circulates. It raises the problem of the
                    relevancy of these modern concepts for representing works in history such as
                    those briefly described above. In fact, we do not mean to represent the past
                    world but only "to construct an interpretative
                        framework" for accounting situations described in scholarly works.
                    This "epistemological" position is clearly related to
                    the status of modeling in the humanities. Following Michael Gavin, we argue that
                    our process-based model "do[es] not represent the past, but
                        our ideas about the past" and, in our case, ideas derived from
                    scholarly works [<a class="ref" href="#gavin2014">Gavin 2014</a>]. Therefore, when we talk about
                        "representation", we mean a way of representing the
                    processes that constitute our "interpretative framework". As
                    a matter of fact, modeling in the humanities does not appear as a novel
                    activity: for example, using "categories to delimit a
                        conception of the world" is already an activity of modeling [<a class="ref" href="#gavin2014">Gavin 2014</a>]

                    activity, gateway and connection elements. The event elements (represented by a
                    circle) denote something that happens: the Start event is the process trigger
                    whereas the End event is the result of the process. The activity elements
                    (rounded corner rectangles) describe the work that must be done. The gateway
                    elements (diamond shapes) determine forking and merging of paths depending on
                    conditions (exclusive, event evaluation, inclusive…). All these elements are
                    linked by connection elements (sequence, message passing, and association) to
                    describe the overall process.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4137e466">[9]</a> The UML and BPMN methodologies, which share common roots (as they are
                    standardized by the same consortium), appear as good candidates for our

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p20">20</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p20">As a matter of fact, we preferred a methodology of representation derived from
                    the quality of process and we will try to justify our choice further. The
                    quality of process ensures that, for a certain probability or more precisely at
                    a certain error rate, which must be minimized, a process will produce the
                    expected output element. The philosophy of such a representation consists first
                    in observing what already exists and then, upon these observations, in
                    establishing a diagnosis of what must be improved. For this purpose, such
                    methods provide robust ways of building a framework or a model for apprehending
                    reality. With this process representation, we can position ourselves as
                    observers of experienced situations and not as designers of a system, which we
                    cannot pretend to be when scrutinizing the past. In the industry, minimizing an
                    error rate may be characterized as a "progress". It is
                    achieved by adopting a "broad vision of the company" that
                    enables obtaining more control of its activities by a fine analysis. This
                        "business process approach" is of course rooted in our
                    contemporary world and we must maintain a necessary critical distance if we wish
                    to adapt it to our subject. And to do so, we must first state precisely that, in
                    our case, "progress" cannot be related to any
                        "improvement" in terms of quality, for we do not intend
                    to make an audit of the past scholars. We only wish to set in motion a current
                    methodology of quality improvement to visualize past activities. In that
                    perspective, the "broad vision" offered by that methodology
                    meets the expectations of historians using Digital Humanities techniques for it

                    one, etc. To be brief, we can state that, in the SIPOC wording, <cite class="title italic">Supplier</cite> provides inputs to the process, <cite class="title italic">Input</cite> spans materials, resources, and data necessary
                    to execute the process; <cite class="title italic">Process</cite> is a collection of
                    activities that accepts one or more inputs and creates output that is of value
                    to customers; <cite class="title italic">Output</cite> is related to products,
                    services or data resulting from a process whereas <cite class="title italic">Customer</cite> points to internal or external entity that receives

                    period, that is, the Renaissance. Ann Blair’s book is indeed about scholarly
                    information management before the modern age. The author devotes five
                    well-documented chapters on that question. In particular, in chapters 2 and 4,
                    she gives a lot of insights on the note-taking activity regarded as a central
                    step towards information management (chapter 2) and on compiling, which can be
                    viewed as a following step resting on the output collected from the note-takers
                    (chapter 4). These chapters are documented by numerous and detailed examples
                    which give hints on how the different actors could manage the abundance of
                    information. We would like to reread these chapters from the perspective of our

                    in a further work, to build an atlas of processes set up by early modern
                    scholars. Its only virtue will be that of positioning the different activities,
                    as parts of the process, in the global process that leads to a final tool of
                    information management. On this basis, we will examine a case study for which
                    some of the previously detailed phases are consistent with historical

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p35">35</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p35">In chapter 2, the author sets the bases of a history of note-taking, as "various kinds of writing in response to listening,
                            reading, or thinking…for the production of a composition or
                            report"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 64] pointing to the difficulty of such a history due to the loss of material
                    or its immediate destruction inherent in its use. Indeed, as mentioned, "erasable writing surfaces were commonly used for
                            temporary notes"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 65].These surfaces were wax tablets bound in a codex form, pocket-sized
                    writing tablets, slate blackboard, sand tray…In addition to the fragility of
                    those writing surfaces, the discarding of notes, which was common among scholars
                    and especially their heirs, is another feature that makes the taking-note
                    process difficult to analyze [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 66]. Another reason
                    which accounts for the loss of notes is their "physical
                        integration into a manuscript used for printing" as illustrated
                    through Pierre Bayle’s <cite class="title italic">Dictionnaire historique et
                        critique</cite>
                    [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, chap.4]. We can already anticipate that
                        "taking notes", "discarding notes" and "integrating notes"
                    will be categorized as activities in the SIPOC representation whereas the
                    so-called associated means will be represented by all kinds of
                        "erasable surfaces": on one hand wax tables, sand tray,
                    slate blackboard as mentioned above, and on the other hand "loose sheets stored in bundles" and notebooks as stipulated further.
                    What could be the roles corresponding to those activities in the SIPOC
                    flowchart? If we read Ann Blair more thoroughly, we learn that the notes taken
                    by readers on erasable surfaces were often destroyed. Those "first-order" notes, as characterized by the author, served sometimes
                    as a basis to "second-order" notes put on a more
                    durable surface. These could also be put into circulation after revision and
                    authorization by the speaker [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 64–65]. So, the
                    listeners (students, secretaries…) in conjunction with the speakers may be
                    considered "roles" in the "first-order" and/or
                        "second-order" notes production activities. In
                    some cases, the author gives details on how scholars took notes or made
                    annotations when reading a book: sometimes they highlighted passages with
                    keywords in the margins to produce a running index [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 71]. One feature relevant to the process-oriented note-taking
                    activity is the debate between scholars who advocated reading without
                    interruption and those who, in contrast, recommended stopping reading in order
                    to excerpt and to copy passages in a notebook [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 72]. Note-taking most often took one of two forms: either "by
                        epitome or abridgment," that is, by paraphrasing or summarizing the
                    sources, or "by head or commonplaces," that is, by
                    copying passages from the source into a notebook under a commonplace heading.
                    These ways of working shed light on the "note-taking process"
                    that we will link to the "first-order" notes
                    activity.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p36">36</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p36">As the quantity of notes increased, it became of central importance to set up
                    tools for their management. One crucial tool was the assignment of headings to a
                    set of notes. As Blair mentions, the choice of such headings was rarely
                    discussed by scholars, although it was "crucial to effective
                        note-taking" and required judgment, as part of a decision process
                        [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 88]. Another important decision involved the
                    number of headings to be used: to be useful, headings had to be chosen
                    accurately and their number had to be great enough to guarantee sufficient
                    subdivisions, but small enough to prevent the storing of too many notes under
                    the same topic. Another tool for managing notes was their indexation which
                    supposed that each passage of a notebook "would be entered into the index under a keyword"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 91]. One way to do so was to alphabetize the passage "under its principal thing" and to draw up an index on "sheets corresponding to each letter of the alphabet"
                    with references to the notebooks. That way, the index could "receive new headings over time". This indexation of a notebook is
                    therefore described as a living process which, together with the constitution of
                    headings, corresponds to an activity in a SIPOC that could be entitled "notebook management tool elaboration".</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p37">37</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p37">What was the main purpose of excerpting and accumulating notes in notebooks?
                    Blair tackles that question further in chapter 2. The historical materials she
                    presents in her development depict the notes taken by scholars as "an aid to writing", as worded by a subtitle of the
                    chapter. In our view, that "aid to writing" is one
                    branch of the process of writing, and may be considered one of the steps that
                    describe, in the SIPOC, the achievement of a reference book in early modern
                    times.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p38">38</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p38">In chapter 4, more focused on the compiling activity, the author gives many hints
                    on the methods used by compilers and on the social and technical context they
                    were acting in. In particular, she discusses some social and legal elements,
                    which, to our view, should be included in the process description by a SIPOC.
                    For instance, the questions of obtaining privileges, which were only valid
                    within a certain jurisdiction [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 179], or of
                    avoiding censorship [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 204] were determinant in the
                    making of a reference book, although not purely technical. In figure 4, we

                    an application of the SIPOC diagrams presented in the previous section. In the

                    another flow chart, that is, that have a degree of complexity which justifies a

                         [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 210], but also some new techniques based on "the use of

                <div class="counter"><a href="#p44">44</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p44">This foregoing review of Ann Blair’s chapters 2 and 4, translated into a process
                    oriented representation, gave clarifications on the sequences of the activities
                    (at different levels) that yielded a final intellectual product corresponding to
                    the expectations of scholars in early modern Europe. But this generic
                    representation based on SIPOC and flow charts only assigns a correct position to
                    each component in the global process (roles, activities and associated means)
                    provided that the component is effective in the process. If we focus now on a
                    particular case with the intent of building its relevant SIPOC, we should be
                    able to visualize its shift from the generic representation. In particular, we
                    will inevitably have to contend with gaps in historical information, which
                    amounts to the absence of certain components in the SIPOC flowchart. The choice
                    of a particular case could be made in function of different criteria. For
                    instance, we could follow the process of one scholar or a group of scholars who
                    committed themselves to a particular production. That kind of process would
                    spread over a certain geographic area, over a short period of time (that of the
                    scholar’s career). In contrast, we could also take into account the achievement
                    of a book over a long period of time, such as Theodor Zwinger’s <cite class="title italic">Theatrum Humanae Vitae</cite>, which, as related in chapter
                    2, spanned over almost one century and a half, or the <cite class="title italic">Polyanthea</cite> produced during 178 years.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p45">45</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p45">For the sake of "simplicity" (if the term is relevant for such
                    a study), we propose to focus on the Jesuit Francesco Sacchini as a note-taker.
                    Sacchini’s way of taking notes contrasted with that of others as he recommended "the interruption in reading that resulted from stopping
                            to copy a passage into one’s notebook: it slowed down reading and aided
                            retention"
                         [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 72]. In more detail, we learn that Sacchini recommended taking notes in two
                    steps: first he selected passages and wrote them out on a notebook "in the order in which they were encountered", and
                    second he copied the passages out in another notebook under commonplace headings
                        [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 77]. If we read Blair’s account correctly,
                    we assume that Sacchini read a passage once and wrote it twice as just
                        mentioned.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4137e1020">[17]</a> The selection process was materially performed by
                    underlining the passage of interest in a book [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 86]. Then, as we pointed out in the previous section, the choice of a heading was
                    also an important step in the process. Concerning Sacchini’s method of heading
                    choice, Blair alludes to it [<a class="ref" href="#blair2010">Blair 2010</a>, 89], but it is
                    likely that we do not have sufficient materials to give a thorough development.
                    It is anyway worth mentioning and positioning it in the flow chart, even if we
                    are not able to provide a focus on it. It is likely that the choice of a heading
                    was made when copying the passage out for the second time, enhanced by
                    familiarity with the text acquired during the first round of note-taking. That
                    iterative process is described by figure 6. </div>

                    diagram coupled with flow charts at different levels, proved to be a powerful
                    candidate to visualize and represent data at the front-end of a digital system
                    where historical work must be stored. Beyond its advantages in terms of
                    visualization, it compels an accurate and rigorous analysis of activities, and
                    in so doing, it enables setting up a powerful focus on specific cases.
                    Therefore, it provides the scholars with a tool reference for comparing
                    different cases and for raising subsequent questions. In addition, that tool
                    does not concentrate only on individuals, but it defines, in a broad meaning,
                    activities and roles related to each other, which gives an account of the
                    interactions between the actors and their environment. Last, one more advantage
                    of such a methodology lies in its ability to provide a global and overall
                    representation of a past enterprise.</div>
                <div class="counter"><a href="#p47">47</a></div><div class="ptext" id="p47">However, we must be careful when using this methodology. Indeed, the first
                    problem we encounter when we try to apply the SIPOC and flow chart
                    representation is related to the effort we must make to deeply understand all
                    its subtleties. Indeed, this methodology was not first designed for historical
                    works: it is then necessary to adjust it to the needs of historians (for
                    instance, by redefining some of the vocabulary). Furthermore, it rapidly proves
                    to be inoperative if the amount of scholarship evidence is not sufficient, as it
                    is demanding many details to be enlightening.</div>

                    scholarly work, namely any work related to the production of knowledge. But, we
                    can now legitimately examine whether that method of visualization could be
                    applied to other works. To answer this problem, we favored a pragmatic approach:
                    as our point is not to build a theoretical framework within which we would
                    demonstrate logically the validity and the relevancy of our method for a general
                    case, but rather to show that it can help visualize results of selected
                    scholarly works in a thorough way. To that end, we put our attention on a recent
                    publication, "Copy and Counterfeit in the
                        Renaissance"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#duclos-mounier2014">Duclos-Mounier and Nativel 2014</a>], which collects the proceedings of an
                    international conference dedicated to this topic. It is a 500-page volume
                    divided into two main parts: the first one is theoretical and deals with art,
                    book, or science and religion history; the second one, more practical,
                    investigates different cases of literature, book, art, science, religion or
                    economy counterfeit. One of these case studies describes and analyses "textile copy and counterfeit in the Renaissance"
                    [<a class="ref" href="#jeggle2014">Jeggle 2014</a>]. In this chapter, the author makes the distinction
                    between imitation and copy or counterfeit. In certain cases, imitation consists
                    of the substitution of raw materials used to make the textile. For example, the
                    origin and the quality of the fiber used to make the textile were of first
                    importance: making products with wool from another origin than expected (maybe
                    cheaper) was a constant temptation, but these products were usually considered
                    falsified. Another example: were the silk threads made with first choice silk or
                    with scrap material? In Italy, the regulations demanded that thread be spun with
                    pure materials, which implied thorough controls. The next step in textile
                    fabrication was the weaving phase. It was then possible to circumvent the
                    quality standards by introducing threads of different quality levels or by using
                    less thread than recommended. We learn from the chapter that it was a source of
                    numerous conflicts within the production centers. After the weaving, many
                    textiles were bleached or dyed. The quality of the dying was also a matter of
                    discussion: some colors could be made with different materials. Their durability
                    and the damages caused by the subsequent chemical reactions were variable and
                    influenced the quality of the final result. Last, high quality textiles needed
                    fine finishes of which the quality determined also that of the product. During
                    these last phases, there were numerous opportunities for counterfeiting: quality
                    of the textile and quality of the fabrication procedures were the main
                    parameters to play with for copying original products. To prevent these
                    practices, the authorities had organized committees that examined the fabric
                    quality. They had set up production standards and inspection organizations that
                    certified the products and, when necessary, they declared fraud perpetrations.
                    For instance, in Augsburg, woolen sheets were inspected at several times during
                    their production: these inspections mainly involved the material quality of the
                    fabric and also the quality of its treatment. Surely, the practices of
                    inspection and certification were different according to the areas and the
                    production places. The inspection and its subsequent certification were
                    materialized by seals printed on the fabrics with ink, wax or lead. The wax
                    color indicated the quality level. </div>

                    focused on linen production in Westphalia. As our purpose is not to summarize

                    milestones corresponding to the different inspections and certifications that we
                    briefly presented above. This flowchart rests on the principle that a process
                    which would successfully pass all these phases would produce certified and not
                    counterfeited fabric. All these activities are represented as general ones,
                    which means that they may be unfolded into subactivities to provide more
                    details. This could be achieved, for example, by extracting the information
                    contained in the footnotes of the chapter. Note that the bypass arrow between
                    the "Dying quality control" and the "Quality control" milestones
                    models a "normal" fabric, namely a fabric that has not been
                    finely finished. On the right side, we attached to each activity its inputs,
                    outputs and its associated means (in a parchment symbol). Note that the question
                    mark we appended to the associated means state that the author of the chapter
                    did not clearly mention them. However, when we figure out in terms of process
                    the situation that he describes, the question of the means implemented by the
                    textile workers must be raised at the precise place pointed by the flowchart.
                    This is another virtue of such a representation: the gain of an overall view

                    common methods to build databases according to standard models. As previously
                    mentioned, an information system, that is to say the core of any Digital
                    Humanities project, usually rests on three main components (see <a href="#figure04">figure 3</a>). First, the data model, mainly a
                    database, contains the scholarship work organized according to a rationale.
                    Then, the view acts as an interactive component between the data model and the
                    end-user. It is a simple web page, a rich interface application (or RIA based on
                    JavaScript framework) or a traditional graphical user interface (java based for
                    example), depending on the level of sophistication. Last, the controller is the
                    component that connects to the database, retrieves the data relevant to the user
                    query and prepares them for a display on the view. The main advantage of such
                    architecture lies in its ability to distribute the overall development among
                    different specialized skills (database design, programming and view web-based
                    design). We have already presented the process map methodology as the view
                    component relevant to certain historical works. Let us now briefly describe what
                    could be another central brick in Digital Humanities: the organization of
                    historical evidence or the design of specific databases. In human sciences, the
                    databases must essentially follow the relational model based on the second

                    historians any longer. At least, they offer new visions on the historian works,
                    new ways of analyzing and new ways of researching [<a class="ref" href="#cohen2006">Cohen and Rosenweig 2006</a>]. If
                    we focus on our SIPOC approach, we can notice that the foregoing <span class="hi italic">flowcharts</span> are good candidates for segmentation in atomic
                    entities as recommended by the relational second and third normal forms. Indeed,
                    we can anticipate, in the case of a database design, that activities would be
                    modeled by an entity which would cover several attributes such as its title, a
                    description and probably other useful fields. That entity would have a
                    relationship with others: a "role" entity, an "input" entity, an
                    output entity and a document entity. These relationships would be attributed
                    cardinalities whose values would depend on their nature. As it is obvious that a
                    role may be linked to several activities and, reciprocally, an activity may be
                    performed by several roles, the relationship activity-role will be of type
                        "n-m" with a "0-N" cardinality on each side.<a class="noteRef" href="#d4137e1156">[20]</a> Concerning the input, output and document entities, we
                    can consider, for the sake of simplicity, 1-n relationships with the activity
                    entity, which means that an activity is related to, at most, one input
                    (respectively output or document) and that the input activity may be linked to
                    another activity. As a consequence of such a choice, the field that describes
                    the input (respectively output or document) must be multivalued in order to
                    account for the fact that, in reality, several inputs may correspond to one

                    assigning a "sequence" entity to the "Role-Activity" relationship. In addition, as seen previously, an
                    activity may be expanded in "subactivities", which amounts to create a

                    reasons, the number of branches to 3. The modeling of such a feature may be a
                    reflexive relationship on the activity entity itself. Therefore, a more definite

                    best practices in order to account for scholarship evidence of professional
                    historical works. The best practices we are pointing at come either from the
                    industrial management process, from the software development and from the
                    critical distance that we must take to produce a relevant visualization of a
                    scholarly work. Concerning this latter point, we carried out tests of our
                    solution on two different topics that were objects of investigations by
                    historians, namely the production of knowledge and the question of
                    counterfeiting in the Renaissance. We saw that the SIPOC-<span class="hi italic">flowchart</span> representation gives an overall view of a case study that
                    resulted from a scholarly work. It gives an insight to the shape and structure
                    that constrain the practices of a community. But we also argued that building a
                        SIPOC-<span class="hi italic">flowchart</span> helped us raise problems and
                    questions that we did not anticipate before, in the sense that our
                    representation suggests (through the blanks that it left) solving and answering
                    particular problems.</div>

                    our solution. Indeed and in a practical way, once we have properly designed a
                    database to represent data coming from historical works, we open the door to the
                    web ecosystem and to all the features it offers. In particular, we can imagine,

                        the entity is involved in the relationship at least zero times and at most
                        several times.</div><div class="endnote" id="d4137e1159"><span class="noteRef">[21]</span> So, the description field of an input element would
                        correspond to several inputs. For instance, "input1" will be described
                        by "first order notes, books, letters". This is technically simpler
                        than considering three elements "input1" (first order notes),
                            "input2" (books), "input3" (letters) that we should link to
                        the same activity through an "n-m" relationship. It induces more
                        redundancy but offers more simplicity.</div><div class="endnote" id="d4137e1225"><span class="noteRef">[22]</span>
