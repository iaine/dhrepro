A Welcome from the Stanford University Librarian
Michael Keller
Stanford University

Digital Humanists meeting at Stanford this month, whether present virtually or physically, are most welcome to our
campus. Your host organization this year is Stanford University Libraries and Academic Information Resources,
a long name for a complex and unique organization in higher education. SULAIR is a library, a cybrary, an
academic computing organization, a publisher of scholarly monographs (Stanford University Press), and a provider
of publishing services to about 140 scholarly journal publishers (HighWire Press), each specialty division supporting
and informing the others in this mélange.
We have supported digital humanities research and teaching numerous ways over the years through our digitization
services, our academic technology specialist agents, our humanities curators, our digital archiving programs
(LOCKSS and the Stanford Digital Repository), and our e-publishing services. We have found collaborators and
fellow travelers along this route from the British Library, the Matthew Parker Library of Corpus Christi College of the
University of Cambridge, the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, University of Virginia,
University of Michigan, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the University of Alicante, among others.
A fluff piece in American Libraries last year described SULAIR as a “juggernaut of innovation.” Perhaps we are,
but our collective nose has been on the grindstone employing Blacklight to provide a richer OPAC, including virtual
browsing of our classified collections and partnering with Google not just in the library digitization program, but as
well in prototyping an innovative e-Thesis service integrating academic decisions on dissertations, easy workflows
leading digital dissertations to our digital archive (the Stanford Digital Repository) and ultimately to Google for free
indexing and access on a global basis. Matt Jockers and others in the SEASR team will report on the NLP research
underway here and with several collaborating institutions. This recital could go on and on.
We here use i.t. for prosaic purposes, getting unusual returns on investments in clever uses of technology in support
of the usual library/cybrary functions. We use i.t. for innovative purposes, often resulting in open source tools and
environments (Hydra and LOCKSS, for example). And we promote and support the use of i.t. in research and
teaching (digital maps & GIS in numerous projects, and CourseWork, the local Sakai implementation, for example).
You are all most welcome here. Glen Worthey, chief of our 25-year-old Humanities Digital Information Service,
and Matt Jockers, Academic Technology Specialist and leader of the SEASR project, are responsible for local
arrangements for this meeting. We are excited as they are to have you here and look forward to learning from all
of you.

Welcome to the Big Tent

Welcome to Stanford, and welcome to Digital Humanities 2011. Our very public goal over the past two years (and
more) of preparation for this week has been to bring this, our favorite DH conference, to Stanford. But we also
confess to another, more private goal: to bring Stanford to the DH conference. We've long recognized the digital
humanities practices, and even a very particular digital humanities spirit, in the work of many, many of our Stanford
colleagues; we've long suspected that they would find a welcome place in the community represented by ADHO and
the annual DH conferences — even though, until recently, only a handful of us have been regular DH attendees.
Every institution has its quirks, its culture and its subcultures, and one aspect of Stanford academic life that
we've grown accustomed to here is what we've come to call the "entrepreneurial," by which of course we mean
enterprising, risk-taking, and adventuresome. (Of course, it's also a nod to Stanford history and geography, and
to the many generations of Stanford's Silicon Valley brainchildren, from pre-Hewlett-Packard to post-Google.) But
"entrepreneurial" means not only that: Stanford's digital humanists have not until recently been much engaged
in the formation of DH centers or departments, nor have they coalesced around a single professional society or
journal or annual conference. Instead, our work and our practitioners have been distributed across many academic
departments, in the Libraries, and various research initiatives, with pockets of intense and important DH activity in
all those places.
The theme we've chosen for DH2011 is "Big Tent Digital Humanities," and this was meant, in part, to convey our own
desire to include in the DH2011 the many different varieties of DH practice that surround us right here at Stanford.
At the same time, the "big tent" seemed to us an appropriate metaphorical response to some of the debates that
have flourished in the digital humanities worldwide, especially in the past few years, about the meanings and limits
of the Digital Humanities designation. Although DH2011 belongs to everyone who participates in it, by choosing this
theme we meant to announce publicly our own opinion that a broad and diverse and vibrant DH field, one in which
a thousand flowers might bloom, is the sort of DH we at Stanford believe in and hope to promote.
(And speaking of a thousand flowers: the psychedelic flower-child theme of our conference website, our logo, and
the design of the book of abstracts you're reading now, were all created by our many-talented Stanford DH colleague
Nicole Coleman. We hope it conveys to you not only our heritage of California dreaming, but also — and more
importantly — our sense of wonder and appreciation for the many-splendored field of DH, for its practice of creative
exuberance, for its opening of the scholarly mind and senses to new and revolutionary ways of seeing and thinking
about the humanities. We believe you'll find that the DH revolution we hope to promote is of a peace-loving, sunshiny
nature — but no less revolutionary for all that.)
A proper list of acknowledgments would run to many, many pages, but let us mention a particular few without
whose help both we and DH2011 would be utterly lost: the ADHO Conference Coordinating Committee chair, John
Unsworth, has helped us through every stage of the planning process, from well before the submission of our bid
to host DH2011 more than two years ago, to.... Well, I imagine we'll have still more questions for John and other
ADHO executives long after everyone else has gone home. ADHO's International Program Committee, chaired with
diligence and a gentle hand by Kay Walter, has assembled a wonderful bouquet of papers, panels, posters, and
workshops from a select portion of the many hundreds of DH flowers that bloomed in the submission process; of
course, Kay and her team also had the thankless task of having to turn away many worthy proposals. To all those

VI

Digital Humanities 2011

who submitted, we express our sincere thanks; to those many whose proposals did not end up in the final program,
we also say: We know how you feel; we've been there too. Even the biggest tents have sell-out crowds.
Closer to home, a small army of people have helped make this conference possible, foremost among them our
meeting planner Melanie Walton, with the help of a great team in Stanford Conference Services. Melanie and
company have expertly handled more details of more aspects of pulling off a conference like this than the two of us
even knew existed, and they've done so with patience and good humor. Our team of conference volunteers is made
up of good-humored graduate students from the Stanford Literary Lab, under the direction of Franco Moretti and Matt
(one of yours truly), as well as a number of colleagues from the Stanford University Libraries. These people have
helped with everything from text markup to staffing the registration tables, but they're really far too accomplished
to be doing this sort of thing; ask them about their real work as they're showing you around campus or helping
you with WiFi.
Of course, a lot more could be said about Stanford, about DH in general, and about DH2011 in particular (not to
mention at least a dozen more clichés of 1960s counterculture, and a dozen different ways of parsing our "big tent"
metaphor) — but let's get on with the show.
Matt Jockers & Glen Worthey, your local hosts

Katherine L. Walter

This year is a very special one as the Digital Humanities 2011 conference returns to California with the new theme
“Big Tent Digital Humanities.” The DH2011 conference has more papers and a wider range of topics than many in
the past. In large part, this is thanks to all of you who took the theme to heart and participated by submitting abstracts
for panels, papers and posters. In hopes of addressing the issue of a growing conference, the program committee
called for both long and short papers, with longer ones addressing newly concluded research or theory, and short
papers reporting on research in progress. It is through the short papers that we were able to expand the conference.
The Program Committee encourages you to explore new topics outside your comfort zone. Our field is broad and
the conference reflects this. Where better to learn new things?
As mentioned, the Digital Humanities conference is growing, and the number of papers proposed far exceeded the
number of time slots available. In response to this, the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, its member
associations, and the Conference Coordinating Committee are considering new approaches to the conference.
Among ideas raised have been expanding the number of concurrent sessions, extending the conference by one
day, and extending the length of the day. Your thoughts on this issue are appreciated and can be submitted to the
Conference Coordinating Committee.
In recognition of our Big DH Tent, our keynote addresses are by David Rumsey, creator of the well-known eponymous
map collection and president of Cartography Associates; and J.B. Michel and Erez Lieberman-Aiden of Harvard
University, who will be speaking about their large-scale “culturomics” research conducted in association with the
Google Books project. Thus the conference begins with the public (and geospatial) humanities, and concludes with
corpus research on previously unimaginable scales.
I would like to thank the members of the international program committee who have contributed so much of their
time. The members of the committee are: Arianna Ciula (ALLC) Dominic Forest (SDH-SEMI) Cara Leitch (SDHSEMI) John Nerbonne (ALLC) Bethany Nowviskie (ACH) Daniel O’Donnell (SDH-SEMI) Dorothy (Dot) Porter (ACH)
Jan Rybicki (ALLC) John Walsh (ACH)
Local organizers Glen Worthey and Matt Jockers have been great contributors to our efforts.
Finally, I would like to thank all of you who agreed to review abstracts; you are acknowledged individually in the
pages of this book. Your time is appreciated, and together, I believe we have planned an exceptional conference.

Charles Douglas Bush, 1948 - 2011
The digital humanities community lost a good friend and colleague with the death of Chuck Bush, long-time Treasurer
of the Association for Computers and Humanities and an unfailingly warm presence at the annual digital humanities
conference which he attended with his wife, Junola. Chuck was trained as a linguist and worked at Brigham
Young University as a Senior Research Consultant in the Humanities Technology and Research Support Center,
where he often explored his interests in both print and electronic publishing. He was one of the early advocates
for Humanities Computing education, as he both administered and taught in the Computers and the Humanities
Program. Humanities faculty at BYU will remember Chuck for his kind and dedicated assistance with arcane
computer issues, as well as for his enthusiasm and unfailingly pleasant manner.
Chuck served for more than 20 years on the ACH Executive Council, and for those of us who worked closely with him
during that time he was a constant source of calm good sense, humor, and organizational memory. An absolutely
trustworthy steward for the ACH during its slowly rising fortunes, Chuck played a crucial role in managing the ACH's
alliance with ADHO in 2005-6 and in helping the organization through a challenging transitional time. He could be
counted on to suggest a helpful compromise, clarify a tricky point, or bring a discussion down to earth-he was never
rattled or partisan.
Chuck was not given to self-display, but he had a great and subtle wit even in routine email. He was principled
without imposing on others. With his particular dedication to supporting younger scholars and education, he was a
strong champion of the ACH and ADHO bursary programs, and as ACH Treasurer he had the pleasure each year
of handing out checks in a worthy cause. Those of us who met him annually for meetings and a conference will
remember him with great affection, taking off his glasses in a meditative way before offering his thoughts. He will
be much missed and warmly remembered by all.
Prepared by Julia Flanders with contributions from the DH community.

Re-Imagining Scholarship in the Digital Age
Gaffield, Chad

1. Abstract
Quite unexpectedly and often in surprising ways, Digital Humanities have been playing a central role in the larger reimagining of scholarship in the early 21st century. This re-imagining is transforming teaching, research and, indeed,
all aspects of academic life. Moreover, the established boundaries between, and relationships among, scholarly
activities on campus and in the larger society are falling flat or being re-configured through networks, clusters and
dynamic forms of engagement. The result is exhilarating and un-nerving, inspiring and challenging, energizing and
exhausting, if judged by public debate on campus and beyond about the changing post-secondary landscape. But if
we focus on the emergence and current trajectory of Digital Humanities, we can perceive with cautious optimism the
ways in which a re-imagined scholarship is beginning to enhance learning, to help interpret the past and present,
and to contribute to meaningful life in the 21st century.

2. Bio
Gaffield is Professor of History at the University of Ottawa and currently on leave while he serves as President of
the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Founding Director of the Institute of Canadian
Studies, Gaffield has been since the 1970s at the forefront of computer-based analyses of long-term social change.
He has played a leading role in, and produced award-winning publications from, database projects such as the
Canadian Social History Project, the Vancouver Island Project, the Lower Manhattan Project, and the Canadian
Families Project; as President of the Humanities and Social Sciences Federation of Canada, he also championed
the Data Liberation Initiative.
Among his many notable accomplishments, the prize is awarded to Gaffield for his role as Principal Investigator for
the Canadian Century Research Infrastructure project (CCRI; www.ccri.uottawa.ca). CCRI has created a foundation
for the study of social, economic, cultural, and political change at a national level, beginning with digital reconstruction
of censuses that sit at the core of a pan-national research database consisting of pertinent contextual data drawn
from newspapers, parliamentary proceedings, legislative records and beyond.

Culturomics: Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized
Books
Lieberman-Aiden, Erez
Michel, Jean-Baptiste

1. Abstract
We constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing about 4% of all books ever printed. Analysis of this corpus
enables us to investigate cultural trends quantitatively. We survey the vast terrain of ‘culturomics,’ focusing on
linguistic and cultural phenomena that were reflected in the English language between 1800 and 2000. We show
how this approach can provide insights about fields as diverse as lexicography, the evolution of grammar, collective
memory, the adoption of technology, the pursuit of fame, censorship, and historical epidemiology. Culturomics
extends the boundaries of rigorous quantitative inquiry to a wide array of new phenomena spanning the social
sciences and the humanities.

2. Bios

Reading Historical Maps Digitally: How Spatial Technologies Can
Enable Close, Distant and Dynamic Interpretations
Rumsey, David

1. Abstract
Maps are dense, complex information systems arranged spatially. While they share similarities with other visual
artifacts, their uniqueness as spatially arranged visual information both allows for and demands special digital
approaches to understand and reuse their content. Georeferencing, vectorization, virtual reality, image databases,
and GIS-related tools all work to unite our eyes, minds, and computers in new ways that can make historical maps
more valuable and accessible to humanists concerned with place and space over time. Rumsey will explore the
tools and techniques that have implications for the ways digital humanists approach visual information.

2. Bio
David Rumsey is a renowned collector of historical maps, a digital librarian, an online publisher, builder, and
philanthropist. His collection of more than 150,000 maps is one of the largest private map collections in the United
States, and he recently announced his intention to donate it to the Stanford University Libraries. With his growing
online collection of more than 26,000 maps, available to all in high resolution and with expert cataloging, Rumsey
is one of the most visible and important modern distributors of historical treasures for the common good, a pioneer
Internet philanthropist, and a public Internet intellectual. Visit the David Rumsey Map Collection online at http://
www.davidrumsey.com/. With his bold experiments in the use of GIS with historical maps, his innovative use of
virtual worlds for purveyance of serious scholarly materials, and his outspoken and concrete actions toward the
building of a real public digital library, David Rumsey is a rare and exemplary figure of antiquarian in the digital world,
and entrepreneur in the academy.

This workshop will present, demonstrate, and provide
participants with the opportunity to test and discuss
prototypes of several experimental visualization tools
for literary studies. The tools will provide a range
of approaches to visualizing the Orlando Project’s
textbase. Some but not all will allow for input of other
data. Although the workshop is focused on literary
studies in English, we welcome participants from
other related disciplines such as history, philosophy,
the history of science, media studies, or library and
information science, as well as those with an interest
in text visualization generally, and those interested in
corpuses in languages other than English.
The Orlando Project’s fifteen-year experiment in
literary history explores the potential of computers
to support new modes of humanities research,
particularly the potential of digital technologies to
enable interpretive and critical scholarship. The major
result of that endeavour, the online Orlando: Women’s
Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the
Present (Brown et al 2006; orlando.cambridge.org),
constitutes the single most extensive and detailed
resource in the area, hailed by the Modern Language
Association’s Guide to Literary Research as “a model
for similar databases that will supplant printed literary
dictionaries, encyclopedias, and handbooks” (Harner).
Though Orlando resembles a reference work, its
electronic structure embeds an entire critical and
theoretical framework to support advanced literary
historical enquiry. The workshop proposed here will

present and allow participants to experiment with
prototypes based on emergent methods in text
mining and visualization that leverage that embedded
structure to enable new discovery paths in literary
history.
The Orlando textbase—about 80 print volumes’ worth
of born-digital scholarship encoded with an XML
tagset of more than 250 tags covering the production,
characteristics, and reception of texts)—constitutes a
rare testbed for investigating the mining of structured
text. Its online interface and search system were
developed according to W3C standards to exploit
the underlying markup, and designed to meet the
expectation of text-oriented users of conventional
online tools. This existing interface is very searchoriented and entirely textual in its delivery of results.
Current research in humanities computing and humancomputer interaction is increasingly expanding beyond
the text-oriented information retrieval paradigm, to
explore instead the many opportunities offered by
new, more flexible, more visually-oriented platforms
for web delivery (e.g. Ahlberg and Shneiderman 1994;
Bederson 2000, 2001; Harris 2006, 2007; Greengrass
and Hughes, 2008). In this period of transformation, the
scholarly interface requires not only experimentation
but also careful assessment to see what works to make
digital materials of real value to humanities scholars.
As argued by Ramsay (2003), Unsworth (2006), and
others, using computers to do literary research can
contribute to hermeneutic or interpretive inquiry. Digital
humanities research has inherited from computational
science a leaning towards systematic knowledge
representation. This has proved serviceable in some
humanities activities, such as editing, but digital
methods have far more to offer the humanities than
this. As Drucker and Nowviskie have argued, “The
computational processes that serve speculative inquiry
must be dynamic and constitutive in their operation, not
merely procedural and mechanistic” (431).
Our goal for this workshop is to provide those
interested in literary studies and the digital humanities
with an introduction to some of the tools being
developed to support interactive speculative inquiry
through text mining and visualization. In the process,
we hope to garner insight into users’ reactions to
these tools to inform further design and development
activities. The prototypes presented at this workshop
are being developed as possible interfaces to
complement Orlando’s current, more conventional
one.
The prototypes presented at the workshop will include
the following:

Digital Humanities 2011

- Mandala Browser: this browser allows users to
create “magnets” based on free text or XML search
that attract to them items in a text collection, and
to visualize the relationships between different sets.
It can be used with the Orlando data or with other
textual datasets. (Sinclair and Ruecker)
- Orlando Degrees of Separation tool: this tool shows
the connections between individuals in the Orlando
data by way of other people, places, organizations,
or titles. The challenge is in organizing the
visualization of the paths when there are multiple
ones, as there frequently are in this highly interlinked
set of data
- OrlandoVision, a network graph visualization tool:
creates a social network graph in which individuals’
names are nodes and links between them are edges,
which are color-coded according to the semantic
context of the link as represented in the markup
- Breadboard interface for tracing links between
individuals and entities: a more textually-oriented
interface for browsing links between individuals and
entities within the Orlando data
- Voyeur: a general-purpose web-based text analysis
environment designed for large-scale corpora;
includes experimental visualization modules for
exploring word trends, named entities, and other
textual features
- this tools shows the connections between individuals
in the Orlando data by way of other people,
places, organizations, or titles. The challenge is in
organizing the visualization of the paths when there
are multiple ones, as there frequently are in this
highly interlinked set of data
- possibly other visualization tools emergent from
current research: we are experimenting with other
mining and visualization tools between now and
DH2011 and may pull ones that seem to have
potential into the workshop program
This workshop emerges from ongoing research on
visualization for literary research, and participants
will be asked, but not required, to participate in the
study through surveys, interviews, and recording of
user sessions in accordance with the ethics protocols
approved by our respective universities.

1. Abstract

Bio: Dr James Cummings helps to manage a team
of developers in the Oxford University Computing
Services working on digital humanities projects. He is
a member of the TEI@Oxford group providing training
and support for TEI projects and has served on the
TEI Technical Council since 2004. He is the elected
director of the Digital Medievalist project.

ODD (One Document Does it all) is the XML
vocabulary which the Text Encoding Initiative has
developed to describe itself, and which users of the TEI
employ to customize the TEI and create documentation
and schemas appropriate to their varied needs. It
can be used to document and describe any XML
vocabulary. Attendees are expected to have some
basic knowledge of XML and the TEI.
Introductory TEI ODD is a three-hour tutorial taught
by the TEI@Oxford team (James Cummings and
Sebastian Rahtz) on using TEI ODD for documenting
and constraining your project's TEI XML. This
beginners-level course provides a hands-on practical
introduction to the basic ideas of the TEI ODD system,
exploring the process of designing a TEI profile from
the user perspective, and using the TEI's Roma web
application to model a schema. We will explore the
full capabilities of Roma, from designing and testing a
basic XML schema with a few clicks, up to the design of
a highly customized and multilingual application profile.
Participants will be taught using Roma and the oXygen
XML editor. They will define a detailed customization
of the TEI, generate schemas and documentation, and
have an understanding of the TEI ODD language. This
tutorial will equip participants with the necessary skills
to customize the TEI for their project's specific needs.

most likely to be able to take away and use (such as,
parts of speech, NER, and parsing).
- Introduction, digital text corpora, markup, metadata,
and search. Issues of spelling, tokenization and
morphology (30 mins)
- Counting words, counting n-grams, collocations (20
mins)

Large and ever-increasing amounts of text are now
available digitally from many sources. Beyond raw
text, there are also increasing troves of text annotated
with various kinds of metadata and analysis. This
data provides new opportunities in the humanities
to do different kinds of analyses and at different
scales, some of which blur the boundaries between
the traditional analytical and critical methods of
the humanities versus empirical and quantitative
approaches common in the social sciences. Since
texts are central to the humanities, a key opportunity
is in “text mining” – making use of computers for
analyzing texts, and it is here that there is much
opportunity for the use of tools from Natural Language
Processing. The last two decades have also seen the
field of Natural Language Processing refocused on
being able to process and analyze the huge amounts of
available digital speech and text, partly through the use
of new probabilistic and machine learning methods.
This has led to the development of many robust
methods and tools for text processing, many of which
are within reach of the ambitious practitioner, and often
are available for free as open source software.
This tutorial will survey what you can do with
digital texts, starting from word counts and working
up through deeper forms of analysis including
collocations, named entities, parts of speech,
constituency and dependency parses, detecting
relations, events, and semantic roles, coreference
resolution, and clustering and classification for various
purposes, including theme, genre and sentiment
analysis. It will provide a high-level not-too-technical
presentation of what these tools do and how, and
provide concrete information on what kinds of tools
are available, how they are used, what options are
available, examples of their use, and some idea of
their reliability, limitations, and whether they can be
customized. The emphasis will be at the level of
what techniques exist and what you can and can’t
do with them. The hope is to empower participants
in envisioning how these tools might be employed in
humanities research.

nor to keep it up to date by following releases. It is
fairly user friendly and easily accessible and therefore
enables experimentation with different techniques
popular among linguists from various fields, especially
dialectology and variationist linguistics.
During the workshop we will give some theoretical
background about dialectometry followed by a
tutorial where the theory is put into practice
with exercises showing how to use the webapplication. We have given similar courses in
dialectology previously, for example during the
Linguistic Society of America Linguistics Institute
in 2005 at MIT and to the special meeting of
the Forum Sprachvariation of the Internationale
Gesellschaft füt deutsche Dialektologie in Erlangen in
Oct. 2010 (www.sprachwissenschaft.uni-erlangen.de/
tagung/programm.shtml). The workshop proposed
here will be like the second in that it will include handson sessions.
The workshop will be structured as follows:
1. Introduction to dialectometry
2. Data entry: uploading dialect data, creating and
uploading maps
3. Data inspection: data distribution and error detection
4. Measuring linguistic distances

We frequently ask in linguistics, especially in
dialectology and comparative linguistics, how similar
linguistic varieties are to one another, effectively asking
how similar linguistic culture is from one site to another.
We operationalize the question more specifically by
asking e.g. how similar the vocabulary of one variety
is to another, or more interestingly how similar the
pronunciations of a set of varieties are, sampled via
the pronunciations of the same set of at least 30 words
at a range of sites. Since there may be thousands of
words and hundreds of sites, the questions must be
addressed computationally. The techniques embodied
in the web application have been used in dozens of
scholarly papers on dialectology (see references).
At the University of Groningen the gabmap application
has been developed that is capable of measuring
differences in linguistic samples, including in particular
sets of phonetic (or phonemic) transcriptions, to project
present the results graphically onto maps. Gabmap
is a graphical user interface that implements not only
the comparison of vocabulary or other categorical
data (essentially as percentage overlap or percentage
difference) but also that of pronunciations via edit
distance. Because the software is implemented as a
web application users are not required to download it

5. Graphical presentations of linguistic distances:
dialect maps
6. Statistical analyses: multidimensional scaling and
clustering
7. Data mining, identifying influential individual
variables (words, pronunciation variants)
We have named the gabmap collaborators as coauthors of the tutorial, but only Nerbonne and
maximally one other will offer the tutorial. We can
accommodate up to 20 participants.
We add a note to potential participants from nonlinguistic fields. In theory one might ask the same
questions of non-linguistic culture that we ask of
linguistic culture, namely to what degree is e.g. the
material culture of one settlement similar to that of
another. We suspect that one might attack the nonlinguistic question using techniques similar to the ones
we will demonstrate during this tutorial, i.e. one might
gather question as, but the point is purely theoretical
so far, although we would welcome the chance to
examine the question in a data-intensive way. If such
studies are carried out, we suspect that at least the
mapping facilities we demonstrate in this tutorial will be
useful.

1. Description
Are you interested in using computing methods
to analyze electronic texts? Geoffrey Rockwell
(University of Alberta) and Stéfan Sinclair (McMaster
University) will run a hands-on workshop on using the
web-based Voyeur Tools text analysis environment
(voyeurtools.org). Participants can follow along with
example documents or use their own. Voyeur Tools is
the latest text analysis web-based system developed
by TAPoR collaborators and it brings together
visualization and concording tools in a fashion that
allows multipanel interactive analysis or single tool
analysis. Voyeur Tools runs on a high performance
computing cluster and is capable of scaling to handle
multiple documents and larger texts than previous web
based tools.
The workshop will provide:
- An introduction to basic text analysis concepts and
techniques (independent of the tool set being used)
- An introduction to different ways of using Voyeur
Tools. Voyeur can be used in a multi-panel view
where the different tools interact or as individual
tools. Users will be shown different ways of running
Voyeur Tools and how to manage panels.
- Understanding the Voyeur display. Voyeur provides
a number of different panels with information from
a summary of the corpus to distribution graphs.
Participants will be taken through the different panels
and the capabilities of each one.
- Using Voyeur Recipes for analysis. Participants will
be introduced to the Voyeur Recipes, which are
tutorials on how to use Voyeur for research tasks.
We will start by looking at how Voyeur can be used
to explore a theme through a text. We will then look
at using Voyeur for diachronic study of a collection
of documents over time.

Digital Humanities 2011

- Quoting Voyeur results. Users will be introduced to
Voyeur's ability to produce HTML fragments that can
be used to quote results in other online documents.
With Voyeur you can export your results in various
ways, one of which is placing live panels into blogs
or wikis.
- Integrating Voyeur into remote sites. We have
developed specialized plugins that integrate with
frameworks such as WordPress, Drupal and OJS.
Participants will learn about these as well as how to
integrate Voyeur into almost any site with a generic
plugin module.

An Introduction to XForms for
Digital Humanists: How XForms
Can Help Your Project
Sperberg-McQueen, Michael

cmsmcq@acm.org
Black Mesa Technologies LLC, United States of
America

This tutorial will introduce participants to XForms,
viewed as a technology for building customized editors
for XML documents.
Originally developed as a replacement for conventional
HTML forms, XForms is designed to work well in the
Web browser, allowing forms to be specified using
the familiar facilities of XHTML and CSS. XForms is
based on the model/view/controller architecture, and
because the model being operated upon consists of a
set of XML documents, XForms provides a convenient
basis for developing custom tools for working with
XML documents. With XForms, it becomes feasible
for projects to develop vocabulary- and task-specific
editors for use within the project. For suitably chosen
tasks, specialized tools of this kind can require less
training and provide better task support than full XML
editors; it is thus easier to allow domain experts to
examine and modify XML encoding, and routine tasks
can be performed more quickly and reliably.
Any project making systematic use of XML will involve
a number of tasks requiring systematic changes
to XML documents, which may be more easily
handled using XForms than with other techniques. For
example:
- The samples in the language corpus have
been divided into sentences using a probabilistic
recognizer for sentence boundaries; we need to
check to make sure that all the boundaries proposed
by the software are in fact real sentence boundaries,
and that no sentence boundaries have been missed.
- The text has been processed by a named-entity
recognition engine and phrases have been marked
up as personal names, clan names, place names,
names of organizations, and other names, but the
process by which this has happened is not fully
trusted; we would like a specialist in the period and
genre to check that the distinctions among place
names, clan names, and personal names have been
drawn correctly.
19

Digital Humanities 2011

- Each of the seven hundred short documents in the
project must be checked for conformance to the
project's new rules for hyperlinks, and problems
need to be flagged (not fixed, just flagged for later
re-work).
- In a software development project, we have
developed a set of XML-encoded test cases which
the software should be able to handle. We have
now realized that each test case needs to include
metadata of a kind not originally foreseen. It needs
to be added manually (or perhaps we can write
a program that will get most of it right, but need
a manual check to catch errors, in cases where
manual fixing is cheaper than making the automatic
process do the right thing).
- We are converting a few thousand MARC records
into TEI headers. The conversion program tries
to strip off the trailing punctuation added in the
MARC record (additional full stops, semi-colons,
colons, etc., depending on the internal structure of
the MARC fields), but in a few cases out of every
thousand fields, the algorithm is not quite right. The
program writes out the TEI header with its best
guess at the correct content of the element, but
it also writes out the original trailing punctuation,
in a specially marked processing instruction. We
wish for some reasonably alert human being to go
through the material and say, for each field, whether
to accept the program's proposal or to restore the
original punctuation. In a very small number of
cases, neither the program's best guess nor the
original punctuation is correct, and the reviewer must
specify some third form of the data.
In each of these cases, a full-scale general-purpose
XML editor can be used but has a number of
drawbacks. The user performing the task must be
trained in the full editor, and once the document is
open in a general-purpose editor there are no limits to
what changes can be made, or in cases of inattention
or confusion, no limits to the damage that can be
infliced on the document. It would be preferable to
perform such specialized XML modification tasks in
what are sometimes called "padded cell" editors, which
provide simple limited interfaces for performing specific
tasks. In a padded cell editor for sentence-boundary
correction, for example, the user should be able to
open a document, delete sentence boundaries (joining
adjacent s elements), insert them (splitting s elements),
save the document, and quit. An editor which provides
ONLY those operations will be a lot easier to learn
than a general purpose editor, and allows a careless
or hapless user to do much less harm. Specialpurpose editors can also incorporate knowledge of
20

the underlying markup language and its usage in a
particular project more effectively than is possible for
general-purpose editors.
It has rarely been feasible, however, to use
conventional programming tools to build specialpurpose editors for individual XML vocabularies, let
alone such specialized tasks: using standard libraries,
such editors would run to thousands or tens of
thousands of lines of Java or Objective C.
XForms (and some related technologies) change the
equation.
XForms is built around the model / view / controller
idiom, in which the model is a set of XML documents,
the view is specified using XHTML and the XForms
widget set, and the controller takes the form of
declarative rules linking widgets to elements and
attributes in the markup. That is to say: XForms can
be regarded as a technology for building padded-cell
editors; it has great potential for extensive application
in any project making systematic use of XML.
The tutorial will comprise four blocks of material, of
about 45 minutes each.
1. Introduction
- origin and design goals of XForms
- the XForms model/view/controller processing
model
- XForms and padded-cell editors
2. Atomic values
- the standard XForms widgets
- datatypes and type awareness

Integrating Digital Humanities
Projects into the Undergraduate
Curriculum
Tomasek, Kathryn

ktomasek@wheatonma.edu
Wheaton College

Davis, Rebecca Frost

rdavis@nitle.org
National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education

Digital methods of analysis exert growing influence on
the practice of many disciplines in the humanities and
social sciences, yet students majoring in non-science
disciplines often have little exposure to computational
thinking. Although digital scholarship has become
more pervasive among humanists, we have yet
to recognize fully the value that collaboration with
undergraduates can bring to projects in this field.
The aim of this workshop is to invite digital humanists
to work together in considering how to integrate digital
scholarship into undergraduate or general introductory
level graduate courses.  Potential motivations include:
1. advancing digital humanities within the academy,
especially at the undergraduate level,
2. linking scholarship and teaching to move forward a
faculty member’s own project,
3. engaging students in humanities research through
technology,
4. developing digital literacy to help students function
well as citizens in the twenty-first century.
This workshop will present strategies for effectively
integrating digital projects into undergraduate courses.
By examining cases of assignments linked to digital
projects, participants will consider how to make room
for such assignments in a syllabus, how to tie digital
projects to a course’s learning outcomes, and how
to scaffold both technological and content learning
to allow students to make positive contributions to a
project external to the course. Participants will leave
with a set of pedagogical strategies for thinking about
digital projects, preliminary plans for assignments
for their own courses, and suggestions for how to
find collaborative partners in library and technology
services for such projects on their home campuses.

Part One: Rebecca Frost Davis will present an
overview of ways that digital humanities projects have
been integrated into the curriculum, contextualized
through the pedagogical approach of problem-based
learning and the principles of liberal education.
 Participants will look at a variety of examples, including
the Homer Multitext Project (www.homermultitext.o
rg) , SmartChoices (smartchoices.trincoll.edu) ,
and the NINES Collex (www.nines.org) .
Part Two: Kathryn Tomasek will present a case study
from the Wheaton College Digital History Project.   A
transcription and encoding assignment, this module
can be dropped into multiple courses.   It includes
scaffolded assignments; a teaching collaboration that
involves a faculty member, a technologist, and an
archivist; and multiple opportunities for students to
create and use new historical data whilst contributing
to larger digital history projects.
Part Three:  Participants will brainstorm and workshop
assignments for their own courses in breakout groups.
  Discussion will center on three areas, practical
questions about how to integrate assignments into
a course, how to pace and scaffold work on digital
projects, and questions about collaborative pedagogy.
  The workshop will conclude with discussion of
individual assignment ideas from the small groups.

2. Presenters
The organizers bring to the workshop fifteen
years’ combined experience in integrating technology
projects into the undergraduate curriculum.   Rebecca
Frost Davis, Program Officer for the Humanities at the
National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education
(NITLE), has been teaching faculty development
workshops on the effective pedagogical application of
technology since 2002.  Currently, she heads NITLE’s
initiative in digital humanities and researches the
growth of the field at small liberal arts colleges.  Kathryn
Tomasek, Associate Professor of History at Wheaton
College in Massachusetts, has been using the Text
Encoding Initiative in her courses since fall 2004.
  She is Co-Director of the Wheaton College Digital
History Project, a long-term digitization project that has
employed students as summer research assistants
and now includes a transcription and markup module
that Tomasek uses in multiple courses for advancedlevel History majors.   Davis and Tomasek will offer
the workshop described here as a Bootcamp at
THATCamp LAC, June 4-5, 2011, at St. Norbert
College in De Pere, Wisconsin.

1. Abstract
More and more, research in the humanities requires
making use and sense of datasets that represent the
structure and dynamics of complex natural and manmade systems. Recent trends in the digital humanities
have resulted in the wide-scale availability of this data.
The analysis, navigation, and management of these
large-scale, dynamically changing datasets requires a
new kind of tool, a macroscope (from macro, great, and
skopein, to observe).
Microscopes empowered our naked eyes to see cells,
microbes, and viruses, thereby advancing the progress
of biology and medicine. Telescopes opened our
minds to the immensity of the cosmos and prepared
mankind for the conquest of space. Macroscopes
22

Digital Humanities 2011

promise to help us cope with another infinite: the
infinitely complex. They allow us to detect patterns,
trends, and outliers, give access to details, present a
‘vision of the whole,’ and assist our ‘synthesis’ of what
we observe. While most microscopes and telescopes
are static physical instruments, macroscopes are
continuously changing bundles of software deployed
as cyberinfrastructures, Web services, or standalone
tools.
This tutorial presents and demonstrates CIShell
powered tools such as the Science of Science (Sci2)
Tool (http://sci.slis.indiana.edu/sci2) and the Network
Workbench (NWB) Tool (http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu).
The NWB Tools is a network analysis, modeling,
and visualization toolkit for physics, biomedical, social
science, and other multidisciplinary research. The
Sci2 Tool was specifically designed for researchers
and science policy makers interested to study and
understand the structure and dynamics of science.
These versatile tools can be utilized for humanities
data, allowing humanists to explore topical or social
networks within their areas of study. They will be
utilized for the analysis of temporal, geospatial,
topic, and network datasets, and the professional
visualization of analysis results by means of largeformat charts and maps. Both tools are standalone
desktop applications that install and run on Windows,
Linux x86 and Mac OSX.

Robert C. Allen, Natasha Smith, Pamella Lach;
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
http://www.docsouth.unc.egu/gtts
http://www.http://mainstreet.lib.unc.edu/

Going to the Show documents and illuminates the
experience of movies and moviegoing in North
Carolina from the introduction of projected motion

pictures (1896) to the end of the silent film era (circa
1930). Through its innovative use of more than 1000
digitally stitched and georeferenced Sanborn® Fire
Insurance maps of forty-five towns and cities between
1896 and 1922, the project situates early moviegoing
within the experience of urban life in the state's big
cities and small towns. Supporting its documentation
of more than 1300 movie venues across 200
communities is a searchable archive of thousands
of contemporaneous artifacts: newspaper ads and
articles, photographs, postcards, city directories, and
150 original architectural drawings.
Main Street, Carolina (in development) is a digital
history toolkit designed to allow cultural heritage
organizations in North Carolina to preserve, document,
and share the history of their downtowns by creating
and managing digital content and displaying it on
interactive historic maps.

2. Hypercities
Philip J. Ethington, Univ. of Southern California; Todd
Presner, Christopher Johanson, David Shepard, UCLA
http://hypercities.com/

Built on the idea that every past is a place, HyperCities
is a digital research and educational platform for
exploring, learning about, and interacting with the
layered histories of city and global spaces. Developed
though collaboration between UCLA and USC, the
fundamental idea behind HyperCities is that all stories
take place somewhere and sometime; they become
meaningful when they interact and intersect with
other stories. Using Google Maps and Google Earth,
HyperCities essentially allows users to go back in
time to create and explore the historical layers of
city spaces in an interactive, hypermedia environment.
A HyperCity is a real city overlaid with a rich

Walking Through Time is a smart phone web
application that allows architectural historians,
conservationists and tourists to download historical
maps of Edinburgh when standing in a specific location
and to annotate them. They can walk through real
space whilst following a map from 200 years ago (for
example) and tag and attach links to the map that offer
historical and contextual information.
Tales of Things is part of a research project called
TOTeM that will explore social memory in the emerging
culture of the Internet of Things. Researchers from
across the UK have provided this site as a platform
for users to add stories to their own treasured objects
and to connect to other people who share similar
experiences. This will enable future generations to
have a greater understanding of the object’s past and
offers a new way of preserving social history. Content
will depend on real people’s stories, which can be geolocated through an on-line map of the world where
participants can track their object even if they have
passed it on. The object will also be able to update
previous owners on its progress through a live Twitter
feed which will be unique to each object entered into
the system.

"Integrating Digital Papyrology" (IDP) is a series
of projects funded by the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation. It represents the integration of three
longstanding digital papyrology efforts: the Duke
Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDbDP), the
Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis der griechischen
Papyrusurkunden Ägyptens (HGV), and the Advanced
Papyrological Information System (APIS), and
the migration to a single format, the EpiDoc
recommendations for the application of TEI XML to
ancient documentary texts. 1
This panel aims first to present an historical overview
of the transformation of the DDbDP from a digital
index of print scholarship to a community-managed
resource for peer-reviewed scholarly control of core
disciplinary assets, and then to suggest some ways in
which we hope that the new suite of tools that we have
been building around the data may help to transform
scholarship in this important domain.
The DDbDP began in 1983 as a collaboration between
Duke University and David R. Packard. Greek and
Latin were encoded in Beta Code and searchable
on CD using custom software. In 1996/7 the DDbDP
migrated its authoritative version to the web-based
Perseus Project, encoded in Beta Code and TEI
SGML. In 2004/5 the DDbDP and HGV began
mapping their theretofore discrete but complementary
sets of text and descriptive metadata, while Duke
obtained a planning grant from the Mellon Foundation.

28

Digital Humanities 2011

Papyrologists, IT specialists, librarians and university
administrators came together to map out a sustainable
future for the DDbDP. The way forward was clear:
open source, standards-based development, greater
collaboration, increased vesting of data-control in the
user community, and greater interoperability with other
projects.
With clear objectives and generous support from the
Mellon Foundation, Duke launched IDP1 (2007/8). Its
goals were to migrate the DDbDP from SGML to
EpiDoc XML, and from Betacode Greek to Unicode
Greek; to merge DDbDP texts and HGV metadata and
translations into a single stream; to map these texts
to corresponding APIS records, including images; to
enhance the Papyrological Navigator (PN—see http://
papyri.info) to enable search of the newly merged
data. The fruits of these efforts were released under
open access provisions in October 2008 (all content
under CC BY and software under GNU GPL). In
October 2008 the team began work on IDP2, again
with support from Mellon. At the same time, APIS,
under a grant from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, began work on enhancing the PN, and
the two projects joined forces. The results of IDP2 are
(1) improved usability of the PN search interface on
the merged and mapped data from the DDbDP, HGV
and APIS, (2) facilitated third-party use of the data and
tools, and (3) a version controlled, transparent and fully
audited, multi-author, web-based, real-time, tagless
editing environment (SoSOL), which—in tandem with
a new editorial infrastructure—will allow the entire
community of papyrologists to take control of the
process of populating these communal assets. The
discipline is now on the cusp of having the the entire
life-cycle of the papyrological discipline represented
online in a transparent, open, peer-reviewed and
community-driven environment.

Lessons from the conversion
of the Duke Databank of
Documentary Papyri from legacy
formats into EpiDoc TEI XML

When the DDbDP began in 1983 at Duke University,
1Greek and Latin were encoded in Beta Code (an
ASCII representation of text in different scripts and
of various sigla and structural features, also used
by the TLG,2that combines language encoding and
some semantic markup features) and searchable
on CD-ROM via a dedicated platform provided by
the Packard Humanities Institute. These texts were
entered manually by students at Duke, following a
data entry manual, and using published editions of
papyrological texts as the basis. When the DDbDP
migrated from the CD-ROMs to the Web-based
Perseus Project, the texts were machine-translated to
a format mixing Beta Code and TEI P3 SGML (and
the resultant hybrid encoding formed the basis of an
updated data entry manual). 3
The first stage of the Mellon-funded Integrating
Digital Papyrology project (2007-2008) involved the
conversion of the DDbDP from largely regular
and sometimes consistent format, but highly varied
contents, into Unicode and EpiDoc XML. At this
point the hybrid encoding scheme was a mixture
of Beta Code (varying slightly over thirteen years
of evolution and multiple generations of graduate
students), machine-tagged TEI SGML (and handentered since the Perseus conversion). This basic
consistency, compromised but not destroyed by this
technical history of the project, is further complicated
by the wide variety of papyrological material, including
editions published over a century by editors with
differing standards of editorial detail, and even
29

Digital Humanities 2011

occasionally inconsistent uses of conventions. These
variations were somewhat, but not entirely, flattened
by data entry practice.
Due to the size of the dataset, some 55,000 records,
the conversion of these texts into both Unicode
character encoding and EpiDoc-conformant TEI XML
structural and semantic features had to be almost
entirely automated, with only a small amount of human
intervention for difficult or unique cases. This first
round of conversion work was carried out by a team
at the Centre for Computing in the Humanities at
King’s College London. The tools to convert from the
complex, legacy formats to the more sustainable, open
standard TEI XML were open source and based on
ongoing work in the EpiDoc community.
The CCH team built the data conversion as a fourstep pipeline: (1) the SGML was turned into validating
XML, and entities resolved, using a tool based on
OSX; 4(2) the Beta Code representation of Greek and
Coptic characters and certain symbols was converted
to Unicode using Transcoder; 5(3) a new set of
regular expressions was added to CHETC, 6a regular
expression-based conversion tool to convert much of
the structural Beta Code to XML; (4) XSLT was applied
to transform the XML produced by steps 1 and 3
into validating EpiDoc. In order to write these steps
simultaneously, and iteratively to improve the tools,
the process was pipelined so that the master copy of
the texts remained the Beta Code/SGML hybrid, which
continued to be manually improved. Only at the end of
the process, when the output validated to the EpiDoc
DTD, would the transformation be complete, and handfixes begin to be performed on this new version of the
DDbDP.
In the second phase of the project, work on the
DDbDP focussed on ongoing hand-fixes to the now
canonical XML to improve the consistency of the
text. This became ever more essential as the SoSOL
tool (see Baumann, below) requires very consistent,
valid EpiDoc. The EpiDoc recommendations were also
updated to TEI P5 in this phase, and both Duke texts
and HGV metadata encoded in this new format. The
third phase (awaiting funding decision) will work to
make the metadata translation into EpiDoc stable,
rather than a pipelined crosswalk as it is currently.
Among the important lessons we learned from
the DDbDP translation from the hybrid format to
standarized TEI XML are the following technical points
(all of value not only to our ongoing work with
HGV metadata, but potentially to others contemplating
large-scale up-coding from legacy formats):

30

1. Beta Code was a well-designed encoding scheme
for Ancient Greek script, but even so there were
issues that needed to be resolved. Where Unicode
has two characters for medial and terminal Greek
sigma (σ and ς), Beta considers these to be
unambiguous by position and so uses ‘S’ to
encode both. For a converter that had to parse
mixed-content XML, relying on position proved
unreliable. Similarly, Unicode now has separate
ranges for Greek and Coptic alphabets, but Beta
only distinguishes between the scripts in the case of
the six characters that are unique to Coptic. In the
Classics world there are also tools in wide use that
expect Beta Code input (for example the Morpheus
morphological parser), which is no doubt part of the
reason why this legacy format is in use so long after
the general adoption of Unicode.
2. Because of the complexity of even what seemed
to be the simplest task, above, the integrity of the
processing pipeline was especially important, since
changes at every stage could otherwise turn out
to be irreversible. At one stage, before the end of
the project, we decided to abandon the first step of
the conversion process and consider the validating
XML version to be the master copy. It was only after
several rounds of hand-fixes and global corrections
had been made to this new master copy, that we
noticed an error in the first step of the conversion
process, which lost an important distinction in some
thousands of cases. It was possible, but difficult, to
go back and diff the new version against the SGML
in this case, but the issue remains that moving from
a legacy master text to an automated improvement
of same requires careful checking.
3. Possibly the most interesting challenge in this
conversion process was the hybrid data format that
combined Beta Code sigla, SGML tags and entities
to encode structural and semantic information about
the papyrological editions. Translating these multiple
encoding schemes to valid EpiDoc XML was not
as simple as writing transformations for each
of the levels, since a span of lost or restored
text (represented by Beta Code brackets) and an
abbreviation (represented by SGML tags) might
overlap, leading to ill-formed XML. (In fact, it
is probably because of this thorny problem of
overlapping spans that the Beta Code was never
fully translated to SGML in the initial conversion).
The problem was ultimately solved by a combination
of fine-tuned Regex, XSLT and some handcorrection.
4. The interaction of regular expressions and XSLT in
the translation of the markup was also an important

Digital Humanities 2011

lesson. It was obvious from the start that Regexes
were suited to replacing textual sigla with XML,
and XSLT to transforming SGML/XML tags into
other XML, but the relationship between these two
processes was both complex and interesting. In
some cases it was simpler to replace sigla with
well-formed but invalid XML tags, and then fix
those to good EpiDoc with XSLT; in other cases
a combination of hand-fixing and one-off regular
expressions were used to regularize inconsistencies
to a single, consistent error, which the two stages of
the markup translation process could then fix in one
pass. The choice of which stage of the process to fix
any given issue proved to be worth careful planning.
(By the same token, it was important to decide when
the scale of a problem meant hand-fixing was more
efficient than a dynamic solution in the pipeline.)
5. Another important lesson was that sometimes the
markup in the papyrological editions was ambiguous
in a way that spanned two different semantic
distinctions in the EpiDoc guidelines (for example,
corrections and regularizations used the same
encoding in the DDbDP, but are represented by
choice/sic/corr and choice/orig/reg respectively in
TEI). Given the scale of the project it was impossible
to disambiguate the many thousands of instances of
these, and markup was devised to preserve this lack
of granularity.
6. Although 55,000 texts is not huge by database
standards, for a corpus of ancient texts in XML,
processed using XSLT it was larger than we had
dealt with before. The tools that had been adequate
for dealing with smaller numbers of text (individual
Java calls to the Saxon processor; Subversion
for version control) led to processes and commits
that took up to 24 hours at a time on the
scale of this project. The solutions were relatively
straightforward: pipelining multiple texts to Saxon
through one Java call saved 95% of the processing
time; migrating to Git from Subversion improved
commit speed manyfold. Such optimizations are
clearly essential at large scales.
7. The management of a distributed project (including
members from five institutions based in Alabama,
Heidelberg, Kentucky, London, New York, and
North Carolina) offered additional lessons. Project
communication is handled via several channels:
there is a project mailing list for asynchronous
conversations, we hold weekly conversations in
Skype between representatives from each location,
there is an always-on chatroom on IRC that project
members use for daily conversations, and we have
impromptu Skype calls when voice communication

is needed. In addition, we have held several weeklong, all-hands meetings during which planning
and intensive collaborative work is done. Project
communication and coordination does not follow the
management hierarchies of the member institutions,
and this flat organization greatly improves efficiency
and implementation speed.

PAPER 2

The Papyrological Navigator:
Project Integration with RDF
Cayless, Hugh

hugh.cayless@nyu.edu
New York University

One of the major difficulties encountered during IDP1
was the problem of aggregating related content. The
main purpose of the Papyrological Navigator (PN) is
to present a merged, searchable view of the DDbDP,
HGV, and APIS datasets. IDP1 attempted to produce
an aggregated dataset, where related DDbDP and
31

Digital Humanities 2011

HGV records were merged into a single EpiDoc
XML document. The mapping processes whereby
this was accomplished were flawed, however, and
resulted in both spurious and missing relationships.
In addition, combining documents from projects with
different update schedules and sometimes different
interpretations of what constitutes a document was
problematic. For IDP2, it was clear that the mapping
process would have to be re-imagined. The new
process, described in this paper, uses a combination
of semantic web technology and standard tools to
produce a merged collection.
IDP draws on datasets from the DDbDP, HGV, APIS,
and Trismegistos 1. The varied origins of these
projects meant that different decisions were made in
each about how to record information about source
documents. For example, if several pieces of papyrus
contain text that are part of the same "document,"
then DDbDP will tend to transcribe the whole, marking
the separate sheets of papyrus with <div> elements.
HGV on the other hand, tends to treat each piece
as an entity, each with its own record. APIS, since
it is essentially a unified export of the catalogs of
museums and libraries with papyrus holdings, treats
the document the way the host collection does. While
APIS is organized according to the source collection,
DDbDP and HGV use the publication history of the
papyrus as an organizing principle. HGV has the
idea of a "principal edition," i.e. the best published
version of the papyrus. DDbDP is similarly based on
a single published edition, though HGV and DDbDP
may not agree on what is the principal edition. When a
better publication comes out for an existing document,
DDbDP replaces the existing document with the new
version, leaves a "stub" record with a pointer to the
new version in place of the old, and the new edition
points back at the old one. HGV, similarly, sometimes
retires identifiers. But these updates are not always
efficiently propagated across projects, so references
may become stale over time.
DDbDP identifiers are constructed from short-form
citations of the document edition on which the
transcription was based, so, for example bgu;1;2 is the
identifier for the 2nd item in the first volume in the BGU
( Aegyptische Urkunden aus den Königlichen (later
Staatlichen) Museen zu Berlin, Griechische Urkunden
) series. Trismegistos assigns numeric identifiers to
individual documents (e.g. 1234), and HGV bases
its identifiers on these. When HGV data is finergrained than TM, it will append alphabetic characters
to the TM id (e.g. 1234a, 1234b, etc.). APIS bases its
identifiers on the collection name plus a number, e.g.
berkeley.apis.15.
32

DDbDP and HGV began the process of reconciling
their collections in 2004, so where there are
correspondences, the documents include the id
numbers of related records in their document headers.
For example, http://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.oxy;4;744/
source encodes identifiers both for itself and for the
related HGV record in its publicationStmt:

Likewise, http://papyri.info/hgv/20442/source,
the related HGV record, contains the DDbDP identifier
in its header:

In this (simple) case, the relationships are easy
to establish, and can be represented in RDF
(using N3 syntax) thus: <http://papyri.info/ddbdp/
p.oxy;4;744/source>
<http://purl.org/dc/terms/
relation>
<http://papyri.info/hgv/20442/source>
<http://papyri.info/hgv/20442/source>
<http://
purl.org/dc/terms/relation>
<http://papyri.info/
ddbdp/p.oxy;4;744/source>
That is, the resource

http://papyri.info/ddbdp/p.oxy;4;744/source has a
"relation" (which is a term drawn from the Dublin
Core Metadata Initiative Terms 2list) http://papyri.info/
hgv/20442/source, and the latter has a reciprocal
relationship to the former.

The question of aggregation becomes much more
complicated when APIS enters the equation. Because
of its origin as a union catalog (the data for which was
contributed by a variety of insitutions), the quality of
APIS’s information is more uneven. The method used
by the first version of the PN to establish relationships
with DDbDP, namely looking for matching citations,
produced results that were sometimes inaccurate.
For IDP2, we looked for pieces of information that
could be extracted (like the <idno>s in DDbDP and
HGV) and represented as RDF triples. HGV contains
URLs for images of papyri and ostraka when they are
available, and when these are hosted at Columbia
(the original home of APIS), they contain the same
APIS id as the APIS documents do. In addition,

Digital Humanities 2011

APIS records sometimes include references to the
relevant DDbDP document in their bibliography: <bibl
type="ddbdp">P.Oxy.:4:744</bibl> This does not use
the DDbDP identifier scheme, but it can be converted
to the DDbDP identifier, p.oxy;4;744 easily enough.
APIS contains some spurious references of this type
(to collections that don’t exist, for example), but all that
is needed to check their validity is to check for the
existence of a corresponding DDbDP file.
In addition to the collections mentioned above, there
are also HGV translations, which use the same
numbering scheme as the HGV metadata, and APIS
images, which are represented by a static RDF file
mapping image names to APIS ids. A representation
of the incomplete graph that can be constructed by
extracting these relations from the source documents
looks something like:

So there are locations in an IDP EpiDoc document
(and in associated artifacts) where we can check for
reference information, and from these we can build
a (partial) graph of relationships between documents
in the three collections. The database import method
is simple. A program crawls each directory in our
repository containing EpiDoc documents, runs each
through an XSLT transformation which converts it to
RDF XML, and inserts that RDF into a Mulgara# triple
store. Once the relations have been converted to RDF,
we can do some simple inferencing to "fill out" the
rest of the incomplete relation graph. In practice, this
means running SPARQL queries that produce results
like "A is related to B, because B is related to A" and
"A is related to C, because A is related to B and B is
related to C," and then inserting the results of those
queries back into the triple store. The resulting graph
looks more like:

Besides relation data, we can also extract hierarchical
and bibliographical information from the collection.
Because DDbDP’s identifiers are hierarchical and
carry meaning, they can be decomposed and used
to identify not just the items, but their containers, the
volumes and series in which they were published.
APIS ids can be decomposed to collection and item.
HGV and TM ids are opaque, but HGV’s principal
edition bibliographic record can be used to construct
a hierarchy for that collection. HGV’s bibliography also
points to the primary source for its record.
The APIS, DDbDP, and HGV collections are hosted
in the Papyrological Navigator, while TM has its
own website. This means that we are able to mint
URLs using the APIS, DDbDB, and HGV identifiers,
so http://papyri.info/ddbdp/bgu;1;2/source represents
the EpiDoc XML document that transcribes BGU 1
2, http://papyri.info/ddbdp/bgu;1;2 retrieves an HTML
document that aggregates the DDbDP transcription
with metadata from HGV #8961 and links out
to TM #8961, http://papyri.info/ddbdp/bgu;1;2/rdf is
shorthand for an RDF query that pulls together
a subgraph of triples with http://papyri.info/ddbdp/
bgu;1;2/source as the subject, and so on.
The primary internal uses of the RDF triple store
in papyri.info are as the driver for generating and
indexing the site, and as a means for SoSOL (see
Ryan Baumann’s paper) to reference valid identifiers.
The method for generating the site uses the triple
store to load, first, all of the identifiers associated with
DDbDP using the hierarchical relations, then all of the
HGV ids not linked to a DDbDP identifier, then all
of the unrelated APIS identifiers. The collections are
then transformed to HTML, and the files corresponding
to file identifiers (along with any related EpiDoc
documents) are transformed both to HTML and to
Solr add documents, which are then ingested into the
search engine. In this fashion, we create the entire

33

Digital Humanities 2011

papyri.info site, with correctly aggregated data, using
a few basic tools.
Developments slated for the near future include using
the triple store as a container for relations to external
projects. An effort was made during the summer
of 2010 to link HGV place names to Pleiades and
Trismegistos Places URLs, and once the data has
been processed, it will be loaded into our triple store
and used as the basis for linking to data at these sites.
We hope, for example, to be able to display maps
drawn from Pleiades, as well as linking to the site.
Another planned use for the triple store is to have it
handle the normalization and display of bibliography
for papyri.info.
The method outlined above for extracting data from
source documents, storing it as RDF triples, and
then using inferencing to fill out gaps in the graph
has potential applications well beyond papyri.info. For
example, it could be used to manage relationships
between EAD finding aids and digitized archives, or
to merge data from other overlapping collections.
Any data management situation where joins between
discrete but related objects as desired, and where it is
possible to extract a partial relationship graph from the
sources could profit from using semantic web tools in
this fashion.

PAPER 3

The Son of Suda Online:
Collaborative editing and
workflow tool
Baumann, Ryan

rfbaumann@gmail.com
University of Kentucky

The Son of Suda On Line 1(SoSOL) is one of the
main components of the Integrating Digital Papyrology
project (IDP), aiming to provide a repurposable
web-based editor for the digital resources in the
DDbDP and HGV. SoSOL integrates a number of
technologies to provide a truly next-generation online

34

editing environment. Using JRuby 2with the Rails 3web
framework, it is able to take advantage of Rails’s wide
support in the web development community, as well
as Java’s excellent XML libraries and support. This
includes the use of XSugar 4to define an alternate,
lightweight syntax for EpiDoc XML markup, called
Leiden+. Because XSugar uses a single grammar to
define both syntaxes in a reversible and bidirectional
manner, this is ideal for reducing side effects of
transforming text in our version-controlled system.
SoSOL uses the Git 5distributed version control system
as its versioning backend, allowing it to use the
powerful branching and merging strategies it provides,
and enabling fully-auditable version control. SoSOL
also provides for editorial control of changes to the
main data repository, enabling the democracy of
allowing anyone to change anything they choose
while preserving the academic integrity of canonical
published data. This talk will provide a demonstration
of these features of SoSOL as implemented for IDP2,
as well as a discussion of its repurposable design
for applicability to other projects and the ongoing
documentation work being done to increase usability
and adoption in the wider community.

1.1. Next-Generation Version Control
Many online editing environments, such as MediaWiki,
use an SQL database as the sole mechanism for
storing revisions. This can lead to a number of
problems, such as scaling (most SQL servers are
not performance optimized for large text fields) and
distribution of data (see for example the database
downloads of the English Wikipedia, which have
been notoriously problematic for obtaining the full
revision history). Most importantly, they typically
impose a centralized, linear, single-branch version
history. Because Git is a distributed version control
system, it does not impose any centralized workflow.
As a result, branching and merging have been given
high priority in its development, allowing for much
more concurrent editing activity while minimizing the
difficulty of merging changes. SoSOL’s use of Git
is to have one "canonical" Git repository for public,
approved data and to which commits are restricted.
Users and boards each get their own Git repositories
which act as forks of the canonical repository. This
allows them to freely make changes to their repository
while preserving the version history as needed when
these changes are merged back into the canonical
repository. These repositories can also be easily
mirrored, downloaded, and worked with offline and
outside of SoSOL due to the distributed nature of
Git. 6This enables a true democracy of data, wherein

Digital Humanities 2011

institutions still retain control and approval of the data
which they put their names on, but any individual may
easily obtain the full dataset and revision history to edit,
contribute to, and republish under the terms of license.

1.2. Alternative Syntax for XML Editing
While XML encoding has many advantages, users
inexperienced with its use may find its syntax difficult
or verbose. It is still desirable to harness the expertise
of these users in other areas and ease their ability
to add content to the system, while retaining the
semantically explicit nature of XML markup. To do
this, we have used XSugar to allow the definition of
a "tagless" syntax for EpiDoc XML, which resembles
that of the traditional printed Leiden conventions for
epigraphic and papyrological texts where possible.
Structures which are semantically ambiguous or
undefined in Leiden but available in EpiDoc (e.g.
markup of numbers and their corresponding value)
have been given additional text markup, referred to
comprehensively as Leiden+. XSugar enables the
definition of this syntax in a single, bidirectional
grammar file which defines all components of both
Leiden+ and EpiDoc XML as correspondences, which
can be statically checked for reversibility and validity.
This provides much more rigorous guarantees of
these properties than alternatives such as using
separate XSLT stylesheets for each direction of the
transform, as well as encoding the relation between the
components of each syntax in a single location.
As an example, we might have the following XML
fragment:

Corresponding to the typical Leiden print transcription:

While transforming the XML to Leiden+ through our
XSugar grammar yields:

As you can see, things such as the Greek letter "κ"
on line four being the number "20" are implicit in print,
but explicit in both EpiDoc and Leiden+. The user can
work on either the Leiden+ or XML representation of
the text, and we store only the XML representation in
our data repository (that is, the Leiden+ representation
is only an intermediate form used for editing and is
transformed back to XML when saved). A traditional
Leiden "print preview" is possible by applying the
standard EpiDoc XSLT stylesheets to this XML. In
theory, this particular XSugar grammar could be reused by other EpiDoc projects wishing to enable the
same kind of alternative markup.

1.3. Repurposable Design
Due to institutional requirements, the DDbDP and
HGV datasets needed separate editorial control and
publishing mechanisms. In addition, their control over
different types of content necessitated different editing
mechanisms for each component. These requirements
informed the design of how SoSOL interacts with data
under its control and how this design is repurposable
for use in other projects. The two high-level
abstractions of data made by SoSOL are "publications"
and "identifiers" . Identifiers are unique strings which
can be mapped to a specific file path in the repository,
while publications are arbitrary aggregations of
identifiers. By defining an identifier superclass which
defines common functionality for interacting with the
data repository, we can then subclass this to provide
functionality specific to a given category of data. The
SoSOL implementation for IDP2, for example, provides
identifier subclasses for DDbDP transcriptions, HGV
metadata, and HGV translations. Editorial boards
consequently have editorial control for only certain
subclasses of identifiers. Publications in turn allow
representation and aggregation of the complex many35

Digital Humanities 2011

to-many relationships these components can have (for
example, a document with two sides that may have
one transcription and two metadata components).
Packaging these related elements together both allows
the user to switch between them and editorial boards
to check related data which they may not have
editorial control over but still require to make informed
decisions about validity and approval. SoSOL can
thus be integrated into other systems by implementing
the identifier subclasses necessary for the given
dataset as well as coherent means for aggregating
these components into publications. One can imagine
the simplest implementation as being an identifier
whose name is the file path, which just presents the
plaintext contents of the file for editing, and which
has no relationships with other identifiers so that each
publication is a single identifier.

1.4. Conclusions
Though SoSOL is still under development, early
reception and feedback at training workshops
conducted to introduce users to the system has been
good. Thousands of texts have been created, edited, or
corrected, and submitted through the editorial boards
for voting, peer review, and publication. In addition
to being publicly viewable through the Papyrological
Navigator, these changes are regularly mirrored to
a public copy of the Git data repository available
on GitHub, where anyone may view and download
the complete revision history (see previous footnote).
Under IDP3, the currently-active final phase of the IDP
project, user experience studies are being conducted
and feedback from this process will be incorporated
into the system.
In addition to the possible reuse of the system itself, we
hope the more general goal of making data available
with the full revision history will become a more widely
adopted practice in digital humanities. Particularly for
collaborative editing projects, this can allow anyone to
see how changes have actually been effected, even
outside of the specific editing environment employed.
We feel that using a distributed version control system
such as Git as the core data backend is conducive to
this goal, as it enables easy distribution and updating
of the data set alongside its complete version history.
Thus, even if our particular editing environment is
eventually outdated and replaced, or the data needs to
be interacted with and edited using other mechanisms,
the data backend can still be used for the next
generation of tools and scholars.

New Models of Digital
Materialities

One persistent myth of the digital age is that it
differs fundamentally from all previous information
epochs because in digital form information has finally
achieved the long-standing historical aspiration to
unburden itself from the shackles of matter. As a mere
collection of 0s and 1s, digital information is imagined
to be independent of the particular media on which
it is stored—hard drive, optical disk, etc.—and the
particular signal carrier which encode bits, whether
magnetic polarities, voltage intensities, or pulses of
light. Digital information also achieves a separation of
content and form that could only be partially realized
with analog carriers. This fantasy has implications for
the ways we think about design, preservation, storage,
use, and every other aspect of digital media. What can
the digital humanities learn from and contribute to an
engagement with the many aspects of the materialities
of information?
The authors of these three papers undertake a
common questioning of this purported independence
from matter, a concept that has two distinct and
important consequences: (a) the idea that digital
information can be reproduced and distributed at
negligible cost and high speed, and thus, is immune
to the economics and logistics of analog media; (b)
and that it can be accessed, used, or reproduced
without the noise, corruption, and degradation that
necessarily results from the handling of material
carriers of information. Thus the concept of digital
information as immaterial is fundamental to the ability
of the digital to upend the analog world, and the
foundation of a belief that any media that can be
digitized or produced digitally will eventually succumb
to the logics of digital information and its circulation

through electronic networks—an argument powerfully
encapsulated by Negroponte’s slogan, “from atom to
bits.”
Such widespread assumptions have obscured the
specific material constraints that obtain in digital
environments. Only recently that the issue has
emerged as a legitimate concern for scholarly enquiry
—engaging concepts of materiality from literary, visual,
media, and cultural studies and bringing them to bear
on the analysis of digital environments. The papers
in this session take up some of these issues by
reading the machines, the specific properties of digital
media from surface screen to deeper structures, as
a demonstration of the ways the materiality of digital
media can be engaged. The purpose of this work is
to inform some of the basic tasks of digital humanists
– the interpretation of digital media artifacts, the skills
sets necessary to interrogate these artifacts, but also,
our responsibility for the preservation and use of these
objects as part of our cultural legacy.

“Infrastructural Thinking” as Core
Computing Skill
Blanchette, Jean-François
blanchette@gseis.ucla.edu
Information Studies, UCLA

It is often suggested that all digital humanists would
benefit from learning programming. Through the
acquisition of this core skill, they would engage
with the practice that defines computing and directly
experience its possibilities and constraints. Beyond
mere mastery of a language, programming would
expose them to formal methods for abstracting
and modeling concepts and real-world phenomena.
The current wave of interest in a “computational
thinking” pedagogical paradigm mirrors this argument:
computer science is primarily about modeling and
abstraction of phenomena in ways amenable to
algorithmic processing.
In this paper, I argue that programming, or its
more complex formulation, “computational thinking,”
provides only a partial picture of computing, and
correspondingly, only a partial skill set. A fuller picture
requires engagement with the material foundations
of computing. I use “material” here in a very literal

37

Digital Humanities 2011

sense, to point to the physicality of bits (their
encoding as magnetic polarities, voltages, etc) and the
material constraints of the devices that process, store,
and transport them. While the material dimension
of computing constantly informs the practices of
the computing professions, this dimension is also
repressed, in the context of a general discourse
that has emphasized the abstract dimension of the
digital over its material substrate. Yet, this materiality,
perhaps unexpectedly, holds the key to analyzing the
shape and evolution of the computing infrastructure.
And while digital humanists may well benefit from
engaging in “computational thinking,” I will argue the
computing infrastructure implicitly performs much of
that thinking, before a single line of application code is
written.
While programming deals with creating applications
that provide service to users, infrastructure software
provides services to applications, by mediating
their access to computing resources, the physical
devices that provide processing power, storage, and
networking. Infrastructure software is most commonly
encountered in the form of operating systems, but
is also embedded in hardware (the firmware in a
hard drive) or in specialized computers (e.g., web
servers, or routers). Whatever its specific form,
the role of infrastructure software is to provide a
series of transformations whereby the signals that
encode bits on some physical media (fiber optic,
magnetic drive, electrical wires) become accessible for
symbolic manipulation by applications. Infrastructure
software must be able to accommodate growth in size
and traffic, technical evolution and decay, diversity
of implementations, integration of new services to
answer unanticipated needs, and emergent behaviors,
among other things. It must provide programmers
with stable interfaces to system resources in the
face of continuously evolving computing hardware—
processors, storage devices, networking technologies,
etc.
The computing industry manages to accomplish
this feat through the design strategy of modularity,
whereby a module’s implementation can be
designed and revised without knowledge of other
modules’ implementation. Modularity performs this
magic by decoupling functional specification from
implementation: operating systems, for example,
enable applications to open, write to, and delete
files, without any knowledge of the specific storage
devices on which these files reside. This decoupling
provides the required freedom and flexibility for the
management, coordination, and evolution of complex
technical systems. However, in abstracting from
38

specific implementations of physical resources, such
decoupling necessarily involves efficiency trade-offs.
The TCP/IP protocols for example provide abstractions
of networks that favor resilience (the network can
survive nuclear attacks) over quality of service (the
network provides no minimum delays for delivery of
packets). Applications sensitive to such delays (e.g.,
IP telephony or streaming media) must thus overcome
the infrastructural bias of the protocols to secure the
quality of service they require.
An important point is that efficiency trade-offs (or
biases) embedded in a given modular organization
become entrenched through their institutionalization in
a variety of domains: standards, material infrastructure
(e.g., routers), and social practices (e.g. technical
training) may all provide for the endurance of
particular sets of abstraction. This entrenchment is
further enabled by the economies of scale such
institutionalization affords. An immediate consequence
is that the computing infrastructure, like all other
infrastructures, is fundamentally conservative in
character. Yet, it is also constantly under pressure from
the need to integrate changes in the material basis
of computing: multi-core, cloud-based, and mobile
computing are three emerging material changes that
will register at almost every level of the infrastructure.
Computing, it turns out, is material through and
through. But this materiality is diffuse, parceled
out and distributed throughout the entire computing
ecosystem. It is always in subtle flux, structured
by the persistence of modular decomposition, yet
pressured to evolve as new materials, requiring new
tradeoffs emerge. This paper thus argues that, in a
very literal and fundamental sense, materiality is a
key entry point for reading infrastructural change, for
identifying opportunities for innovation that leverage
such change, and for acquiring a deep understanding
of the possibilities and constraints of computing.
This understanding is not particularly provided by
exposure to programming languages. Rather, it
requires familiarity with the conflicts and compromises
of standardization, with the principles of modularity and
layering, and with a material history of computing that
largely remains to be written.

PAPER 2

Performative Materiality and
Interpretative Interface
Drucker, Johanna

drucker@gseis.ucla.edu
Information Studies, UCLA

Approaches to interface design have come mainly from
the HCI community, with an emphasis on maximum
efficiency in the user-centered experience. Since the
days of Douglas Engelbart and Ivan Sutherland’s
experiments with head sets, pedals, mice, and
screens, in work that led to the development of
the Graphical User Interface, the dominant paradigm
in the human-machine relationship has come from
an engineering sensibility. Leading practitioners in
that field, from Stuart Card, Ben Shneiderman, and
others, have defined basic principles for design
methodology and display that are premised on a
mechanistic analysis of user’s abilities to process
information effectively. This approach, taken from flight
simulators and applied to the vast numbers of tasks
for searching navigating, buying, and communicating
online, is grounded in a user-as-consumer model.
Criticisms from inside that community, such as the
work of Jesse James Garrett (showing the confusion
between information and task based approaches) or
Aaron Marcus’s group (analyzing cultural differences
and their connection to interface functionality) have
provided useful insights and shifted design principles
to be more nuanced. But the basic model of the
user-centered approach to interface design remains
in place. And it has been adopted by humanists,
particularly when the resources to do so are available.
If we bring the legacy of critical theory to bear on
this model, however, we see that the same critique
leveled by post-structuralists against New Criticism
is pertinent here. The “text” of an interface is not a
thing, stable and self-evident, whose meaning can
be fixed through a detailed reading of its elements.
An interface is a site of provocation for reading,
and, in the same manner as a film, literary work,
or any other “text” (fashion magazine, instruction
manual), it is a space for interpretation involved
an individual subject, not a generic user. In critical
parlance, both an enunciating and enunciated subject
– the speaking and the spoken subject – are aspects
of textual production. (Text here is meant broadly.)
This concept of performativity, articulated by John

Austin in How to do things with Words, has echoes
within the field of anthropology, gender studies, and
cultural studies. By situating texts and speakers within
pragmatic circumstances of use, ritual, exchange, and
communities of practice, performativity stripped away
any foundation for thinking meaning was inherent in
a text or work. Performativity offered a sharp rebuke
to notions of agency (individuals) and autonomy (of
texts).
How can we, that is, the community of digital
humanists, take these critical insights from literary,
cultural, and gender studies into our current practice?
If the object is merely to demonstrate that one may
read an interface with the same techniques we used
to read Young Mr. Lincoln or to follow Laura Mulvey’s
arguments into a new realm of semiotic analysis, a
rather tedious and predictable path would like ahead.
This might have some value in the undergraduate
classroom, as the unpacking of ideological subtexts
fascinates the young. But for those of us concerned
with the design of environments for digital humanities
and its research agendas, the questions that arise
from this critical encounter are quite different. Can
we conceive of models of interface that are genuine
instruments for research? That are not merely queries
within pre-set data that search and sort according to an
immutable agenda? How can we imagine an interface
that allows content modeling, intellectual argument,
rhetorical engagement? In such an approach, the
formal, graphical materiality of the interface might
register the performative dimensions as well as support
them. Such approaches would be distinct from those
in the HCI community in terms of their fundamental
values. In place of transparency and clarity, they would
foreground ambiguity and uncertainty, unresolvable
multiplicities in place of singularities and certainties.
Sustained interpretative engagement, not efficient
completion of tasks, would be the desired outcome.
This is not an argument in favor of bad design. Nor is
it a perverse justification for the ways in which underresourced projects create confusion, as if that were a
value for humanists. Quite the contrary. The challenge
of creating an interface in which the performative
character of interpretation can be supported and
registered builds on demonstrable principles: multiple
points of view, correlatable displays, aggregated data,
social mediation and networking as a feature of
scholarly work, and some of the old, but still charming,
qualities of games like Nomic, with their emerging rule
sets.
My argument is that the humanities embody a set of
values and approaches to knowledge as interpretation
that cannot be supported by a mechanistic approach
39

Digital Humanities 2011

to design. This is not just a semantic exercise, but
a point of departure for implementation. The concept
of performative materiality has a double meaning
here. In the first sense, materiality is understood
to produce meaning as a performance, just as any
other “text” is constituted through a reading. That
notion is fundamental to humanistic approaches to
interpretation as situated, partial, non-repeatable. In
the second sense, performative materiality suggests
an approach to design in which use registers in the
substrate and structure so that the content model and
its expressions evolve. The “structure of knowledge”
becomes a “scheme of knowing” that inscribes use
as well as provoking it. The idea of a user-consumer
is replaced by a maker-producer, a performer, whose
performance changes the game. This takes us back
to some of the earlier theory of games, to the work of
Brenda Laurel and others, whose theoretical training
brought notions of subjectivity and performance into
the study of online environments.
This paper does not claim to have a toolset of
design solutions, since by definition, that would put
us right back into the HCI model. Instead, it is an
attempt to lay out some basic ideas on which to
imagine a performative approach to materiality and the
design of an interpretative interface. Such an interface
supports acts of interpretation (does not merely return
selected results from a pre-existing data set) and
also is changed by acts of interpretation, it evolves.
Performative materality and interpretative interface are
co-dependent and emergent.

PAPER 3

Checksums: Digital Materiality in
the Archive
Kirschenbaum, Matthew

mgk@umd.edu
Department of English; Maryland Institute for
Technology in the Humanities, University of Maryland

The general conversation about “materiality” in digital
media has been ongoing for quite some time (notably
Markley 1997; Hayles 2002). A number of new foci,
models, and constructions have also recently been
introduced into the conversation around the term.
These include Kirschenbaum’s “formal materiality”
and accompanying work on digital forensics (2008),
the “media archeology” paradigm emerging out of
40

several key European writers following in the wake of
Friedrich Kittler (Parikka 2007, Ernst 2005), and the
platform studies approach developed and encouraged
by Montfort and Bogost (2009). At the same time,
in the archival community, practitioners are finding
themselves confronted with the materiality of borndigital objects in palpable and often increasingly
time-sensitive real-world ways: as more and more
collections begin to process and receive digital storage
media as elements in the acquisition of personal
“papers” from writers, politicians, and other public
figures, those charged with their long-term care are
implementing their own working models of materiality
as they make decisions about what to save, what
to index, and what to provide access to. (Given the
venue for this year’s conference, it’s worth noting that
Stanford University Libraries has been a pioneer in this
area, with such efforts as the Self-Archiving Legacy
Toolkit (SALT), the AIMS project on Born-Digital
Collections and New Models for Inter-Institutional
Model for Stewardship, and their participation in the
Preserving Virtual Worlds project.) This paper will
therefore seek to evaluate recent developments in
the theoretical conversation about digital materiality in
the specific context of applied practice in the archival
community. However, it will not assume that borndigital archival content can function only as a testbed for the various theoretical models; instead, it
will also look at how the decisions being made in
archival settings have the potential to inform critical
and theoretical discourse.
The paper follows a case-study approach. Thus, it
will consider media archeology, which one definition
glosses as “histories of suppressed, neglected, and
forgotten media [. . .] ones that do not point
selectively and teleologically to the present cultural
situation and currently dominant media as their
'perfection’” (Huhtamo 2010) in light of the Deena
Larsen Collection at the University of Maryland.
Larsen, who is traditionally associated with the
Eastgate stable of hypertext authors through work
such as Marble Springs (1993) and Samplers (1997)
has deposited a large and heterogeneous array
of hardware, software, storage media (some eight
hundred 3½-inch diskettes), notebooks, manuscripts,
correspondence, and ephemera at the Maryland
Institute for Technology in the Humanities. This
material includes a number of items related to her
best-known work, Marble Springs (1993), written in
Hypercard and published the same year, it turns out, as
a much more famous work of digital storycraft, Cyan’s
Myst, also authored in Hypercard. The Maryland
collection includes the original text, with annotations,
as a manuscript in a notebook, various electronic

Digital Humanities 2011

drafts and early implementations, installed copies of
the work (which allows the user to add marginal
notes, thus creating the capacity to render every copy
unique), and most unusually, a shower curtain which
contains laminated screenshots of different nodes
(lexia) pasted up and linked together with colored string
to diagram the affective relations between the different
elements of the text. How can media archeology,
which, following Foucault’s venerable formulations,
seeks to tease out “hitherto unnoticed continuities and
ruptures” (Huhtamo 2010) inform curatorial practice
around this work? Among other things, this paper will
argue for a network-oriented model of access, whereby
a user of the collection, through metadata packaging,
is encouraged to access and evaluate items in relation
to one another rather than in isolation, as atomized
treasures sprung from a Hollinger box (or its digital
equivalent, a FEDORA record).
Similarly, the platform studies approach advocated
by Montfort and Bogost will be evaluated in relation
to a second recent project from MITH, a site
devoted to vintage computing which uses a considered
metadata and modeling approach to computing
hardware, whereby individual components of the
vintage machines are documented, contextualized
within their relation to the system as a whole, and
expressed using Dublin Core. While not “platform
studies” in its own right, the extent to which formalized
representations of vintage computing systems can
serve as the basis for further work in that vein is
important, since there are currently few precedents
for cataloging actual artifacts of computer history,
and in particular considering specific components as
individualized entities rather than as generic classes of
mass-produced material. The paper will therefore ask
what kind of documentation and metadata a scholar
interested in the affordances and individuality of a
particular computing system would need in order to use
a cataloged instance as the basis for critical work in the
platform studies model.

the machine” as a contemporary operating system
becomes the proxy for one long (un)dead. “Agrippa”
itself, with its themes of memory, media, and loss is
an apt vehicle for a meditation on formal materiality
and the limits of absolute emulation, especially since
there is one overridingly obvious fact about any
virtual implementation or emulation of “Agrippa”: unlike
the original, which, famously, was a one-off “run”
encrypted with a military-grade one-way key, here
one can spawn “images” of the original disk at will
and pass them through the emulator time and again.
Emulation, the paper concludes, is finally chimerical
as is, perhaps, the notion of formal materiality
itself: virtualization will always be interrupted by the
individuality of original events.
One last word: the paper has a broader agenda beyond
putting theory through its paces, using archival content
as a “checksum” for critical debate. Digital humanities
itself, as a community, has much to offer to ongoing
efforts in the archives world, yet thus far there has been
a curious gulf between the two, with only a handful of
individuals serving as ambassadors between the two
communities. If digital humanities can offer a forum in
which the artifacts and objects of contemporary cultural
heritage, many of which will be born-digital rather
than digitized, can serve as the basis for critical and
technical inquiry then it will be well positioned to take
part in the increasingly urgent societal conversation
around the future of our digital and material present.

Finally, the paper will consider Kirschenbaum’s
interwoven strands of formal and forensic materiality in
relation to an event which post-dated his 2008 book,
the recovery, reconstitution, and successful emulation
of the original software program for William Gibson’s
famously self-effacing poem “Agrippa” (Kirschenbaum,
et al. 2009). Emulation in particular allows us to
usefully consider the armature of “formal materiality,”
since emulation functions precisely to naturalize or
operationalize one baseline computing system as the
virtual host for a working instantiation of another.
Yet emulation is also an uncanny event, a kind of
literalization of the age-old conceit of the “ghost in

PlotVis is a 3D system for people interested in
examining narrative action, or plot, from a variety
of perspectives. The system was developed as
one outcome of a funded study examining the
teaching of complex narrative forms in secondary and
undergraduate classrooms. Results of this study have
revealed, inter alia, that conventional approaches to
teaching fiction, particularly at the secondary level,
fail to take account of the diversity of contemporary
narrative (cf Dobson, 2006).
For example, instructors, particularly at the secondary
level, still rely heavily on the five-stage plot mapping
first described by Gustav Freytag (1863) in Die Technik
des Dramas (Figure 1), and the superimposition of this
model on forms beyond those it was originally intended
to describe can be misleading (Dobson, Michura,
Ruecker, 2010).

42

Figure 1: Freytag’s Pyramid shows five basic components
of plot, based on Greek and Shakespearean tragedy.

In addition, the reliance on the Cartesian graph to
model narrative generally – and there are a number
of examples of such graphing (e.g., Sterne, 1847;
Vonnegut, 1973) – is restricting because it fails to take
account of the multiple dimensions of story.
Considering the limitations of the Cartesian graph for
modeling narrative along with conceptualizations of
narrative as multidimensional (e.g., Shields, 2000),
our goal was to produce a three-dimensional digital
environment that reifies different perspectives on plot,
so that students and other scholars can quickly
shift from one 3D object to another, or spend time
exploring any of the visualizations in more detail. We
currently support three perspectives and are beginning
to experiment with the design of a fourth.
This panel will examine the results of the PlotVis
project from several different perspectives, including
an introduction to the project, schema design for
narrative encoding, a reading practices study, and
design and programming.

2. Introduction to PlotVis as a Form of Distant
Reading
" … what we really need is a little pact with the devil: we
know how to read texts, now let’s learn how not to read
them. Distant reading: where distance, let me repeat
it, is a condition of knowledge: it allows you to focus
on units that are much smaller or much larger than the
text: devices, themes, tropes—or genres and systems.
(Moretti, 2000, p. 57)."
Recently, literary theorists and digital humanists alike
have taken up Moretti’s appeal, later developed in
Graphs, Maps, Trees (2005), for the development of
new methods of textual analysis. Clement (2008), for
example, uses mapping techniques and visualizations
to facilitate, quite literally, new perspectives on
a canonical text, Gertrude Stein’s The Making of
Americans. By premising knowledge on distance
rather than closeness, Clement discerns significant
patterns in the narrative’s structure, in so doing

Digital Humanities 2011

discovering a new logic to Stein’s text. Such new
insights, made possible by adapting the scale and
focus of textual analysis, are exactly what Moretti
expects readers will earn by learning how not to read
texts—and, by extension, by learning how to use
different technologies to complement, and corroborate,
our readings of texts.
Experiments with distant reading challenge the truism
that readers make sense of a story by seizing upon
a narrative episode, using it as a key to gain entry
into the deeper meaning inherent within the text,
“as if meaning resided in a buried treasure chest or
behind a lock door” (Clement, 2008, p. 365). Clement
proposes a different metaphor for understanding
narrative structure, that of a map key, which instead
implies that readers make sense of stories by using
narrative structure as a guide. The metaphor of the
map key offers a view of reading complex narrative as a
process of orientation, through which readers manage
their awareness of a text’s meanings by acquainting
themselves with its structure.
Similar views of distant reading and complex narrative
inform the project of developing XML schemas for
encoding digitized versions of fictional narratives.
Undertaken as part of a larger study based out of the
University of British Columbia, this project investigates,
and proposes, methods of reading adapted to
contemporary print and digital fiction’s “shift away from
conventional narrative logic toward indeterminacy,
fragmentation, and open-endedness” (Dobson, 2008,
p. 1). While the goal of our larger study is the
development of new models for writing, reading, and
teaching complex print and digital narrative, the focus
here will be the use of XML to encode fictional
narratives as, in itself, a form of textual analysis,
involving both closeness and distance, and enabling
even further alterations, of the kind Moretti proposes,
to the scale and focus of scholarly reading practices.

3. Towards a Schema Design for Narrative
Encoding
This paper will discuss the iterative development and
use of a set of Extensible Markup Language (XML)
schemas for encoding digitized versions of fictional
narratives. Although the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI) Guidelines for Electronic Text Encoding and
Interchange define and document a thorough markup
language for encoding humanities texts, including
significant provisions for encoding scholarly editions of
drama, poetry, and manuscripts, there presently exist
only a handful of XML schemas designed specifically

for marking up literary fiction (e.g., StoryML, FicML,
PftML).
Drawing on principles and approaches from
narratology, our literary encoding schemas combine
TEI elements and attributes with tags that specifically
mark up elements of narrative structure, such
as actions, characters, dialogue, narration, objects,
places, and time. Examples of encoded short stories,
such as Alice Munro’s “The Love of a Good Woman”
and Ernest Hemingway’s “Hills Like White Elephants,”
will be used to demonstrate, and critique, the different
possibilities we have explored for developing literary
XML schemas.

4. From Envisaging to Visualization: Young
People’s Narrative Reading Practices
This paper will present findings of a study examining
the reading practices of young adults. The study
focused on the dialectic between how students
of literature envisage narrative and how they
actually visualize it in systematized approaches. Fifty
participants in grades 11 and 12 read Hemingway’s
“Hills Like White Elephants” and O’Faolain’s “The
Trout.” They then engaged in a series of activities:
evaluating form by physically “cutting and pasting” a
narrative’s text, sketching narrative diagrams, XML
tagging of narratives, and an exit interview.
Participants indicated that narratives were enjoyable
because their plots were “unexpected,” but also unenjoyable because they were “hard to understand.”
That is, comprehension of a narrative is a condition of
enjoyment and disappointment: narratives ought to be
original but not confusing. In XML tagging, grade 11
students were given a basic schema to tag a narrative
but were also encouraged to modify this schema.
The schemas were altered beyond a systematized
approach, instead revealing critical activity across
a range of “levels.” Globally, for example, subjects
modified the schemas beyond a “systematic” approach
in order to highlight salient features particular to a
text. Subjects added the tags setting and contradictory
statements to the XML schema for “Hills,” suggesting
a post-critical (and almost juridical) attitude. More
locally, there is evidence that tagging is dependent
on “spheres of lexical activity,” where tagging of
features depends on the immediate context in which
they occur. Furthermore, tagging appears to be not
only independent of syntax, but also independent of
the tagged-narrative’s grammar – subjects prescribe
systematic rules, but do not follow them.

5. PlotVis: Design and Implementation of Five
Plot Models
Our final panelists will discuss issues related to
designing and programming four different views of
narrative structure. In the first case, the user is able to
see a Fibonacci series where one of the encoded plot
elements is placed at the centre of the visualization,
and other elements are arranged out from the centre,
either sequentially as they appear in the text or else
hierarchically as they are arranged in the XML tree
(Figure 2).

Figure 2: This screenshot of Munro’s “Love of a Good Woman”
demonstrates the complexity of the tagging, with each coloured
cylinder representing one of roughly 7000 tagged pieces of text.

In this visualization, each piece of text appears as
a coloured cylinder. The height of the cylinders
can be associated with the length of the text they
contain. The second visualization privileges sequence
over centrality, with multiple pipelines representing
the characters or narrator, and changes to the
arrangement of the pipe showing where changes in
time occur (Figure 3).

Figure 3: Our design sketch for a view that
privileges sequence over centrality, with multiple
pipelines representing the characters or narrator.

44

The third visualization is based on an architectural
metaphor, where readers see the different kinds of
encoded plot elements as floors of a building (Figure
4).

Figure 4: Our design sketch of the
architectural concept of story visualization.

Text that occurs only within a single element tag fills a
space on a single floor, while text that spans multiple
elements appears as blocks that span the floors. Our
fourth and most recent design resembles in some
ways our sequential model, only in this case the text
is represented by vertical walls of text that bend at
locations where there are changes in time, while the
other encoded plot elements appear as colours on the
surfaces of the walls (Figure 5).

Figure 5: This screenshot shows the wall display.
Vertical coloured bands represent the encoded
text elements that are shown as nodes in Figure 2.

The visualization system was created using a popular
game engine, called Unity3D, which provides us with
a flexible platform for interaction with 3D objects,
primarily through writing Javascript. The contents of
the visualization, as indicated above, are produced
from XML-encoded text files.

As digital humanities scholars increase the
technological sophistication of their methodologies
and tool use to represent historical change, their
work becomes more theoretically complex from an
information and computer science perspective. While
much DH scholarship can be performed using offthe-shelf tools and simple data models, attempts
to model highly nuanced historical knowledge,
especially in event-based representation, requires
a greater theoretical investment. This panel will
present humanities scholars whose work focuses
on using graph and semi-graph data models that
track historical change as events in different parts
of the digital scholarly media ecosystem—from the
theoretical layout of the data and the representation
of historical fact to the creation and population
of a data structure to the analysis, representation
and interaction with the product—in a dialectic with
computer scientists and information scientists who
have grappled with the problems of designing robust
45

Digital Humanities 2011

models and implementing performant technology in
this domain. Through analysis of the digital scholarly
media process from theory to creation to review, we
hope to reveal sophisticated practical and theoretical
solutions for representing, creating and reviewing
historical knowledge.
The panel will be chaired by Elijah Meeks and allow
for a short presentation by each of the discussants
on the topics described below. This will be followed
by a roundtable-style discussion with media examples
from each discussant's work cued up so that, if the
conversation focuses on one of these works, it can
then be demonstrated and examined in detail. The
guiding themes of the panel are theoretical challenges
of event-based historical models, practical issues in
creating sophisticated digital scholarly media using
such models, and methods to review the models and
the media created from them.
The panel presents a continuum of scholars
from the humanities through information science
to computer science, with Elijah Meeks (Digital
Humanities Specialist, Stanford University) and Ruth
Mostern (Associate Professor of History, University
of California, Merced) representing the traditional
humanities scholars. Elijah Meeks will speak about
his work transitioning the Mapping the Republic of
Letters database into a pure graph model and the
challenges and benefits that this representation of
historical knowledge presents in contrast to traditional
relational databases as well as the suitability of graph
data for event modeling. Ruth Mostern will focus on
the role of event modeling in her current Yellow River
research, tracking the linkages between historical
environmental change and socio-political change, with
an emphasis on the temporal and spatial reconciliation
of differing scales and emphases of data, specifically
comparing historical data collected for environmental
science and traditional textual sources for tracking
political and social change over time and space.
Karl Grossner (Geography, University of California,
Santa Barbara) and Ryan Shaw (Assistant Professor
of Information and Library Science, University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill) are both information scientists
whose work has focused on issues critical to historical
narrative modeling: ontologies and periodization.
Ryan Shaw will speak to the complexities of event
representation, focusing on periods and events as
not only existing in the past, but also produced
by discourse about the past, and the need for an
approach to representation in which we can move
back and forth between treating periods and events
as, on the one hand, shared intersubjective points
of reference and, on the other, unique perspectives
46

on the past articulated through narrative techniques.
Karl Grossner will discuss his work developing a
spatial history ontology in which historical processes
are modeled as theories of event relations, as well as
its implementation in a PostgreSQL spatial database
able to support mapping, analytical applications and
representations of narrative.
Finally, Ramesh Jain (University of California, Irvine)
and Vitit Kantabutra (Idaho State University) will
discuss the practical issues of implementing such
theoretical constructs in software. Vitit Kantabutra will
spend some time explaining his work with Jack Owens
fleshing out the Intentionally Linked Entity model,
which is a generalized graph data model with a wide
range of applications, and is especially suitable for
the representation of historical and spatiotemporal
events. Ramesh Jain will engage with the processing
of event-based data semantically, both through typical
searches and by exploring the emergent attributes of
the database as an object itself.
By presenting a continuum of academic specialties
that are unified in their focus on sophisticated digital
representation of historical knowledge, we feel this
panel will provide useful practical and theoretical value
to the Digital Humanities community. We also hope
to add to the growing discussion of how to judge the
quality of the media produced in these endeavors, not
only from the perspective of humanist scholars but
from scholars in the field of information science and
computer science.

forms of mass distinction through their purchases
and reviews. My project argues that these traces of
popular reading choices constitute a fresh perspective
on elusive audience reactions to literature, one that
reveals distinct networks of conversation that are
transforming previously well-understood relationships
between writers and their readers, between the art of
fiction and the market for books (Radway). Employing
network analysis methodologies and ‘distant reading’
of book reviews, recommendations and other digital
traces of cultural distinction (Moretti), my research
develops new models for studying literary culture in
America today. In this paper I consider the reception of
three mid-career writers, David Foster Wallace, Junot
Díaz and Colson Whitehead, asking how they have
redefined authorial expectations and literary identity
through their work.

2. Background
Overview: Our panel proposal, and the three individual
papers, present work in progress at the Stanford
Literary Lab, a work space opened in the Fall of
2010 where faculty and students conduct research
of a digital and quantitative nature. Ideally, we try
to generate critical “experiments” that mix archival
exploration and hypothesis testing, and extend over
a period of one-two years; all of them collaborative,
and developing through regular group meetings that
evaluate results and plan the work to come.

PAPER 1

Reading, Writing and
Reputation: Literary Networks in
Contemporary American Fiction
Finn, Ed

edfinn@stanford.edu
Stanford University

My project is founded on the argument that as literary
production evolves, new kinds of reading communities
and collaborative cultural entities are emerging. Many
of these communities are ephemeral and quite often
they are fostered by commercial interests seeking to
capitalize on their cultural production. Nevertheless, a
handful of websites like Amazon continue to dominate
the marketplace for books and attract millions of
customer reviews, ratings and purchase decisions,
and the literary ecologies of these book reviews have
become valuable research resources. The ideational
networks I explore are made up of books, authors,
characters and other literary entities (these are the
nodes), along with the references linking them together
as collocations in book reviews, suggestions from
recommendation engines, and other structures of
connection. As my project has moved from Thomas
Pynchon and Toni Morrison to the younger generation
represented by Wallace, Díaz and Whitehead, I have
improved my data-gathering and network analysis
methodologies. With new data and better tools, I
hope to determine how the game of authorial fame
is changing in an increasingly reflexive, networked
literary landscape.

3. Proposal
1. Overview
Long-established models of literary production are
changing dramatically as the digital era continues
to blur, and at times erase, the divisions between
authors, critics and readers. Millions of cultural
consumers are now empowered to participate in
previously closed literary conversations and to express

This paper will present my research on three younger
writers who have broken new ground in literary
constructions of identity in a shifting landscape
of reception. Wallace, Díaz and Whitehead, all
members of “Generation X,” are writers who have
captured national attention through particularities of
self-presentation and novelistic style.

47

Digital Humanities 2011

I argue that these authors signal a sea change in
literary reputation. Authors as well as publishers are
now interacting with active communities of readers who
conduct complex cultural conversations independent
of traditional arbiters of taste. As the barriers
separating readers from ordained critics crumble
online, younger authors are increasingly engaging
with audiences that are both collaborative and vocal.
Tracing the half-spun career arcs of Wallace, Díaz
and Whitehead, this paper articulates a new model
of contemporary literary culture: a reading society
that demands increasing authorial reflexivity to mirror
the collaborative, iterative nature of digital literary
conversations.
Each author makes a distinct form of literary identity
central to his work. David Foster Wallace defined
a deeply introspective and reflexive narrative voice,
pioneering a style so individual that he ultimately felt it
had become clichéd and struggled to escape it in his
final years of writing. In his breakout novel The Brief,
Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Díaz has tackled
the challenges of his hybrid Dominican/American
identity by creating a new argot of Spanglish phrases,
pop cultural references and an ingenious deployment
of footnotes to both buttress and undermine normative
American understandings of Latin American history
and culture. Finally, Colson Whitehead has similarly
inverted expectations for African American authors,
accomplishing the seemingly impossible feat of writing
in the traditions of both Toni Morrison and Thomas
Pynchon. As a group, these writers have little in
common except their age, positions of cultural prestige
and their talents as re-inventors of literary identity.
This makes them excellent subjects for a study of
contemporary literary reception and the collective
construction of literary identities.

4. Methodology
The project draws on two primary datasets: first,
a corpus of professional and consumer book
reviews collected from nationally prestigious reviewing
newspapers and magazines along with consumer
reviews from Amazon dating back to 1996; second,
networks of recommendations based on consumer
purchases and book ownership drawn from the
websites Amazon and LibraryThing. Comparing these
different literary networks allows me to make broader
arguments about contemporary authorial fame and
the changing role of the everyday reader in literary
conversations.
For the first dataset, consumer and professional book
reviews, I have employed the MorphAdorner project’s

48

Named Entity Recognition tool to create a dictionary
of literary proper nouns (authors, titles, character
names, etc). This dictionary was used to identify
collocations on a paragraph level throughout these
reviews, making nouns into nodes and collocations into
links. This approach allows me to empirically identify
and visualize those authors and texts frequently
mentioned in the same review contexts. The resulting
noun networks reveal not only the distinctions between
everyday readers and more traditional arbiters of
literary taste but the ways in which popular authors
are increasingly carrying on multiple independent and
complex literary conversations.
The second dataset combines book recommendations
provided by Amazon’s “Customers who bought
this also bought” engine and LibraryThing’s
recommendation engine. In this case books form the
nodes and recommendations the links connecting
them. Employing network analysis to identify patterns
of prestige and clustering in these recommendation
networks has allowed me to trace the diverse functions
of genre and authorial identity in ordering literary texts
and to identify the basic rules of contemporary market
canonicity.

5. Conclusion
As I have moved this project through its first two case
studies, with Pynchon and Morrison, I have refined a
hybrid methodology that explores literary and cultural
context through a limited empirical lens, considering
particular digital and textual networks of reference
and evaluation. This iteration of the process takes on
three authors with very different styles to ask how a
younger literary generation is working together with
newly empowered readers to construct new kinds
of multiply mediated, widely collaborative forms of
cultural identity. By studying these writers mid-career,
I hope to trace both the evolution of contemporary
authorial fame and its relationship to wider systems of
social distinction in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

PAPER 2

Paper Two: Plot as Network:
Quantifying the Evolution of
Dramatic Style
Lewis, Rhiannon

rmlewis@stanford.edu
Stanford University

In the last decade or so, quantitative evidence has
become part of literary study in a variety of ways
– from the material realities of book history [library
holdings, or translation flows], to the linguistic macropatterns that have renewed the study of attribution,
genre differentiation, and stylistics. Plot, however, has
proved much more difficult to quantify. This paper
looks for a possible solution in network theory, whose
concepts re-define plot as a system where characters
are the vertices, and their interactions the edges of
a narrative network. Focusing, for now, on dramatic
literature, such "network narratology" brings to light
the striking discontinuities between the structure of
ancient and Renaissance tragedy, and suggests a
reconceptualization of literary characters in terms of
their "connectedness" and their position within the
network.
This paper grew out of Franco Moretti’s network
analysis of three Shakespeare plays: Hamlet,
Macbeth, and King Lear. Preliminary work for the
project included php-extraction of speaker-receiver
data from MIT’s xml-encoded Shakespeare corpus.
The program R was then used to generate network
analyses. A team of Stanford graduate students handcorrected receiver attributions to a level of 100%
accuracy. The paper’s methodological component
discusses the difficulties of automated recipient

attribution in dramatic texts, and touches on issues
of “quantifying” performance literature, including plays
lacking an authoritative text. The idea of (performance)
time turned into space is grounded in narrative
theory: specifically, Alex Woloch’s concept of a
character-system made of many character-spaces
(The One vs. the Many). In addition to modeling “plot
as network” based in dialogue, I also utilize stage
directions to map networks as shared “space.” Here,
space includes more ambiguous character presence
such as disguised identity and plays-within-plays, as
well as the auditory presence of eavesdropping. Thus,
overlapping networks of character position -- both
physical and verbal -- model multiple dimensions of
plot through form and performance.
The paper draws on extant and original corpora of over
70 plays, from classical through Renaissance drama.
They include Shakespeare’s complete dramatic works,
as well as select plays by Marlowe, Jonson,
and Webster. The classical plays are drawn from
Project Perseus’ database. Evaluating our script’s
performance across literary periods has revealed that
classical dramatic dialogue follows a linear progression
more frequently than dialogue in Renaissance drama.
In other words, the script always assumes that Speaker
A will address Speaker B who addresses Speaker C,
etc, and therefore inaccurately assigns the receiver
when Speaker B responds back to Speaker A. Here,
methodology illuminates dramatic structure. The linear
model of “progressive” dialogue correctly attributes a
higher percentage of utterances (and words) in Greek
than Shakespearean tragedy. Dialogue in ancient
plays more strictly observes a recursive model that
occurs less frequently within Shakespeare’s more
populated scenes. The script correctly identifies more
receiver tags in plays with smaller casts (i.e., classical
drama) and scenes with two interlocutors, such as
Iago and Roderigo in Othello I.i. When there are
more than two interlocutors, the script misattributes
a response to a previous speaker as an address to
the following speaker. However, accuracy is usually
measured at the unit of the utterance, or speech-tag.
When measuring accuracy by words, Act I of Othello
presents a different case. Word-based accuracy is
consistently lower than utterance-based accuracy in
the Greek plays and in Hamlet, but in Othello, the
reverse is true. Thus, inaccurately attributed speeches
—those given in response to a preceding speech-are longer in Hamlet and the Greek plays than in
the opening act of Othello. It follows that in Othello,
characters tend to say more when they address the
next character who speaks. If there's more chain-like
dialogic progress in Act I of Othello than in all of
Hamlet, this corroborates scene-based thematics that
49

Digital Humanities 2011

characterize Othello: its beginning in medias res and
the transmission of news through increasingly public
scenes (from “a street” (I.i) to “another street” (I.ii) to
“a council-chamber” (I.iii)). In the second section of this
paper I explore such network patterns diachronically:
at levels of scene, act and play, and in comparative
context.
This formal figuration of dialogue’s progress
supplements the paper’s central findings: weighted
network visuals, at levels of the play entire, act
and scene. At the most macroscopic level, we
observe “synchronic” patterns and discontinuities: for
example, larger scenes, with more characters and
therefore usually a more “public” nature occur near the
beginning and the ending of Hamlet, Lear, and Othello.
Networks create a hierarchy of centrality among
characters. This model inevitably calls into question the
binaries with which we usually think about characters:
protagonist vs. minor characters, or "round" vs. "flat":
nothing here supports these dichotomies, and, in fact,
the hierarchical re-conceptualization of characters is
another promising research area opened by network
theory.
The third section focuses not on character as
determined by location in narrative structure, but by
semantic analysis of dialogue, using word frequency
and semantic field analysis. For example, relativized
word frequency lists reveal that “Cassio” is among
the top ten most frequent words that Brabantio, the
Duke, Lodovico and Montano speak, before any other
character’s name, including “Othello,” “Desdemona,”
or “Iago.” This semantic analysis detects the linguistic
virulence of Iago’s revenge scheme, “promoting”
Cassio’s name in the constructed adultery plot.
Semantic analysis and weighted word networks also
reveal that antagonists’ confrontations are consistently
verbose in Greek tragedy, while Shakespearean
antagonists may never exchange a word. In this paper,
I consider dramatic plot as a function of network
connections--coded as relations between speaker
and addressee—through both historical and generic
developments.

PAPER 3

Social Connections and Space
in Nineteenth-Century Rio de
Janeiro
Frank, Zephyr

zfrank@stanford.edu
Stanford University

This paper explores the theme of social connections
in the novels of Machado de Assis, José de Alencar,
and Aluísio Azevedo against a background of empirical
research on historical social networks in the space
of the city of Rio de Janeiro. It argues that a
better understanding of the meaning and configuration
of social networks in history can be obtained
through creative use of literary sources. In this, the
paper builds upon the work of Antonio Candido,
Roberto Schwarz, and Raymundo Faoro—all of whom
emphasized the historical and sociological richness
in the works of the novelists under consideration. By
emphasizing the physical space of the city, its street
networks and modes of transport, and the existence
of overlapping social networks therein, the paper
connects sociologically inflected literary criticism to
social history through the use of new digital methods
of analysis and visualization.
The body of the paper is divided into two parts. The
first part analyzes networks within the novels and the
novelistic space of the city. The second part, building

Digital Humanities 2011

on the network typologies and spaces discovered in
the analysis of the novels, explores social networks
and the space of the city through the analysis of
historical documents such as lists of club members
or occupational groupings. The paper then concludes
with an appraisal of the way literary networks and
spaces can inform better historical questions put to
more traditional historical documents.
In terms of digital humanities methods, the paper
explores the use of computational techniques and
programs such as GIS (ArcGIS and related software)
and Gephi, a network analysis tool. Part of the novelty
of the approach considered in this paper is the degree
to which it combines analysis across these platforms
—that is, network space (Gephi) and geographical
space (ArcGIS) taken together. Because it is difficult
to describe the approach taken in the paper in words
alone, two examples of the kinds of visualization
generated for the paper are shown to the right.

Sonhos d’Ouro

José de Alencar’s novel (1872) is told in a traditional
third-person style. The central character (red node)
is surrounded by characters of similar importance
(measured by network centrality). There are relatively
few network clusters and far fewer characters and
complications than in the case of Machado’s novel.
The plot of Alencar’s novel seeks to resolve the tension
between newly minted capitalist wealth and values of
thrift and honor embodied in the protagonist.

Epitaph of a Small Winner

Machado de Assis’s novel (1881) is told in the first
person by a voluble narrator. Connections to the
central character (red node) shoot off in multiple
directions as the book zig-zags through his life (which
can be read, loosely, as a Bildungsroman of Brazil
personified in the character of Brás Cubas). The
structure of the novel thereby reflects the author’s
critique of the capricious and fragmented world of Rio
de Janeiro. Still, in the midst of all this fragmentation,
certain characters and places emerge as brokers and
spaces of social connections.

The second part of the paper explores what happens
when we place historical individuals in the context
of social networks and the spaces of the city. Using
information gleaned from the analysis of networks in
novels, including the role of “brokers” and “spaces
of interaction,” part two looks for evidence of similar
patterns of social connections and spaces in the
historical record.
As in the example provided in the diagram above, it
is possible to reconstruct the shape of social networks
in nineteenth-century Rio de Janeiro through the
collection of data concerning club and organization
51

Digital Humanities 2011

membership and the analysis of large datasets with
tools such as Gephi and Pajek (used above). There
is a clear pecking order in the organizations of the
civic fauna in Rio. Just a few leaders are required,
for example, to tie together 90 percent of the civic
fauna in first- or second-degree connections. The
same emphasis on hierarchy and gatekeeping with
respect to social connections appears in the analysis
of the novels discussed with respect to the first part of
the paper.

2. Panel Abstract
This is a panel session proposed by six established
non-tenure-track practitioners and scholars of the
digital humanities. Several of us are among the
contributors to a forthcoming open-access essay
collection on the place of "alternative academics"
within the academy. Our goal is to open a discussion
of issues from that collection, and from a related NEHfunded workshop on career paths in DH centers, that
are relevant to the lives of digital humanists working
outside the professoriate.
The "#alt-ac" project, to be published in 2011
(online, for comment and extension) by NYU's
MediaCommons, features contributions by and for
scholars with deep training and experience in the
humanities, who are working or seeking employment
— off the tenure track — within universities and
colleges, or in allied knowledge and cultural heritage
institutions such as museums, libraries, academic
presses, historical societies, and governmental
humanities organizations. For reasons ranging from
the professional, intellectual, or institutional to the
deeply personal, an increasing number of these
people identify themselves as members of the digital
humanities community.
The work of academic and cultural heritage institutions
has long been enriched and enabled by humanities
scholars, developers, and administrators like us.
Regardless of institutional status, digital humanists
maintain sophisticated research, publication, and
production profiles and bring methodological and
theoretical training to bear on problem-sets of
great importance to traditional humanities disciplines
and to the scholars who operate within them.
However, class divisions between faculty and staff in

higher education are profound, and the suspicion or
(worse) condescension with which so- called 'failed
academics' are sometimes met can be disheartening.
Working, as we are often perceived to do, on the
margins of C. P. Snow's "two cultures" (or, less
polemically, at the interstices of libraries or DH
centers and academic departments) digital humanities
practitioners are sometimes placed well outside more
easily-classified and socially-supported areas of the
academic enterprise.
For all that, non-tenure-track digital humanists
love their work. Many people navigating ill-defined
alternative academic career paths speak compellingly
about the satisfaction of making teams (and systems,
and programs) work, of solving problems and
personally making or enabling breakthroughs in
research and scholarship in their disciplines, and
of contributing to and experiencing the life of the
mind in ways they did not imagine when they
entered graduate school. Essays in our #alt-ac
collection range from personal narratives, positioned
within certain academic disciplines and institutions,
to staged dialogues on opportunities and pitfalls off
the tenure track, to reflective and data-driven essays
on the state of academic digital humanities and
the (problematic? disruptive? salutary?) position of
"alternative academics" within it. A few contributors
also illustrate retrograde career paths or offer critiques
of the #alt-ac concept. Conversations stemming from
the MediaCommons project have sparked a number of
other collaborations, such as MITH's "Off the Tracks,"
an NEH workshop on institutional practices in "laying
new lines for digital humanities scholars" — preliminary
recommendations from which will be presented here.
The six speakers on our proposed panel will offer 7minute summaries of their research or make position
statements based on their published essays, before
opening discussion amongst themselves and with the
DH conference audience.
Briefly, the panelists include:
Dr. Bethany Nowviskie of the University of Virginia,
who will also moderate the discussion. Nowviskie, who
speaks and writes frequently on alternative academic
careers in the digital humanities, is the editor of the
forthcoming MediaCommons collection. She will frame
this panel's discussion with an overview of concepts
relevant to the digital humanities that have emerged
in all contributed essays and dialogues and will reflect
on some issues crucial to DH — such as intellectual
freedom and policies related to open source and
intellectual property — that were note foregrounded as
clearly in the collection as one might expect.
53

Digital Humanities 2011

Dr. Julia Flanders of Brown University. Flanders will
speak to issues raised by her dissertation on the
politics of labor in the digital humanities and her #alt-ac
essay, "You work at Brown — What do you Teach?,"
which examines the pragmatic and psychological
effects of divergent practices in accounting for time
and labor in knowledge work. How do we think of —
and reward — time and effort differently when laborers
on very similar projects may alternately be classified
as adjunct, tenured, or tenure-track faculty, salaried
staff, hourly wage employees, student apprentices and
fellowship winners, and post-docs or research staff?
What are the implications for our institutions and our
digital humanities workforce?
Dr. Tanya Clement of the University of Maryland,
College Park. Clement will describe the genesis,
process, and outcomes of a two-day NEH workshop
held at MITH, the Maryland Institute for Technology in
the Humanities, in January of 2011. "Off the Tracks:
Laying New Lines for Digital Humanties Scholars" will
examine best practices across a number of differentlyconstituted digital humanities labs and centers, with
the goal of articulating reasonable career trajectories
and professional development opportunities for hybrid
academics and scholar-programmers — employees
who are not well served by a normative division
between "research" usually associated with faculty
positions and "service" usually associated with staff
roles.
Dr. Doug Reside of the New York Public Library.
Reside, formerly a "scholar-programmer" at MITH,
is Clement's partner in the NEH workshop. His
presentation will be informed by that experience
and their collaborative drafting of a white paper
based on the workshop, but he will also speak to
the themes of his #alt-ac essay, "Of Ant-Lions and
Scholar-Programmers." Here, he argues that — of
several imperfect options for satisfying the two (unified
but sometimes contradictory) natures of the digital
humanities software developer, a well-defined position
in a digital humanities center holds the most promise.
Dot Porter, MLIS of the University of Indiana. As a
distinguished member of the DH community and the
only panelist not holding a doctorate in the humanities,
Porter will speak to the issue of "credential creep" in
the digital humanities job market. Her #alt-ac essay,
co-authored with Amanda Gailey of the University
of Nebraska, likens the frequency with which DH
jobs are now advertised as requiring a doctorate
to the conditions described in William James's
1903 essay, The PhD Octopus. Gailey and Porter
examine increasingly stringent job pre-requisites and
what they term the "creeping Ivy" of elitism in the
54

context of traditional spirits of entrepreneurship and
egalitarianism in the digital humanities. Porter will
conclude by offering clear recommendations to DH
hiring committees.
Dr. Eric Rochester of the University of Virginia. After
getting a PhD in English from the University of Georgia,
Rochester worked as a computational linguist and
programmer for a number of technology firms. He
joined the Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia
Library as senior software developer in 2011. His
presentation, “There and Back Again,” will discuss
transitioning between industry and academia, and how
to manage and ease that process for both the individual
and the institution.
All six speakers have enthusiastically committed to
attend and present at DH in Stanford. We recognize
that the presence of "alternative" academic career
paths is long-established in the digital humanities —
if in generally ad-hoc ways — and will not argue that
our roles and observations are fundamentally new.
However, we feel strongly that this conference — with
its focus on the "big tent" of the digital humanities, and
occurring at a time when humanities graduate students
are faced with the worst tenure-track job market in
memory — is the right moment for a sustained and
critical discussion of the opportunities and challenges
of DH career-seekers off the straight and narrow path
to tenure.

This session will present an interim report on the
findings and a demonstration of the Social Networks
and Archival Context (SNAC) project.
SNAC is exploring the feasibility of using existing
archival descriptions to create a prototype sociohistorical resource and resource discovery tool that
will enhance access to and understanding of cultural
resources in archives, libraries, and museums.
Beginning in May 2010, with funding from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the two-year project is
using advanced technology in three primary ways: to
derive descriptions of people from descriptions of their
records; to match and merge the derived records with
library and museum authority records; and to build a
prototype socio-historical resource and access system
use the resulting matched and combined records.

social and professional relations among named entities
and to interrelate (or link) the related records with
one another. The resulting EAC-CPF records are
matched against one another and against several
million authority records represented in the Library
of Congress Name Authority File (NACO/LCNAF),
the Getty Vocabulary Program's Union List of Artist
Names (ULAN), and the Virtual International Authority
File (VIAF), a collaboration between several national
libraries. Unique data in matching records is being
merged or combined into a single EAC-CPF record,
with the ultimate goal of having one record for each
unique person, corporate body, for family. Finally, the
project is developing a prototype public access and
historical resource system based on the unique EACCPF records created from the processing.
SNAC is a collaboration between three institutions: the
Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities
(IATH), University of Virginia; the California Digital
Library (CDL), University of California; and the School
of Information, University of California, Berkeley (SI/
UCB). IATH is the lead institution and is responsible for
overall project management and for deriving EAC-CPF
records from EAD-encoded finding aids. SI/UCB is
responsible for the matching and merging of authority
records. CDL is responsible for developing a prototype
public access and historical resource system based on
the data produced by the other two partners.
The three papers presented in the session will
cover the following topics: A comprehensive overview
of SNAC and a detailed description of the
derivation processing; a description of the theoretical
and application challenges of matching data from
heterogeneous sources; and a description of the
methods and technology being adapted or developed
to create the prototype public system. Finally, the
session will present a brief demonstration of the
prototype system.

Leveraging the new standard Encoded Archival
Context–Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families
(EAC-CPF), the project is deriving EAC-CPF records
from nearly 30,000 EAD-encoded finding aids made
available to the project by the Library of Congress and
three archival consortia: Online Archive of California;
Northwest Digital Archive; and Virginia Heritage.
Names of record creators and of people documented in
the records and record descriptions are being used to
create EAC-CPF records. Co-occurrence of names in
finding aids is also being recorded in order to document

PAPER 1

Overview and Methods
Pitti, Daniel

dpitti@Virginia.edu

University of Virginia

1. Introduction
Archivists have a long history of describing the
people who—acting individually, in families, or
in formally organized groups—create and are
documented in archival records. They research
and describe the artists, scholars, political leaders,
scientists, government agencies, soldiers, universities,
businesses, families, and others who create and are
represented in the items that are now part of our
shared cultural legacy. However, because archivists
have traditionally described records and the people
documented in them in a single apparatus, the finding
aid, this biographical-historical information is tied to
specific resources and institutions. Currently there is
no system in place that aggregates these descriptions
of individual persons, families, and corporate bodies,
and interrelates them to reveal the professional and
social relations that existed among the described
entities.
Leveraging the new standard Encoded Archival
Context–Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families
(EAC-CPF), the Social Networks and Archival Context
(SNAC) project is exploring the feasibility of using
existing archival descriptions in new ways in order
to enhance access to and understanding of cultural
resources in archives, libraries, and museums.
Beginning in May 2010, with funding from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the two-year project
is using advanced technology to derive descriptions of
people from descriptions of their records, to match and
merge the derived records with library and museum
authority records, and use the resulting records to
build a prototype socio-historical resource and access
system.

2. Data and Data Contributing Institutions
Over 28,000 EAD-encoded finding aids have been
made available to the project by the Library of
Congress (918+) and three archival consortia: the
Online Archive of California (13,932+); Northwest
56

Digital Archive (5,160+), and Virginia Heritage
(8,390+). The three consortia represent findings from
over 200 individual repositories.
A key criterion in selecting the finding aid sources was
geographical proximity. Because archives commonly
emphasize local history, it is surmised that the
geographic proximity of the archives would yield
a higher rate of co-referencing (for example, a
correspondent in one finding aid is the creator in
another), and thus provide corroborating evidence of
social-professional relations. Another very important
consideration was encoding consistency, and thus the
project emphasized consortia with high quality control
standards.
Three institutions are contributing authority records
that will be matched and merged with the derived
EAC-CPF records. The Library of Congress has made
the NACO/Library of Congress Name Authority File
(LCNAF) available for project use (3.8M personal and
900K corporate name records). The Getty Vocabulary
Program has contributed the Union List of Artist Names
(ULAN) (293K personal and corporate names). Finally,
OCLC Research has made available the subset of
the Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) that
intersects with the LCNAF available to the project. The
VIAF, for now, only contains personal names.

3. Separating Description of People from
Description of Records
There are several interrelated intellectual and practical
rationales for separating the descriptions of people
from the description of the records that document
their lives. These rationales are based on archival
processing efficiencies, the intellectual quality and
depth of resource description, and enhanced access to
primary humanities resources for all users.
Cooperative Authority Control. Authority control
is labor-intensive, and sharing the creation,
maintenance, and use of authority data improves
catalogers’ productivity. Sharing descriptions of
creators and people and organizations documented in
archival records saves time and labor.
Integrated Access to and Context for Cultural
Heritage. Integrated, union access to archival authority
records can be used to locate and identify people,
organizations, and families, and these records in turn
can lead to cultural heritage resources through links
to descriptions or dynamically generated searches
of catalogs. An archival authority record can provide
not just contextual information for understanding
archival resources, but also access to and context for

Digital Humanities 2011

understanding all that constitutes the human record
and our cultural heritage.
Biographical/Historical Resource. In addition to name
control, archival authority records provide biographical/
historical data about the creator, such as when
and where the creator existed, significant activities
and functions performed by the creator, and other
significant dates, places, and events. This historical
information can be used as an independent resource
that can assist users in identifying and learning about
the described entity.
Social/Historical Context. People live and work with
other people, both as individuals and as members
of families and organizations. These social and
professional relations are reflected in records created
by them and consequently in the descriptions of the
records. Archival authority control records provide
a potential means to systematically gather and
document these social and professional relations
in links that interrelate descriptions of people,
organizations, and families. This documentation can
provide convenient access to the broad socialhistorical contexts within which corporate bodies,
persons, and families were active, and convenient,
navigable access to related or complementary
resources.

4. Methods and Processing Overview
There are three ways in which technology is being
used in the SNAC Project. First, using Extensible
Markup Language–Transformation (XSLT), the project
is deriving EAC-CPF records from EAD-encoded
finding aids for record creators and people referenced
in the description 1. Initially the project is focusing
on extracting names, biographical-historical data,
occupations, dates of existence, and languages used
that are clearly and specifically encoded in the finding
aids. Later in the project, natural language processing
techniques will be used to experiment with extracting
names and other targeted descriptive data that appear
in the description but that are not encoded specifically.
Second, the extracted EAC-CPF records are being
matched against one another and against NACO/
Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)
records, Union List of Artist Names (ULAN) authority
records, and finally Virtual International Authority File
(VIAF) aggregated authority records. Unique data
in matching records is being merged or combined
into a single EAC-CPF record. Finally, the project
is developing a prototype public access and sociohistorical resource system based on the collection of
unique EAC-CPF records created and interrelated.

This paper will address the first step in the processing,
deriving EAC-CPF records from archival finding aids.
The matching and merging and development of the
prototype system will be addressed in separate papers.

5. Deriving EAC-CPF Records
The principal technologies involved in the derivation
process are XSLT 2.0 and XPath 2.0, with
relatively heavy use of regular expressions and
customized functions. Initially in the project, the
focus is on identifying and deriving individual
records from the following EAD tag components:
<persname>, <corpname>, and <famname> that
occur within <origination>, <controlaccess>, and
<unittitle>. Personal, corporate, and family names
derived from <origination> and <controlaccess> are
generally formulated according to strict cataloging
rules (AACR2, for American archives and libraries),
though challenges are presented by names that are
poorly formulated (for example, in direct rather than
inverted order, and intermixed with non-name data,
subject subdivisions or uniform titles). While many
names occurring within <unittitle> are tagged as such,
many occur without being tagged as names. The
tagged names found in <unittitle>, like those found
in <controlaccess>, are irregularly formatted. Regular
customized functions and named templates, many
incorporating the use of regular expressions, are used
to isolate and normalize the name strings, and to create
unique lists of names.
For each unique name string found, an EACCPF record is created. For records derived for
creators, additional descriptive data for dates of
existence, occupation, subject headings assigned to
records, languages used, and biographical-historical
information is extracted into the corresponding EACCPF records. Additionally, all unique referenced
names are related to the EAC-CPF record for the
creator, and for each an EAC-CPF record is also
created, and related to the record for the creator.
Because of co-referencing among finding aids (for
example, the same person corresponded with two
more record creators), the resulting set of records
derived from any set of finding aids contains more
than one EAC-CPF record describing the same entity.
Thus while duplicate entries are not created for named
entities found in a particular finding aid, duplicate or,
more accurately, matching records are created in the
processing of all of the finding aids.

6. Conclusion
While SNAC has only been underway for five months,
the Library of Congress, Online Archive of California,
and Northwest Digital Archive finding aids have
been processed to derive nearly 160,000 EAC-CPF
records. The matching and merging processing at SI/
UCB began in September 2010, after several weeks
devoted to acquiring and indexing several million VIAF,
ULAN, and LCNAF authority records in preparation
for the matching and merging processing. The initial
release of the prototype public historical resource and
access system was in December 2011. Though many
challenges remain, the early results suggest that the
data and the methods and techniques being applied
are highly effective. The deriving, and matching and
merging processing will continue to be refined, and the
prototype public system will continue to be refined and
new features developed.
Notes
1. The co-occurrence of names in the description of a single
collection documents either a social-professional or intellectual
relation between the named entities. Some occurrences can
specifically be identified as correspondents, thus confirming a
social-professional relation.

Records

1. Introduction
Our interests in cultural heritage, history, and the social
sciences are fundamentally about human activities.
Understanding the circumstances of people’s actions
—who, what, when, how, and why—illuminates their
lives and the events that they experienced. While
much information of interest to scholars is already
available in the collections of cultural institutions
58

such as archives and libraries, there is a significant
gap in the information infrastructure for dealing
with information about people. Standards for the
computerized handling people’s names have been
developed in libraries (such as MARC Authorities).
With the development of the EAC-CPF (Encoded
Archival Context–Corporate Bodies, Persons, and
Families) standard, a similar capability is just now
becoming available to archival collections. The Social
Networks and Archival Collections (SNAC) project
aims to start bridging that gap and to connect the
information about corporate bodies, persons and
families in the library world with those entities in the
archival world.
This paper reports on current experiments in matching
and merging entities in collections of EAC-CPF records
with those in library authority files and other sources.
EAC-CPF records represent the entities (which can
be individuals or groups of individuals) mentioned
in archival description records and can be derived
from the EAD (Encoded Archival Description) records
that encode description of archival collections. EAD
records, created by archivists and librarians, serve
as vital finding aids. Information on entities in these
records is an invaluable reference for humanities
scholars, particularly since entities may be referenced
and represented in multiple archival descriptions.
EAC-CPF records encode extensive information about
an entity, drawn from various parts of the source
records. In addition to basic identifying information
(name, type, occupation(s), and existence dates), they
include an entity’s relationship(s) with other entities,
resources, and works. Since EAC-CPF records are
derived independently from each EAD record, there
can be multiple records representing the same entity
in multiple EAD collections. A key problem, then, is
to identify multiple EAC-CPF records that represent
the same entity and merge them together into a single
record.
SNAC has been given an extensive collection of
library Name Authority records, including the Library
of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF), the
Virtual International Authority File (VIAF) from OCLC
Research, and the Union List of Artists Names
(ULAN) from the Getty Vocabulary Program. The
VIAF database combines name authority files from a
number of libraries worldwide, including the Library
of Congress, La Bibliothèque nationale de France,
Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, and the Vatican Library.
SNAC’s current implementations use either an exact
string match criteria or the alternate name information
from the name authority files to match entities in the
EAC-CPF collection.

Digital Humanities 2011

2. Related Work
Our problem is similar to the well-studied entity
name disambiguation problem, where the task is to
identify the correct entity, under a given context,
from a set of seemingly identical entities. Standard
approaches use statistical learning techniques, either
performing supervised learning and train classifiers
that predict the relevance of an entity given a
context or performing unsupervised learning and
design clustering techniques that cluster similar
entities together. As an example of the former,
Bunescu and Pasca (Bunescu and Pasca, 2006)
suggest a method that trains Support Vector Machines
(SVM) classifiers to disambiguate entities using the
Wikipedia corpus. The classifier was trained using
features extracted from the title, hyperlinks linking
other entities, categories assigned to the entity
and Wikipedia’s redirect and disambiguate pages.
Bagga and Baldwin (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998)
and Mann and Yarowsky (Mann and Yarowsky,
2003) are examples of the latter technique, where
similar entities are clustered using features extracted
from entity’s biographical information, words from
sentences surrounding the entity in texts and entity’s
social network and relationships. Other techniques
involve using gazetteers and name authority files
as external references to aid the disambiguation
process. Smith and Crane (Smith and Crane, 2001), for
example, use gazetteers to disambiguate geographic
place names.
SNAC’s focus is more precisely a clustering problem
rather than a classification problem, since we want
to group, in an unsupervised way, EAC-CPF records
belonging to the same entity. While some of the work
mentioned above uses sophisticated techniques to
discover entities in the text, the EAC-CPF standard
provides direct access to the name and other
information about the entity. This, combined with the
availability of the name authority files, allows use of
simpler algorithms based on exact string match and
authority file look up for matching entities.

3. Implementation
We have 158,079 EAC-CPF records — 114,639
persons, 41,177 corporate bodies and 2,263 family
names — derived from Library of Congress, the
Online Archive of California, and Northwest Digital
Archive EAD records. The records were parsed with
the EAC-CPF specification to extract information on
an entity’s name, type, and relations, stored in a
relational database. Preferred and alternate names
from the VIAF name authority files were indexed using

the Cheshire II information retrieval engine (Larson
et.al, 1996), which uses a probabilistic information
retrieval algorithm to find the top n VIAF records and
their associated names given an entity name. We
mapped each EAC-CPF entity to names from top n
VIAF records (currently the top five VIAF records).
These mappings are also represented in a relational
database.
The primary approach is based on the simple
hypothesis that two EAC-CPF records belong to the
same entity if the entity names exactly match. This
simple technique reduced the total number of unique
records to 129,915. This meant that EAC-CPF records
with different names belonging to the same entity were
not matched. This was often due to the presence of
existence dates in the name fields (e.g., “Einstein,
Albert, 1879-1955” will not match “Einstein, Albert”).
Our second technique uses the hypothesis that entities
referring to the same name authority record must be
the same. Our database and index setup made this
easy. For a given pair of entities, we search the entity
VIAF names mapping table for alternate names for
the first entity. If the second entity’s name appears
in the first entity’s list of possible alternate names,
we consider the two entities to be the same. Match
results are parameterized by how liberal the search
is: including names from all the top five ranked VIAF
records would result in a higher number of matches
but fewer accurate matches. Using names from higher
ranked VIAF records would give a lower number of
matches with better accuracy. However, evaluation of
the technique showed that using the best matching or
top ranked VIAF record reduced the number of unique
EAC-CPF records to 124,657, or 5248 records less
than what was achieved using the exact name match
technique. This was contrary to our expectations and
further evaluation suggested that it was a result of
either subtle differences in the way the names are
spelled and punctuated or the use of names that are
not present in the authority files. Using lower ranked
VIAF records reduced the number of unique records
but introduced serious matching errors and was not a
viable option.

4. Conclusions
We have described our current implementations that
match and merge EAC-CPF records belonging to the
same entity. Our implementations use exact name
match as the criteria or use the name authority files
as an external reference to disambiguate and find
matches. Our current technique finds mostly accurate
matches; false matches occur only when there are two

59

Digital Humanities 2011

different entities with the same name or when the name
authority file has inaccurate information. Although it is
possible for different entities to have the same name,
the use of existence dates can differentiate the names
and given that the VIAF record combines information
from institutions with rigorous standards, it is unlikely
that the records will have inaccurate information.
However, our current approach still fails to identify
many possible matches. The main reasons seem to
be subtle variations in names and punctuation or use
of names that are not present in the authority files.
To handle spelling issues, we plan to experiment
on using string comparison algorithms (such as “edit
distance” algorithms) and use comparison results
as features for a clustering algorithm. We will also
experiment with other information about the entities,
such as their biographies, relations with other entities,
works produced, etc., and external sources such as
DBPedia. However, because entity description records
are created for individual archives, it is possible
that this additional information is non-redundant and
therefore not useful for matching purposes.

1. Introduction
While authority file interfaces for library authority
control is reasonably well understood, archival
authority records provide more detailed description
and possibly extensive entries to related persons,
corporate bodies, and families, and related resources.
This paper will explore the opportunities and
challenges faced in designing and implementing a
public interface to access the unique archival authority
record aggregations created by the SNAC project.
The prototype access system 1 strives to enable
humanities researchers to make use of archival context
records that describe individuals, families, and formally
organized groups to find resources and identify social
and professional relations that are hard to discover
using existing research tools and techniques. Existing
methods require searching and exploring dispersed
archival finding aids and using the descriptions found
to further search and explore dispersed finding aids.
The SNAC access system does this work for the
researcher, bringing this information together in a
searchable database and exposing the discovered
social graph as open linked data.
The prototype was made available for public testing
on December 17, 2010. From December 17, 2010,
through February 17, 2011, the site had 47,857 visits
and 104,223 page views, with 91.37% of traffic coming
from Google searches. An iterative development
model is being utilized, and user feedback on the
prototype will help us to identify and prioritize ongoing
development activities. New features are released into
the prototype site on an ongoing basis, as they are
developed. Grant-funded interface development will
cease in April 2012 with the completion of the project.

Source code for the access interface is also available
as open source software 2.
A copy of the social graph derived from the research
data was released as a graphML file 3 on February
17, 2011, under the Open Data Commons Attribution
License 4. Analysis is ongoing to figure out the optimal
way to represent the social graph in a conventional
RDF model (such as with the FOAF ontology).

2. Technical Infrastructure
The semantics and structure of the records based on
the EAC-CPF schema has been the starting point of
the initial prototype. The prototype is being built as an
application of the eXtensible Text Framework (XTF)
and will support search, display, and navigation of
EAC-CPF records 5. The Tinkerpop Graph Processing
Stack 6 is also being utilized by the project to load
the relationships recorded in the derived EAC records
into a graph database and exposing it though a
REST API to the interactive graph visualizations in the
prototype interface. The Tinkerpop stack is compatible
with linked data technologies through the RDF Sail
interface, and will be used as the platform to expose
the project’s data as linked data when the semantic
modeling is complete.

3. Current and Future Development
The access system being developed resembles library
systems based on authority control, but the EACCPF archival authority records are far more complex
than those created by the library community. In
addition to entry control (authorized and alternative
names), the archival authority records frequently
have biographical-historical data, occupation, dates of
existence, languages used, as well links to related
people and resources. An additional challenge is
presented by relative quantities of descriptive data
found in each record. Some records have as many
as 50 or more alternative names, scores of subject
headings, more than 50 related persons, families, or
corporate bodies, and many linked archival finding aids
or titles. Other descriptions are quite brief, based on
the name occurring in one finding aid and failing to
match an authority record. Finding the right method
for displaying and facilitating navigation of this data
presents many challenges.
The initial prototype focuses on searching, browsing
and displaying the EAC-CPF records as formatted web
pages for researchers. Both full text (description less
control data) and specific component searches are
supported. Full text searches are weighted to give

preference to matches in the <identity> section of
the record, where all forms of the name of the entity
discovered in the derivation, matching, and merging
processes are listed. Limiting a search to the <identity>
section restricts the retrieval to just the forms of name
found in the section, and thus excludes matches in
other parts of the description, such as in entries
for related named entities. As users enter searches,
authorized forms of names are suggested. Users can
browse the top occupations and subjects in addition
to an alphabetical index of all names in the database.
The alphabetical index feature is likely to become less
useful as the number of records increases. (At this
date, there are over 123,920 named entities.) Search
results can be narrowed down to names that have a
particular occupation or subject term associated, or
restricted to entity type, such as person, corporate
body, or family.
In the initial prototype, a wide variety of data and links
are displayed to the user. For each EAC-CPF record,
the following descriptive components are displayed:
authoritative name, alternative names, dates of
existence, sex, affiliated countries, occupations,
subject terms used in describing related archival
records (for record creators), and biographical/
historical description (either as prose or a chronological
list). In addition to the above biographical/historical
data, the following linked information will also be
displayed: related persons, corporate bodies, and
families; descriptions of related archival records (that
is, finding aids within which the name was discovered),
published work by or about the described entity. Links
are also provided to a matching Virtual International
Authority File (VIAF) record, when one is identified as
matching.
Though the outbound links to finding aids and VIAF
records are currently implemented, the internal "links,"
for now, are implemented as searches.
While the derivation, matching, and merging
processing continues, the persistence of any given
EAC-CPF record cannot be ensured: a record may be
merged into another record in subsequent processing,
so it is difficult to assign persistent identifiers or
addresses in links to related entities. Once the deriving,
matching, and merging is complete (late in the project),
links to associated persons, corporate bodies, and
families will directly retrieve the related records.
The list of titles for resources by and about the
described entity that have been gathered in the
record is currently inactive. We anticipate eventually
using entries in this list to query WorldCat. When
the project is complete, additional links will be
61

Digital Humanities 2011

made to descriptions of named entities in DBpedia
and WorldCat Identities, where matching entries are
found. Also under consideration is offering users the
opportunity to use authoritative and alternative name
entries to search a selection of archive, library, and
museum access systems, and public resources such
as Google, Bing, and Flickr.
Another objective of SNAC is to employ a display
and navigation tool to graphically display and facilitate
the navigation of the social and professional networks
discovered and documented in the EAC-CPF records
and their relations to one another. Visualization of
abstract networks is a well-studied problem and there
are many tools available that support the graphML
file format that the project has used to represent the
historical social graph released under an open license.
The project’s objective is to develop a visualization
and navigation interface that will make it possible for
humanities researchers to explore and discover socialprofessional relations and related resources that would
be difficult to explore and discover using simple lists.
Experimentation with appropriate graph visualization
and navigation interfaces is ongoing at the time of
this writing, and a primitive version of this feature was
released in February 2010.
In the public interface to the prototype resource and
access system, we are concerned not only with
people interacting with the system; but also their
computational agents. The semantic web and open
data movements are developing new ways of linking
and expressing the relations between data used by
researchers. The project intends to make the EACCPF records available as Linked Data. At a minimum,
the XML files will be made available, but the project will
also explore using RDF and perhaps other mappings
of all or some of the data.
At the time of the conference the prototype resource
will still be under active development. The paper will
describe and demonstrate the latest version of the
prototype available at the time of the conference, and
solicit feedback from the participants that will be helpful
in setting the final development agenda for the final
year of the project.

Literary Practice and the Digital

Poetry

This panel brings together four of the central theoristpractitioners in the field of what is commonly called
electronic literature for a discussion of the question
of data as/and poetry. Drawing on a range of
aesthetic and discursive traditions – from sublimity
to communication theory – panelists will consider
the structural and operational logics of writing in
programmable and networked media. As a foundation
for more general theoretical inquiry, they will engage
specific compositional practices ranging from Perl
poetry generators to writing with and against Google
search algorithms. In broad terms, then, the panel
will contribute to the conversation about the role and
function of literary aesthetics and practices in the digital
humanities. It is in sympathy with the “material turn”
in the digital humanities toward the platform and the
mechanism, but it seeks more fully to understand the
relations between material form and aesthetic effects
(and affects).

waywardness is historically and formally tied to poetry,
situating data in the discourse of the sublime and in
relation to a tradition of the metaphoric and the figural.
As poetic discourse, the wayward or unaccountable
is a problematic enunciative tactic, the rhetorical
“lighting up” of detritus into significance and readability.
Various “codework” practices can be seen as pursuing
such tactics as uttering data and enunciating the
author’s name through the data midden. Nick Montfort
discusses some of the textures of data and code, and
the complexity of these two categories, in Montfort’s
ppg256 (Perl Poetry Generator in 256 Characters)
series. Even in the acrostic method of Jackson Mac
Low, the set of “data” consists of two different sorts
of data, source text and seed text, that are used
differently. In the ppg256 series, the only textual “data”
is in quoted strings embedded in the code. Despite
these complexities, making the distinction between
code and data is important to understanding how
ppg256 generators work and is important to the poetics
underlying these programs. Noah Wardrip-Fruin’s
presentation traces one particular birth narrative of
an operational logic, that of the n-gram as a literary
logic. It connects mathematicians such as Claude
Shannon and Andrei Markov, the contributors to
popular personal computer publications such as Byte
Magazine and Scientific American, as well as figures
such as Hugh Kenner and Charles O. Hartman. Finally,
in contrast, the independent development of literary
n-gram techniques by artists such as John Cayley
is used to ask whether such logics are as different
from collision detection (and others representing the
physical world) as they may seem. John Cayley’s
remarks will be directed to those tools, instruments
and services that now give us close-to-no-cost access
to indexed, mapped, statistically modeled, data-driven
views of the largest corpus of language practice
on the planet. He will do this with reference to
three ongoing projects: ‘writing to be found,’ which
explores techniques for generating aesthetic linguistic
forms with=against services like Google; The Readers
Project (with Daniel C. Howe), which might be thought
of as ‘writing through visualizing reading’; and The
Natural Language Liberation Front, which engages,
agonistically, with the institutions and institutional
consequences of all these new relations of literary
production.

Sandy Baldwin considers the problem of data
and poetry in terms of what might be called the
unaccountable or “wayward.” He argues that such

“just as interface cannot – finally – be decoupled from
functionality, neither can aesthetics be decoupled from
interface.” (Kirschenbaum 2004, IV.34)
What is the interface to a collection? How has
the interface to scholarly collections or corpora
64

changed from print to the web? What interfaces are
possible? As the scale of information that we have
access to grows exponentially we are increasingly
dealing with collections of documents rather than
documents as individuals. These collections, whether
they are craft collections of TEI documents like the
Globalization Compendium (http://globalautonom
y.ca) or industrial collections like Google Books
(http://books.google.com/), are the way we see
through to human artifacts and the way we manage
them. Collections and the ways they are put together
impose interfaces on the individual artifacts in order
to collect them. For this reason we are organizing
a panel that pays attention to the collected interface
and its evolution. While the interface to the collection
would seem unimportant compared to the interface for
reading the artifact itself, in this epoch of digital excess
we believe that it is the corpus interface that is the
way into the excess and it is the corpus interface that
structures the readers perceptions of the scope and
purposes of any collection.
The apparently obvious distinction between data and
interface is troubled in various ways, most often from
the user perspective, where details of the underlying
architecture are not visible, so that the interface
becomes, for all practical purposes, the data. From the
perspective of the developer, on the other hand, the
issue is one of layers of interface, not necessarily in
the graphical user sense, but rather between different
forms of representation of the data and code. For
certain kinds of information graphics, theorists like Ben
Schneiderman point out that one particularly effective
design strategy involves “direct manipulation”, where
the data is treated by the user as a kind of interactive
widget (Shneiderman, Williamson & Ahlberg 1992). In
this case, as in our final presentation in this panel, the
question becomes one of how many layers of interface/
data can be usefully superimposed to create not just
a communicative environment, but also one where
arguments can be formulated and considered.
In this panel, members of the Interface Design team
of the Implementing New Knowledge Environments
(INKE) project will discuss the manner in which
collection interfaces are influenced by the structure
of the materials included, by the history of traditions
for representing collections, and by the intended use/
needs of the users. We will review both print and digital
interfaces in an effort to understand the way in which
interacting with textual and non-textual content has
changed and evolved.
As Clay Shirky points out, the problem of information
overload makes us feel good as it explains why we
aren’t getting anything done. It is also a standard

Digital Humanities 2011

starter for explaining the need for new information
technologies. In Plato’s Phaedrus Socrates tells the
story of the invention of writing (274c – 275b) which
is developed ostensibly to help our memories and
therefore make us wiser. Vannevar Bush in “As We
May Think” likewise uses the problem of overload
to introduce his ideas about new technologies like
the hypertext workstation the Memex (1945, p.102).
Clay Shirky, after acknowledging how overused this
trope of overload is by technology writers, goes on
to use it again to argue that the problem is actually
“filter failure” (2008). In this panel we too are reusing
this trope of overload and overabundance to practice
what Matthew Kirschenbaum calls for in “’So the
Colors Cover the Wires’: Interface, Aesthetics, and
Usability.” Kirschenbaum argues that computers are
“venues for representation” (emphasis in the original)
and therefore we need to study the aesthetics of their
interfaces, though the aesthetics can’t be detached
from functionality (2004, IV.34)
This panel will, in sum, start with a general introduction
of the problem, then look at the collected interface
through five short interventions that either reflect back
on the evolution of interface or look forward showing
experimental interfaces as to what could be.

The Citation from Print to the
Web
Sondheim, Daniel

citation. Perhaps all we need to connect to a reference
is a search string for Google.
Juxtaposition is a pattern of citation design where
the citation is placed in the flow of the text, as in
inline citation. The connective value of the citation
comes from what it is juxtaposed with on the page. We
will expand on inline citation to look at other spatial
arrangements of information, both on the page and the
screen.
The Canonical citation is a pattern that points to an
ontologically general idea of a work. We will show how
canonical citation has been instantiated online such
that the user can interact with multiple editions of the
referenced.
The Footnote is a pattern of citation design that
creates a relationship between source text and cited
text in a visual space. The citation is moved to the foot,
but it can be moved aside in other ways especially
online.
The citation of Other Media is a pattern in which
the object of citation is of a different type than the
citation itself. We are seeing citations within digital
video and computer games. How are we to understand
the adaptation of citation expectations to other media?
To conclude, we will show that current interfaces for
navigating collections bear similarities to particular
forms of citation, but that navigation is beginning to
evolve beyond its print patterns.

PAPER 3

The Paper Drill
Ruecker, Stan

What holds the collection together? One of the most
important interface features for scholars is the lowly
citation. The citation, whether in print or hypertextually
instantiated on the web, is one of the interface features
that weaves together citations through associations.
In this panel presentation, we will survey the design
of the citation as it has evolved from print to the web
by presenting a draft topology of five citation design
patterns:
Absence of citation is a (non)pattern of missing citation
that reminds us of the historical construction of citation
and its importance to scholarship. We will compare
instances of missing references in print to their online
equivalents that suggest a collaborative future for

In this panel presentation, we consider the question
of how the principles of rich- prospect browsing
can be used to extend the design of a databasereporting tool for journals in the humanities. While
the previous presentation surveys existing interfaces,
this one presents a new experimental interface, The
Paper Drill, designed to navigate collections of articles
through citations.

Diachronic View on Digital

Figure 1: Paper Drill prototype

This presentation looks at the interface design of three
successful and important digital collections: Project
Gutenberg
(http://www.gutenberg.org/),
Perseus
Digital Library (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/) and
the Victorian Web (http://www.victorianweb.org/
index.html). Each of these projects has existed for over
10 years and gone through multiple interface designs,
sometimes across technologies, which makes them
ideal subjects for a diachronic analysis of the evolution
of interfaces to digital collections. Studying interface
evolution over time helps us understand:
1. The relationship between the nature of the
functionalities provided and interface design;

Figure 2: Paper Drill prototype

In the first year of INKE, we began to explore the
possible affordances of a tool to support scholars in
following citation trails through collections of academic
articles (Ruecker et al. 2009). Our approach was to
prototype a tool called The Paper Drill, where the user
could choose a seed article, then obtain a report about
the most frequently cited authors or articles. In year
two, we are continuing development of the Paper Drill,
but have added the concept of showcase browsing,
where the home page of the tool provides heatmaps of
the most frequently cited articles, arranged according
to date range and journal category. The purpose
of this overview is to add information that is not
otherwise available in the display until after a report has
been generated. We have also been experimenting
with data sources, since the system becomes more
effective (and the showcase visualization a more
complex challenge) as the metadata in humanities
journals improves. We will demonstrate The Paper Drill
working on a journal article collection.

The methodology of the study includes, but is not

an environmental scan of all available versions of
interfaces employed, and, where possible, interviews
with people involved in the projects.
We will conclude our presentation by acknowledging
the role played by interface design in the success of
these collections and by assessing the value of the
diachronic approach adopted in our study for interface
analyses.

The Corpus from Print to the
Web

Structured Surfaces for JiTR

Rockwell, Geoffrey

geoffrey.rockwell@ualberta.ca
University of Alberta

In this presentation, we will examine the design and
evolution of corpus interfaces by comparing features
from two epochs of information design, the epoch of
print and that of the web. In order to survey this variety
of design we will present a draft topology of corpus
design patterns. Patterns that we have identified
include legal, religious, literary and archaeological
corpora.
Notable print corpora include the 6th century Corpus
Juris Civilis, a collection of Roman laws that had as a
notable effect the disappearance of the original writings
on which it is based. In effect the collection replaces the
individuals from history. Another significant example
is The Royal Imperial Coinage, a print catalogue of
Roman coins equipped with a variety of complex and
innovative search and access interfaces.
We will then show the creative ways in which
corpus interfaces have been adapted to the online
environment, along with the attendant novel methods
of access and navigation that are then offered. For
instance, the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, begun
in print in 1853 and now being maintained and
developed on the web, illustrates the effects of web
remediation on searching and layout for traditional
corpora. The Pyramid Texts Online recreates the
original physical structure of the corpus, offering an
inventive map-based navigational interface leading to
translations and photographs of original texts.
To conclude, this paper will reflect back on the
development of the corpus from print to web, and will
show how interface features within particular patterns
have matured in the move to the web.

In this last presentation, we describe the usefulness
of a structured surface in the design of humancomputer interfaces to collections, and propose as an
experimental design idea user-generated structured
surfaces that can be controlled in an interactive
manner. These surfaces are interfaces that structure
items in a collection in different ways. A structured
surface is a cognitive interface artifact that provides a
layer of meaning that supports the data imposed upon
it.

Figure 3: Nightingale’s Rose Interface

We experimented with a mashup of content provided
by JiTR (Rockwell et al. 2009, Rockwell 2008) and a
structured surface inspired by Florence Nightingale’s
rose diagram. The surface is composed of wedges
representing months and a series of segments
representing cause of death. That’s where the original
information graphic ends, but we propose adding
an additional layer of information. In this case, dots

67

Digital Humanities 2011

representing medicine shipments. Alternatively, the
dots could represent the individual deaths of soldiers
from Shropshire or number of ambulances with flat
tires. In the context of JiTR, depending on your
metadata, the wedges might represent genre, the
segments authorship, and the dots are individual
people who were at last year’s DH conference. We
should mention that the structured surface could be
one of a number of preexisting visualizations. Our
intention is to experiment with Stanford’s excellent
collection at Protovis.com (Heer et al. 2010). We feel
that the third layer of information represented by the
dots or pins provides an exciting opportunity for people
assembling dynamic collections to feed into the text
analysis tools available through JiTR.

Automatic Extraction of Hidden
Keywords by Producing
“Homophily” within Semantic
Networks

A complex network is usually conceived of in the
form of a graph consisting of nodes representing
individual, or atomic, entities and edges linking them
according to information about semantic attributes or
some weighting value. This intellectual intuition can be
applied to the world of language where a sign makes
sense through the concurrent presence of other signs
(Saussure, 1916). In particular, the semantic aspect
of a document, as a group of more or less coherent
sentences, depends on co-occurrence information
about the words being bound together to form topics.
When a content-bearing word is found within a
neighborhood of other words, one may assume that
they produce a constellation of meaning (Schütze,
1997; Takayama, 1999). Conceptual interrelatedness
can be represented in a graph form called a semantic
network. Similarly, in the field of digital humanities,
the graph-based approach to document analysis is
becoming a major research trend (Miyake, 2009).
In semantic networks, graph coefficients are useful
for examining the features of language data, such
as a document or corpus, from the perspective of
meaning. Hubs with the highest degree values can be
regarded as being as key words (excluding functional
words), that are highly involved in producing the
document context. In normal cases, the bias of degree
distributions to follow a power law (or, more concretely,
Zipf’s law) has been handled by the concept of scalefree (Barabási et al., 1999) for complex networks.
However, one graph index that researchers are
increasingly paying close attention to is the concept
of ‘intrinsic weights’ that are not distributed to edges
but to vertices (Caldarelli et al., 2002; Boguñá et

al., 2003; Masuda et al, 2004). The emergence of
this weighting within some network settings certainly
leads a situation where vertex degree generates a
phenomena known as the ‘Rich Club’ (Zhou et al,
2004; Colizza et al., 2006), consisting of hubs with high
intrinsic weights. However Masuda et al. (2006) have
revealed a contrastive kind of subgraph area, which
they figuratively refer to as a ‘VIP Club’, where vertices
with similar weighting values are exclusively connected
to form a confined circle of privileged elites. This
“homophily” tendency (Axelrod, 1997; Barrat et al.,
2004; Centola et al.2007) makes the average shortest
path length significantly longer, so that the innermost
graph area becomes harder to access, forming a
preserve for the so-called ‘masterminds’ (Masuda et
al., 2006).
These elite entities may be, in some sense, regarded
as ‘hidden keywords’ within complex networks, where
all the words are interconnected—at dense intervals
—from a paradigmatic perspective (Jacobson, 1963).
These mastermind words are unquestionably of
moderately high frequency or degree, but they are
tightly related to one another by ‘homophilous’ ties
to form very important but discreet lexical patterns.
The term homophilous here means a significantly
high value of ‘degree correlation’ (Boguñá et al,
2003; Boccaletti et al., 2006), which serves as a
marker for the VIP-Club phenomenon (See Figure I).
These mastermind words, which are relatively difficult
to retrieve during comprehension within the reading
process, sometimes play a crucial role in producing
well-calculated subliminal effects or hinting at authors’
obsessions with their long-cherished themes.
Be that as it may, the Incremental Advancing Window
(IAW), a windowing method (Burges, 1998; Lemaire
et al., 2005) that Akama et al (2008) have proposed
in order to extract word association patterns from a
whole document, clearly satisfies the requirements for
creating a homophilous semantic network from lexical
co-occurrence information. From such a graph, it is
possible to extract hidden keywords with moderate
frequencies as members of the clusters regarded as
being VIP-Clubs. In this method, the window proceeds
step by step through an entire document (after the
removal of noise words) to collect all word pairs
appearing at least once inside the frame. The list of
all pair instances thus obtained with their frequencies
makes it possible to generate a semantic network.
However, two parameters are set to some specific
values to adjust for recall and precision in the data
gathering: namely, the window size (diameter) is
changed from 1 to m and the threshold for word pair
frequency (theta; θ) is changed from 1 to n (m and n
71

Digital Humanities 2011

are both natural numbers larger than 1). For example,
if the theta value is 3, word pairs appearing less than 3
times in the window are ignored. Precisely, this means
that, no matter how frequently a word appears in a
text, keywords are rejected from the list of vertices
for the semantic network representing the text, if the
instances of paired words are extremely rare with
recorded frequencies lower than θ. This is why a graph
derived by IAW exhibits the homophily tendency, if we
consider degree itself to be an intrinsic weighting for a
vertex.
For instance, let us cite a study conducted by Akama et
al (2008) which applied IAW to Saint-Exupéry’s novel
"Le petit prince" (original French version). The sample
consisted of 1,312 content-bearing words remaining
after a stop list was applied. If window size (diameter)
is at the smallest level and threshold is similarly
maximally strict, then the words extracted by IAW
are numerically low, but they form tightly cohesive
aggregates, suggesting that the precision rate, P, and
the recall rate, R, are always in a trade-off relationship.
A severe windowing condition with a threshold value
set to 6 allowed us to recall the 38 most important
words from the standpoint of co-occurrence patterns,
but some of them were not included in the list of the
38 most frequent words. These hidden keywords, or
mastermind words, were «apprivoiser», «boa», «cent
un», «consigne», «fermé», «manger», «monde»,
«posséder», «ramoner», «région», «unique», and
«volcan», which could all be characterized as
homophilous in terms of degree similarity.
In contrast, words that were among the top
words but excluded from the most severe IAW
computational conditions were «aimer», «ami»,
«baobab», «connaître», «croire», «dessin», «jour»,
«nuit», «grande personne», «rose», «sérieux», and
«venir», which are all ordinary keywords sharing the
feature of heterophily in terms of degree-frequency
—a tendency to be linked, or even collocated, with
many different words (Figure II). In the smallest
semantic network containing both groups of words
(window size = 7, threshold for pair frequency = 6),
the average shortest path lengths from all dangling
nodes representing peripheral words to the vertices of
these 12 masterminds (the first group) and to those of
the purely general keywords (the second group) were
4.172 and 3.747, respectively, representing a highly
significant difference according to a conducted t test
(Figure III).
This result reveals much about the characteristic traits
of mastermind words, which when coupled with graph
clustering, permits us to understand how they shape
communities that deserve the label of VIP-Clubs. To
72

prove this, Markov Clustering (MCL) was applied to
the smallest semantic network with IAW parameters
of window size = 1 and threshold for pair frequency
= 6 (thus screening out many weak co-occurrence
patterns and focusing on the most frequent instances
of bi-gram). MCL proposed by Van Dongen (2001)
is well known as a scalable unsupervised cluster
algorithm for graphs that decomposes a whole graph
into small coherent groups by simulating the probability
movements of a random walker across the graph. It
is assumed that when MCL is applied to semantic
networks, it yields clusters of words that share certain
similarities in meaning or that appear to be related
to common concepts (Dorow et al., 2005; Jung et
al, 2007). As a matter of fact, the present clustering
results produced some clusters which consist almost
exclusively of homophilous masterminds, such as
{monde, unique}, {boa, fermé, serpent}, and {éteindre,
volcan, ramoner}. These clusters suggest a series of
subtopics that are not so dominating within the novel,
but that convey a persistent and deep resonance to the
readers.
As described, a text, when treated in the form
of a graph, exhibits some hidden keywords that
can be enumerated as mastermind entities through
the analysis of a homophilous semantic network.
Furthermore, if a graph clustering method, such as
MCL, is applied to the network, the vertices with
such features are categorized into sub-topic clusters,
known as VIP-Clubs. Despite the moderate degrees
(frequencies) of these vertices (words), they are
inconspicuously combined to create lexical patterns
which, although they are minor, or subsidiary, in
nature, are yet effective.

Figure I : A homophilous graph (left) and a
heterophilous graph (right) : an agglomeration of
‘VIP-Club’ is recognizable in the homophilous graph,
while homogeneity underlies the heterophilous graph.
Both networks with the same number of nodes (50)
and the same connectivity (38.5%) are produced
by respectively applying different pruning functions-which consist of trimming edges with probabilities

Digital Humanities 2011

varying according to the weight correlation--to an
identical random graph whose distribution of ‘intrinsic
weights’ follows the degree distribution of the equalsized BA model (scale-free graph). The two pruning
functions are

where abslogdiff stands for the absolute value of
the logarithmically-transformed difference of ‘intrinsic
weights’ between any two vertices.

1. Introduction
TextGrid’s Text-Image-Link-Editor (TBLE “stands for
for Text-Bild-Link-Editor, German for Text-ImageLink-Editor”) is used to link segments of text with
sections on the corresponding image. A typical
application is linking of scans of facsimiles with
their transcriptions, though these texts can also be
created during the linking process, which allows
e.g. also for image annotations. The information on
the linking between manuscript fragments and the
corresponding transcription is itself stored in TEI.
TextGrid is as a virtual research environment (VRE) for
the humanities disciplines dealing with texts in a wide
sense (philologies, epigraphy, linguistics, musicology,
art history etc.). The joint research project TextGrid
is part of the D-Grid initiative, and is funded by the
German Federal Ministry of Education and Research
(BMBF) for the period starting June 1, 2009 to May 31,
2012 (reference number: 01UG0901A).
TextGrid consists of two principal building blocks,
the grid-based backend TextGridRep that hosts both
infrastructure services and the repository layer for
access to research data and longterm archiving, and
the user-facing TextGridLab. The TextGrid Laboratory
(TextGridLab), a single point of entry to the virtual
research environment, will provide integrated access
to both new and existing tools and services via a
user friendly software [TG]. TBLE is a key component
of the TextGridLab that has been under continuous
development since 2008 and is by now in practical use.

2. State of the Art
The integration of manuscript scans with their
transcription and indeed the critical edition itself is a
74

Digital Humanities 2011

desideratum of modern editions: “While some people
continue to think of electronic texts as exclusive of
images, the fact is that digital images of manuscripts
are electronic texts, as well. The most compelling
scholarly editions of the future will make full use of
markup schemes such as XML [...], but not without
extensive integration of images” [Kiernan2006]. In this
context TextGrid is not the only project that recognized
the need for an tool to facilitate this linking of image
sections with transcriptions. The Edition Production
& Presentation Technology's (EPPT's) [EPPT] tool
box for integrating images and text operates in much
the same solution space. [Parker2009] proposes the
development of a web-based Text-Image Linking
Environment (TILE), and for much the same reasons
as the TBLE, namely to facilitate “the linking of images
and textual information [which] remains a slow and
frustrating process for editors and curators”. [TILE]
is currently under development.1 Unlike the Eclipsebased TBLE, TILE is Ajax-based, extending the Ajax
XML Encoder.
Similar in objective to TBLE and developed in much the
same timeframe is Tapor’s / the University of Victoria’s
Image Markup Tool [Holmes2010]. Both independently
decided to use formats based on TEI P5 to store
linking information, though at this stage unfortunately
not the same. Unlike TBLE, the Image Markup Tool is
a desktop program only for the MS Windows platform
and cannot be integrated into the TextGridLab.
[Cayless2008] reports on experiments to partially
automate the linking between manuscripts and
their transcriptions. TBLE plans to integrate similar
functionality using OCR technology (cf. below).
As required in [Huitfeld2010], TBLE allows, in Peirce’s
terminology, multiple “types” to be associated with one
“token”, or in other words to associate one section
in a manuscript with multiple, possibly contradictory
interpretations / transcriptions. Image sections can
overlap, so that divergent segmentations are possible.
As an aside, this type of linking is very different from the
research field of automated image analysis and image
annotation which attempts to automatically establish
key metadata for an image, e.g. by identifying the
objects or persons shown on a photo.

3. Functionality
The following use case is a typical example for
working with the TBLE: A scholar wants to publish
manuscripts as collection of images, which offer a
digital representation of the original work, but also
wants to publish his take on its correct transcription in

view of establishing a critical edition. The solution is to
write the content of these hand written documents as
text in a human/machine readable format e.g. XML and
this text can be divided into logical related segments for
example: verses, lines and then these text segments
can be easily linked with the corresponding sections on
the images using the TBLE.
The TBLE can be used for:

3.1. Linking Existing Texts and Digitized
Manuscripts
Text and image are opened, then the corresponding
components (text segment and selected image
section) are marked by pairs and the linkage is
confirmed. The results can be saved as a new file
(local or in the TextGridRepository), which contains the
linking information (image coordinates, text segment
identifiers, URIs of the used text and image files).
Sections can be rectangles or arbitrary polygons.
The content of the new created file represents
the saved information as a TEI document with an
embedded [SVG] section (see section 4 “The TEIModel” for more details). Once a file is saved, double
clicking it reloads used images, texts and links to
continue editing. Changing or adding new links as well
as modifying the linked text is possible at any time.
Instead of starting out with an existing transcription
and linking it with the image data, the scholar can also
decide to start from scratch with an empty text file. The
new text segments can be inserted stepwise or at once.
Any number of different and possibly conflicting
transcriptions and segmentations can be linked against
one set of digitized manuscripts.

3.2. Annotation of Image Sections and
Existing Links
The Text-Image-Link-Editor offers many other useful
features, that help annotating specific links or image
sections. For example:
1. It's possible to build logical groups of links (e.g.
verses, comments, etc.) using the layers-tool.
2. A text-direction (e.g. left-to-right & top-to-bottom)
can be assigned to the links.

4. The TEI-Model
The output file of the Text-Image-Link-Editor follows
the TEI model with embedded svg description

75

Digital Humanities 2011

elements. The following is a list, which crudely
describes the structure of the TEI document:
1. <teiHeader> this element could be used to save the
metadata of the document.
2. <facsimile> in this element is the svg
element embedded, which keeps the topographic
descriptions of images and links.
3. <body> in the body element are the link groups,
that contain the link elements. These link elements
represent the relationship between the image
sections and the corresponding text segments. The
relationship between images and texts and links is
represented in the following figure:

TBLE in action

6. Further Enhancement
TBLE is already actively used in a number of projects,
but continues to be enhanced, taking into account new
user requirements coming up in the field. In particular,
we plan to implement a new feature in the Text-ImageLink-Editor to enable an automated segmentation of
facsimiles using the [OCRopus] OCR-system, which
offers a possibility to partially automate the linkage
process.3

The TEI output file of the Text-Image-Link-Editor to describe the
relationship between images and texts and links [Maynooth2010]

5. Structure and Components
The Text-image-Link-Editor is a part of the
TextGridLab and is implemented as a group of Eclipse
plugins following the [MVC] pattern2.
This tool consists of a Toolkit and two views in addition
to the XML Editor and the generic Navigator:
- Image View: shows the images and enables you to
select individual image sections to be linked.
- Thumb View: is used for navigation. It displays a
reduced version of the entire image and the active
image detail (which is enlarged in the Image View)
which can easily be moved and zoomed.
- Toolkit: provides different functions for working on
the Image View.
- XML Editor: allows you to open or create texts as
well as to select individual text elements.

Content Patterns in Digital
Humanities: a Framework for
Sustainability and Reuse of
Digital Resources

Research in the arts and humanities has created much
digital material that represents a significant investment,
both of funding and of intellectual effort. In the UK at
least, given the current lack of national infrastructure
for sustaining this material, these resources are
typically hosted in their home institutions using a
variety of approaches and technologies.
This incurs a number of risks. At the most basic level,
without ongoing maintenance a resource ceases to
be usable at all as the technologies in which it was
implemented become obsolete and unsupported. Even
if hosting institutions apply preservation techniques to
ensure continued accessibility of resources, this does
not enable collections to make full use of technological
advances that might greatly enhance their utility for and
impact on research. Access to legacy resources may
be limited to a simple download or browser access in
a website. In neither case does this facilitate advanced
research services, such as mashups or data/text
mining, that will become increasingly common in future
digital research.
The impact of humanities research may still be felt
many years after the original research was undertaken
– the information produced has a long lifespan in
intellectual terms. Sustainability does not just mean
keeping the data alive, but enabling the exploitation
of advances both in technology – making the data
accessible in new ways – and in humanities research
– forging connections between resources that lead to
new discoveries and broader impact.
Digital resources often exist in “silos”, lacking
interoperability. Individual projects typically address
focused topics, and may implement digital resources
in idiosyncratic ways and to address their immediate
needs. This results in a multitude of resources that
77

Digital Humanities 2011

are scattered and disparate in nature, yet related
intellectually, resources that, linked up, would form a
whole much more useful for research than the sum
of the parts, much as fragments of a map, when
combined, allow navigation from one place to another.
Ultimately, the vision here is of a virtual and distributed
“web of knowledge”.
The digital resources in the humanities may be
characterised by their diversity and complexity.
Collections involve multiple media and standards.
The material may be highly complex, with many
structural and semantic relationships both internal
and contextual; the interpretation of an object (e.g.
an inscription) may depend on its relationships to
other resources (e.g. other inscriptions/texts, surveys,
concordances).
One approach to this would be to develop
enhancements to individual resources; however, to
be truly sustainable we should avoid such ad hoc
solutions. The primary question asked by our project
is thus – how can we develop a generic framework
for digital resources in the arts and humanities that
addresses the above issues for a broad range of
collections, and that is not a closed system but can be
extended to support other digital material and (possibly
unanticipated) future tools, technologies and research
methods?
We are attempting to answer this question in the CMES
(Content Models for Enhancement and Sustainability)
project, which is funded by the UK Arts and Humanities
Research Council as part of its DEDEFI (Digital
Equipment and Database Enhancement for Impact)
programme. We are developing a framework using
the Fedora digital repository software for sustaining
and enhancing particular groups of digital resources
produced by earlier digital humanities. We are
addressing two groups of collections, each typical of a
wide range of humanities research activities:
1. Digital texts, which may comprise complex networks
of diverse information: images, markedup text,
geospatial data, translations, standoff annotations/
markup, and potentially extensive links to external
resources. We are addressing two groups of
resources managed at KCL: the Stormont Papers,
and the Inscriptions of Aphrodisias. These
contrasting examples – one modern and dealing with
large, complete volumes, one ancient and dealing
with small, fragmentary texts –facilitate development
and testing of generic models. They also provide
scope for demonstrating the utility of our framework
for (i) developing new material (e.g. Stormont
parliamentary papers and Inscriptions of Roman
78

Tripolitania/Cyrenaica), and (ii) forging links with
external digital material (e.g. Westminster Hansards
and Pleiades).
2. Multimedia performing arts collections, specifically
the following resources managed at KCL: Scottish
Traditions of Dance, which contains text, images,
video, interviews, audio and databases, Adolphe
Appia, which contains images, 3D virtual reality
models, and audio from the King’s Sound Archive.
Fedora is particularly good for modelling complex
material and links between objects. Representations
of digital objects within Fedora are formalised as
“content models” (henceforth, CMs), which may be
regarded as “data types” for digital objects. We will
review the selected collection groups and develop a
set of CMs that support them by providing consistent,
standardised and interoperable (yet flexible) patterns
for representing these collection types. We will need to
go beyond Fedora’s relatively simple CM formalisation
to produce these “Content Patterns” (henceforth, CPs)
for complex collections, e.g. by using the Enhanced
CM framework developed by SULD, which allows the
specification of relationships and ontologies, and the
definition of collection templates.
We analysed the resources along with subject
specialists in digital text and performing arts resources.
Note that, given the variation in how legacy collections
have been implemented, the CPs may be idealisations
that do not directly match the collections, which may
require a degree of reworking to make them fit. We
will not be overprescriptive here – diversity arises
naturally from the research material – but a degree of
common practice would be beneficial for the creation
and reuse of the material. Moreover, our CPs will
provide foundations that can be extended easily to
support diverse community practices.
Each of the target collections had its own custom
web interface, driven by quite different underlying
data models. We are developing consistent delivery/
publishing mechanisms for the different collection
groups that are driven by the underlying CPs. This has
the benefit that these mechanisms are available for
any collection that conforms to the CP, leading to more
consistent and interoperable interfaces for resources
of similar type.
However, this will not necessarily lead to homogeneity.
Our approach enables the structure of collections to
be represented with fine granularity, and interfaces
are correspondingly modular. This facilitates the
creation of more integrated web views across
different collections, but it also allows content to
be exposed as machinereadable feeds that can be

Digital Humanities 2011

used to provide addedvalue services, e.g. aggregating
content, automated processing (e.g. text mining),
mashups etc. The creators (or curators) of a resource
will no longer be the arbiters of how information should
be delivered and used. The resources produced by
research are not just ends in themselves – they provide
source material for subsequent research – and to
maximise impact they should be made available in
ways that allow scholars unrelated to the original
editors to make transformative use of them, rather than
just via a website. We are thus providing a framework
whereby users (perhaps domain experts) can develop
and integrate their own tools to process resources.
The project is thus not only enhancing particular
collections, but producing a framework that is
extensible in several ways:
- The generic CPs and associated tools provide
templates for simplifying creation of new collections
of similar form (e.g. digital texts), and guarantee
certain functionality that conformant collections
would inherit from the template.
- The set of content patterns is itself extensible,
following the same methodology, to other collection
types.
- The framework can be extended with new tools as
technologies change (tools/services can be linked
to CPs and inherited by collections that follow the
pattern).
The project thus builds on existing efforts and provides
a foundation for a broader and longerterm programme
for sustaining and enhancing digital humanities
research. Developing this framework to support
resources based around digital texts and performing
arts will cover a significant amount of ground, and
provide a springboard for future extensions. It will also
ensure sustainability by integrating these initiatives into
repository and curation infrastructures at KCL, and
will allow a growing corpus of digital material to be
integrated into this infrastructure.

1. Summary
This paper describes a collaboration between
eScientists and humanists; specifically Grid scientists
and language and literature scholars, working together
to create a repository of data sets and tools, combining
our most advanced knowledge in all areas.
Language and literature scholars make use of variety
of language resources to conduct their research.
Such resources include dictionaries, thesauri, corpora,
images, audio and video collections. At present most
of these resources are distributed, non-interoperable
and license protected. As a result researchers typically
conduct their research through direct access to
independent data sets using multiple browser windows
and multiple authorisations. This approach results in
non-scalable and less productive research, and often
leads to incomplete and/or non-verifiable results.
The JISC funded project, Enhancing Repositories for
Language and Literature Researchers (Enroller) is
addressing these issues through development of a
targeted eResearch environment. This paper presents
the current state of progress and outlines how secure
access to distributed data resources with targeted
analysis and collaboration tools is supported. In the full
paper we will also describe how Enroller is exploiting
79

Digital Humanities 2011

high performance computing infrastructures such as
the UK National Grid Service and ScotGrid, and
discuss a problematic issue that has arisen through
the differing working practices of humanists and
scientists.Consider a typical language and literature
scenario where a researcher wants to search for a
word such as "bonny" in the dictionary to find its
meaning; in a thesaurus to look up the concepts
and categories it is found in and in a corpus to
find the documents containing it. The user may also
want to see the concordances and word frequency
of the word in each found document. In undertaking
this process, they might want to save the different
results; share them with others and possibly perform
a comparison between many different resultant data
sets. This scenario becomes more challenging when
multiple dictionaries, thesauri and text corpora need to
be cross-searched simultaneously, for example when
the researcher wants to lookup the word "bonny" in
the Oxford English Dictionary, in the Scottish National
Dictionary, and in the Dictionary of the Older Scottish
Tongue. The researcher may also want to search for
the word in the Historical Thesaurus of English to look
up synonyms and related concepts and categories and
then search for all of the matching concepts in further
corpus resources.
Researchers will want to use the standard text
analysis tools: e.g. concordances, word frequencies,
collocation clouds. They may well wish to save and
download the results for further analysis or use
targeted tools to investigate, e.g. variant spellings of
the word 'bonny'. The problem is further exacerbated if
the researcher decides to search for multiple, possibly
hundreds, of words at once and do all of the mentioned
tasks at once. Most of the language and literature
data environments do not permit scholars to do any
of these activities, instead researchers are left with
individual level data sets, coded differently (e.g. with
different metadata and data formatting), accessible
through individual web-based resources with individual
access codes and methods.
The challenge for the project is to maintain the data
integrity of its collaborators and the security of accesslimited data, while facilitating research across and
between each dataset for the benefit of researchers
in multiple fields. Enroller provides an interactive
research infrastructure that provides seamless, secure
access to all of the different language and literature
data sets in a user-oriented environment. Furthermore,
since many of the searching and analysis efforts can
be computationally intensive – especially when bulk
searching or building of indexes is required - we
provide secure access to high performance computing
80

infrastructures such as the UK e-Science National Grid
Service (http://www.ngs.ac.uk) and ScotGrid (http://
www.scotgrid.ac.uk). In this project, language and
literature researchers, including an associated network
of international scholars, are now able to access large
amounts of language and literature data and analysis
services from a single, easy-to-use portal. Enroller is
currently working with the following data sets:
- The EPSRC and AHRC funded Scottish Corpus of
Text and Speech is a collection of text and audio
files covering a period from 1945 to the present. The
SCOTS corpus is available in TEI-compliant XML.
(http://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk)
- The AHRC funded Corpus of Modern Scottish
Writing offers a collection of texts and manuscript
images from the period 1700 to 1945. (http://
www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/cmsw/)
- The AHRC funded Newcastle Electronic Corpus
of Tyneside English provides a corpus of dialect
speech from Tyneside in Northeast England. The
NECTE corpus is encoded in TEI-compliant XML.
(http://www.ncl.ac.uk/necte)
- The Dictionary of the Scots Language encompasses
two major Scottish language dictionaries: the
Scottish National Dictionary and the Dictionary of the
Older Scottish Tongue. DSL data is available in XML
format. (http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl)
- The Historical Thesaurus of English contains
more than 750,000 words from Old English to
the present in 250,000 categories. HTE was
published in print form by Oxford University
Press in 2009 and is a new and significant
development for historical language studies. (http://
libra.englang.arts.gla.ac.uk/historicalthesaurus/)
- The Oxford English Dictionary is a commercial
resource published by Oxford University Press and
is the authority on English language vocabulary. It
is accessible through our search interface by API.
(http://www.oed.com)
The inclusion of other data sets is underway, e.g.
we have incorporated Hansard, early C19th to late
C20th, and are negotiating for the 1755 Dictionary
of Samuel Johnson. Many scholars have no platform
or assistance to put texts online and make them
accessible to others, far less can they make them
interoperable with other relevant data sets. Enroller
provides a place where users can deposit their own
texts. Texts are wrapped in a basic, TEI minimal XML
envelope and indexed. The user can choose whether
a text is available to all or private. Once deposited a

Digital Humanities 2011

text can be searched from the portal with the other data
sets.

leth.internet2.edu (accessed 15/03/2011).

The project has data at its heart, but it is also
exploiting state of the art high-performance computing
and security solutions. In particular the project is
employing a Virtual Organisation Membership Service
(VOMS)-based solution in accessing the NGS where
pooled Enroller accounts are used by researchers
accessing these resources through a targeted project
portal. This includes use and exploitation of the
Workload Management System (WMS) to provide
resource broking based job scheduling across all of the
NGS nodes. This job scheduling is targeted currently
to supporting large-scale searching based upon the
Google MapReduce application.

The full paper will describe the Enroller project in
more detail and outline the capabilities that are
supported and our experiences so far in implementing
this infrastructure. This includes a description of how
the portal has been made accessible through the
UK Access Management Federation; the easy to
use search system and the reasons for its humancomputer interface choices; the advanced Grid-based
information retrieval system, capable of executing
linguistic workflows, taking advantage of HPC facilities
such as NGS and ScotGrid; how the system supports
large-scale data indexes for fast searching; support
for tools for linguistic analysis, including concordance,
collocation and word frequency analysis; support for
seamless secure access to licensed data; support
for data deposition and automated indexing services;
documented analysis of our user experiences in
using of the infrastructure provided thus far. We will
outline the plans for future adoption by the wider
research community and end with our reflections on
this eScience/humanities collaboration.

Handling Glyph Variants: Issues
and Developments
Anderson, Deborah

dwanders@sonic.net
Department of Linguistics, UC Berkeley

1. Introduction
The challenge of how to handle glyph variants when
encoding text has long been a dilemma for those
working with historical text materials. How can a digital
humanist specify a particular glyph of a Unicode
character, even if the glyph might be known to be an
error? Is it possible to search for the character, and find
instances of the “error” glyphs?
This short paper addresses issues involving glyph
variants, in light of recent developments within the
world of Unicode and W3C standardization, as well
as OpenType specifications (also an ISO standard).
The different options for handling glyph variants will
also be explored in view of sustainability, and viewed
from the general perspective of the Unicode character
encoding standard, with particular discussion of
Unicode variation sequences.

2. Gaiji
One option available to text encoders is to use the
“gaiji” module, a mark-up mechanism described in TEI
P5 which offers a means to represent and distinguish
specific characters and glyphs that the Unicode
Standard considers as identical (TEI Consortium,
2010).

3. Font-Based Option
Another possibility is to request users view the text
with a particular font, one that contains the appropriate
shape of the glyph(s). However, this is dependent upon
the user having a particular font installed.
Two recent developments affect this option:
1. A working group of W3C is developing a
specification for “WebFonts,” which will enable the
automatic downloading and temporary installment
of fonts over the Web, so users don’t need to
install fonts on their operating systems. WebFonts is
expected to be more widely deployed in the future;
a public working draft was published in late July
82

2010 (W3C, 2010). This would apply to viewing text
on Web browsers, and does not currently extend
to word processing documents. (Note: W3C also is
refining the CSS3 fonts module.)
2. A second development is the OpenType (OT)
specification, which permits alternate glyphs to
be selected and displayed (Microsoft Typography,
2008a). One drawback is that the person viewing
the document must be using an application that
supports these OT features in order for the specific
alternate glyphs to appear. If the application does
not support this OpenType feature, the default glyph
for the Unicode character will appear. For example,
the original author may have selected the shape
“β” for U+03B2 GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA for
his Greek text, but without the OpenType feature
support, the recipient’s application may display a
beta in the default shape, "ß".
OpenType also includes a way to specify specific
glyph shapes that are commonly used for certain
language-specific letters. For example, there are
specific forms of italic and cursive Serbian letters
that differ from Russian, although they are the
same Unicode characters. The OpenType “language
system” table and “locl” (localized form) feature table
are mechanisms that allow one to specify such variant
glyphs. These features are activated by language
tags (Microsoft Typography, 2008b). However, as
noted above, OpenType support – while becoming
more common - is still limited to certain applications,
although it is an international standard (ISO/IEC
14496-22:2009 [OFF] [ISO, 2011]).

4. Encode a Separate Character
One option occasionally mentioned as a way to
represent a particular variant in a standardized way
is to propose the variant as a separate character in
Unicode. Technically, this is not allowed, since one
of the core design principles is: “Unicode encodes
characters, not glyphs” (Unicode Consortium, 2011a).
However, some variants have been included in
Unicode if they were present in earlier standards. The
character/glyph model in CJK is particularly murky, in
part due to the sheer number of characters involved
(approximately 75,616 characters or 69% of all graphic
characters in Unicode 6.0 are CJK). For the historic
East Asian character sets, such as Classical Yi, the
writing systems may be poorly understood and there
is a tendency to encode glyphs. As a result, some
character proposals have been based on glyphs (cf.
the Classical Yi proposal, which proposed 88,613
“characters” [China, 2007]). Despite this, requesting

Digital Humanities 2011

the encoding of glyph variants into Unicode (as
separate characters) is not generally advisable.

5. Variation Sequence
A last option is to specify a Unicode variation sequence
which is defined as a base character and a variation
selector (Unicode Consortium, 2011b). This is a
standardized means to indicate the glyphic variants of
the base character. The advantage to this mechanism
is that the variation is accessible in plain text, and does
not rely on code points in the Private Use Area, which
are not interoperable.
This particular mechanism has not yet been widely
publicized amongst in the world of digital humanities. It
will likely become more widely supported in software,
particularly as the Japanese government will be using
variation sequences to handle rare ideographs used in
proper names and place names, rather than proposing
2,621 new “compatibility” characters (Japan , 2009).
In 2010, the Japan National Body put forward a large
collection of ideographic variation sequences, which
have been under review (Unicode Consortium, 2010a).
Variation selectors have been mentioned as a way
to handle variants for several historic scripts, namely
Tangut and Manichaean. For Tangut, a historic script
used in China until the 16c, the variation sequences
were suggested as a way to handle cases where
the lexical sources don’t agree (that is, there is
disagreement whether a given glyph is a variant of
a character or is a separate character), as a way
to document when different scholarly opinions on
unifications, and to address backwards compatibility
issues (Cook and Lunde, 2008).
In Manichaean, the variation selectors are mentioned
as a way to indicate alternate forms which are not
predictable, either by their position in a word, or in a
line. The use of the variation sequences maintains the
basic character identity (Everson et al., 2009).
Figure 1 is an example showing the proposed shape for
the Manichaean HE glyph, and the HE with Variation
Selector-1. (See Figure 1)
One drawback is that the variation sequences need
to be proposed and approved by the Unicode
Consortium, much as new characters are (or, for
ideographic sequences, are reviewed as part of the
Unicode Public Review Process). However, this hurdle
will ensure the characters are standardized, and
are publicly accessible (Unicode Editorial Committee
Members, 2011; Unicode Consortium, 2010b).

Another benefit is that search queries can ignore the
variation selectors or the query can be written to
only match a term with a specific variation selector.
This mechanism could be useful as a way to display
glyph errors, and be able to relate them to the base
character. However, if a given application does not
support variation sequences, the base character will
display by default.
Variation sequences provide a standards-based
option, which has some advantages over font-based
alternatives. However, to date, relatively few variation
sequences have been defined, except for those used in
mathematics, Mongolian, and the historic script PhagsPa (Unicode Editorial Committee Members, 2011).
At present, Ideographic Variation Sequences are
only supported in the certain environments (Acrobat/
Reader 9.0 and higher, Flash Player 10 and higher,
InDesign CS4 and higher, Mac OS X 10.6 and
higher, Windows 7 and higher, and Firefox 4 on
all platforms [Lunde, 2011]). The dependency on
limited implementations can pose a problem for digital
humanists, however, if future software fails to support
these variation sequences.

6. Conclusion
In sum, several alternatives are available to text
encoders to specify variant glyphs in text at present.
This paper has provided new information on different
options, which are still developing and may become
more widely adopted, affecting choices available to text
encoders.
This author cautiously recommends the use of
Variation Selectors if the glyph difference needs to be
captured in plain-text, and the digital encoder is willing
to go through the approval process to get the variation
sequence approved by the standards committees.

for the Humanities as part of the Universal Scripts
Project [#PW-50441].

1. Overview
In the past, humanities scholars have primarily
used text-based computational approaches to engage
questions of authorship. In the area of visual arts,
computational analysis of authorship is a growing
field, but it is one that features diverse questions and
requires complex algorithms, significant computational
resources and a wide variety of experts from diverse
disciplines to combine the results of visual inspections
with computer generated results. Furthermore, when
approaching the broad field of authorship-related
questions in visual works, the variety of digital images
representing cultural artifacts poses a formidable
challenge on the robustness and accuracy of computer
algorithms. The motivation of our work is to explore
technologies that facilitate enquiry about authorship in
visual art work and to address the challenges related
to algorithm development, computational scalability
of algorithms, distributed software development and
data sharing, efficient communication tools across
diverse disciplines, and robustness and general
utility of algorithmic development when applied to
a spectrum of authorship questions from historical
images. In other words, we wanted to develop
specific methods for new image-based research as
well as build and model for future work in image
processing and humanities research. We approached
these challenges by selecting image subsets from the
collections of 15th-century manuscripts, 17th and 18thcentury maps, and 19th through 21st-century quilts
85

Digital Humanities 2011

that often have corporate and anonymous authors
working in community groups, guilds, artisan shops,
and scriptoriums, and report technologies designed
to support authorship discoveries in these collections.
Crucially, the questions our algorithms and experts
address are concerned with using authorship as a
trope for analysis and generating new data, not just
verifying the heritage or identity of a given artifact.

2. Methodology
The research being presented as part of this paper
submission is derived from the Digging into Data to
Answer Authorship Related Questions Grant awarded
as part of the Digging into Data Challenge Competition
(www.diggingintodata.org). An international, multidisciplinary team of researchers from the University of
Illinois (US), the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (US), Michigan State University (US),
and the University of Sheffield (UK), the DID team
works to formulate and address the problem of
finding salient characteristics of artists from twodimensional (2D) images of historical artifacts. Given
a set of 2D images of historical artifacts with known
authors, our project teams aim to discover what
salient characteristics make an artist different from
others, and then to enable statistical learning about
individual and collective authorship. The objective
of this effort is to learn what is unique about the
style of each artist, and to provide the results at
a much higher level of confidence than previously
has been feasible by exploring a large search space
in the semantic gap of image understanding. Team
members are geographically distributed and have
very different backgrounds and expertise. While the
discoveries require involvements and interactions of
experts in computer science and in humanities, we
had to design a methodology for communicating,
coordinating web design and public relationship
interfaces, large size data sharing, collaborative
software development, software sharing and testing,
and hardware sharing. We approached this spectrum
of collaborative project challenges by (a) establishing
communication and coordination channels (ooVoo
videoconference, mailing lists, legal point of contacts
regarding licenses and intellectual properties), (b)
designing and deploying a content repository called
Medici, (c) designing and documenting a library
of content based file comparisons with standard
application programming interfaces (API) for software
development called Versus, (d) deploying software
source control and bug tracking systems accessible
to all team members (SVN and JIRA), (e) designing
web-based workflow systems that could give access
to hardware resources at any site for execution of
86

algorithms called Cyberintegrator, and (f) providing
additional tools and user interfaces for humanity
scholars to view large size images and contribute to
the interpretation of the computer generated results.

3. Technical Approach and Initial Results
Emphasizing
the
aspects
of
data-sharing,
collaborative software development, distributed
hardware resources, and interactions of experts from
diverse domains in the Digging into Data project,
we designed, developed and deployed technologies
supporting a wide spectrum of team activities. The
data, software and hardware sharing technologies
include the Medici Content Management Repository
(see Fig. 1),

Figure 1: User interface to the Medici management repository for
data sharing, annotations and visualization of large size images.

the Im2Learn library of basic image processing and
visualization algorithms that can be applied to various
image analyses (see Fig. 2),

Digital Humanities 2011

based on a comparison operation, we have designed
additional API called Versus which allows everyone
to contribute with comparison methods. Once the
algorithms for image analyses and comparisons
have been developed, they can be integrated into
workflows (a sequence of algorithmic operations to
reach the analytical goal) in Cyberintegrator workflow
environment. Cyberintegrator is a user friendly editor
to several middleware software components that:
1. enable users to easily include tools and data sets
into a software/data unifying environment
2. annotate data, tools and workflows with metadata
3. visualize data and metadata
4. share data and tools using local and remote context
repository
5. execute step-by-step workflows during scientific
explorations
6. gather provenance information
executions and data creations.

and the Cyberintegrator workflow for managing
computations on distributed computational resources.
The Medici Content Repository System is a web and
desktop-enabled content management system that
allows users to upload, collate, annotate, and run
analytics on a variety of files types allowing for portable
and open representation of data with extensible
analytical tools. The analytical capabilities come from
the Im2learn library that provides a plug-and-play
interface for adding new algorithms and tools. Due to
the fact that the authorship questions are frequently

In order to support visual explorations of large
size images and contribute to the interpretation of
the computer generated results by humanists and
computer scientists, we have also integrated Microsoft
Live Lab’s Seadragon library to build image pyramids
and support fast zoom in and out operations.

4. Summary
Our paper addressed each logistical and
computational facet of a distributed, international
collaboration. Based on our initial effort, all
team members have responded positively to the
technologies introduced and also helped in defining
requirements for executing such complex projects
involving collaborative humanities research. Based
on our current observations, the web technologies
for data, software and hardware sharing provided
the foundation blocks for addressing the authorship
discovery challenges. We have also concluded that the
open nature of joint software development is necessary
for overcoming intellectual property right and other
legal hurdles.

1. Introduction
Linguistics is facing the challenge of many other
sciences as it continues to grow into increasingly
complex subfields, each with its own separate or
overarching branches. While linguists are certainly
aware of the overall structure of the research field, they
cannot follow all developments other than those of their
subfields. It is thus important to help specialists but
also newcomers alike to bushwhack through evolved
or unknown territory of linguistic data.
A considerable amount of research data in linguistics
is described with metadata. While studies described
and published in archived journals and conference
proceedings receive a quite homogeneous set of
metadata tags — e.g., author, title, publisher —, this
does not hold for the empirical data and analyses that
underlie such studies. Moreover, lexicons, grammars,
experimental data, and other types of resources come
in different forms; and to make things worse, their
description in terms of metadata is also not uniform, if
existing at all.
These problems are well-known and there are
now a number of international initiatives — e.g.,
CLARIN, FlareNet, MetaNet, DARIAH — to build
infrastructures for managing linguistic resources. The
NaLiDa project, funded by the German Research
Foundation, aims at facilitating the management and
88

access to linguistic resources originating from German
research institutions. In cooperation with the German
SFB 833 research center, we are developing a
combination of faceted and full-text search to give
integrated access through heterogeneous metadata
sets. Our approach is supported by a central registry
for metadata field descriptors, and a component
repository for structured groups of data categories as
larger building blocks.

2. State of Affairs
An increasing number of research institutions in
linguistics is systematically archiving research data
and making such data publicly available. Users can
access such archives via institution-specific websites
or purpose-built software where resources can be
searched and, in part, downloaded. Some institutions
provide access to their archives via OAI-PMH so that
the archives’ public content can be harvested and
fed into the metadata services of data centers in the
community.
The metadata provided by the various institutions
differ not only in quantity and quality but also in the
format of description, as Fig. 1 illustrates. Typically,
a research organization designs a metadata schema
that it deems to serve best its institutional setting
and the number and types of resources it hosts.
Different organizations will likely yield various schemas
with their own structure and terminology for the
schemas’ nodes. Such semantic heterogeneity may be
complemented by syntactic heterogeneity as formats
may vary (e.g., ASCII, relational database format,
XML). An organization’s resources can thus be seen
as a forest of trees of the same kind, whereas a tree
— i.e., a description of one resource — may have
deformations at the leafs as the result of not adhering
to the schema. Moreover, trees will look rather naked
when resources are described sparsely.

Figure 1: Metadata heterogeneity

3. Conceptual Setting
While we expect research organizations to continue
managing their research data in their respective
ways, we ask them (i) to make their data public

Digital Humanities 2011

in a well-defined XML format to obtain syntactic
uniformity, and (ii) to reformulate their schemas to
adhere to CMDI (Component MetaData Infrastructure),
see (Broeder et al. 2010), a component-based
metadata model that makes use of predefined
metadata components and the ISOcat data category
registry (International Organization of Standardization
2009). The organizations’ archive managers have the
opportunity to redefine existing parts of their schema,
but they can also choose to keep existing structures
and terminologies. In this case the respective
metadata descriptors need to be associated with their
corresponding semantic points of references in ISOcat,
being addressable via unique persistent identifiers.
Moreover, archive managers can add new data
categories to ISOcat’s private space for immediate
availability, and initiate a standardization process to
pave the way for their wider use.

4. Technological Setting

4.1. Metadata Storage
The storage of resource descriptions has to cope
with a multitude of schemas the descriptions adhere
to. The use of a relational database would require
a mapping of all schemas to a single one, which is
all but trivial. Instead, with CouchDB [http://couch
db.apache.org], a no-SQL database is being used
that stores arbitrarily structured documents rather than
records of some fixed form. The translation between
the XML-based CMDI-format into CouchDB’s native
JSON format is structure-and information-preserving.

to partition the search space into larger units,
whereas open vocabularies induce larger search
space fragmentations.
Once faceted search has focused on a subset of
resources, conditional facets allow the introduction
of additional context-specific navigational user aids.
When users select the facet “resourceType” with value
“tool”, for instance, they restrict the search space to
just encompass metadata that describes languageprocessing tools. Here, the conditional facet “toolType”
is introduced that partitions the remaining search
space according to the type of tool, e.g., language
parser, spell checker. Moreover, conditional facets
help lowering the complexity of computing search
space clusters and their intersections.

4.3. Mapping Facets to Nodes of the Various
Schemas
Metadata schemas vary in structure and terminology.
Different names for nodes or leafs may be used to
elicit the same meaning, and identical names may be
used for semantically different concepts. This makes
the mapping of facets to nodes of the various tree
types (cf. Fig. 2) rather difficult, and usually requires
some intricate knowledge of the metadata forests
to be processed. When schemas make use of the
aforementioned data category registry ISOcat, such
ambiguities can be resolved automatically as names
are linked to registry entries.

4.2. Faceted Search
Facets serve to blaze the trail. Faceted search
enables a user to find specific trees, i.e., resource
descriptions, in the various forests by specifying
(some of) their common properties. A facet partitions
the search space where descriptions, i.e., CouchDB
documents, in the same cluster share the same facet
value. The selection of multiple facets corresponds to
an intersection of clusters identifying resources that
have all selected facet values. Faceted search also
supplies a user with information about the number
of documents in each cluster or intersections thereof
— the “mileage” of following a trail. In the presently
available data the following unconditional facets are
adequate for the various schemas describing linguistic
resources: “organization”, “modality”, “language”,
“country”, “resourceType”, and “origin”. Facet values
may stem from open or controlled vocabularies;
controlled vocabulary facets have a stronger tendency

Figure 2: Mapping facets to the
individual parts of the resource trees

Each facet corresponds to an elementary CouchDB
view into the database of resource documents. These
views serve as a starting point for the generation
of complex views that correspond to the various
possible navigational paths using facet selection,
thus implementing the faceted browser back-end.
89

Digital Humanities 2011

Elementary views and complex views are generated
automatically from a facet specification file, an
enriched textual encoding of the table in Fig. 2.

4.4. Full-text Search Support
Data sets may have resources that are hard to find
using faceted search alone. This is true for resources
with sparse metadata, or with descriptors that can
rarely be mapped to facets. We are therefore using
CouchDB’s port to Lucene to perform full-text search
across all resources or search spaces restricted by
prior faceted search.

4.5. Front-end
Fig. 3 depicts a screenshot of the NaLiDa faceted
browser; it shows a search state where users selected
three facets (“country”, “modality”, “resourceType”)
and where the system displays an overview of the
remaining search space in terms of the facets, the
number of resources available for each of their values,
and access to all documents selected so far.

main advantages: CouchDB also stores the metadata
documents (with varying schemas) and thus also
serves as permanent storage; the use of conditional
facets contributes to usability as only relevant
facets are shown, guiding users’ navigation; index
generation accommodates for incremental updates
on the metadata sets, supporting regular harvesting
without recomputing all indices and views anew;
and the faceted browser’s back-end is generated
automatically from a facet specification and can be
configured easily for other datasets.

Lurking in Museums: In Support
of Passive Participation
Smith Bautista, Susana

susanesm@usc.edu
University of Southern California

Lurking is a term that has gained popularity with
the advent of online communities. Museums are
no exception to this renewed interest in community
building, both online and onsite. The Internet has
helped museums to better serve their communities,
connecting physical events and exhibitions with
online services, information, and activities. The
greater museum community is compartmentalized
into different groups, including educators, scholars,
teenagers, families and more, but their dues-paying
members are perhaps the closest to what is more
commonly known as affinity spaces (James Gee)
or knowledge-sharing communities of practice (CoP).
Many of the membership groups organize events at
the museum, raise funds for the museum, socialize
regularly, and even have online profiles, blogs,
or pages on social media sites. The term lurking
has arisen because online communities have high
expectations for their members to participate and
contribute, in particular with online games and chat
forums. The web usability expert Jakob Nielsen
(2006) proposed the well-known 90-9-1 rule of user
participation in online communities, which states that
90% of users are lurkers, 9% of users contribute
from time to time, and 1% of users account for
most contributions. The more passive acts of being
present (virtually or physically), listening, watching,
and reading – that is, lurking – are considered
negative when contrasted to the more dynamic acts
of writing, contributing information, performing tasks,
or discourse that are all viewed as essential to
the formation and maintenance of community. Even
the spectatorial can be considered negatively, as
in voyeurism that is often perceived as leading to
perverse and criminal acts.
Analogous to the conventional concept of community
is the idea of a social network as a system of individual
nodes that are all related, first proposed by J. A. Barnes
in the early 1950s. The concept of the network society
has been best developed by Manuel Castells (2000,
p. 12) who states that, “The ability of an actor in the
network – be it a company, individual, government,
or other organization – to participate in the network

is determined by the degree to which the node can
contribute to the goals of the network… This leads to
a binary process of inclusion and exclusion from the
network. The people at the bottom are those who, with
nothing to offer the network, are excluded.” Similar to
lurking but more related to economics is the free rider
problem, as it can be argued that every community –
regardless of its size or nature – offers a public good
and is based upon some type of exchange system.
Art museums are spaces that have traditionally
encouraged lurking, as visitors are invited to leisurely
appreciate works of art in a reverent environment that
prioritizes observation, contemplation, learning, and
personal interpretation. There are some exceptions,
however, such as with participatory art practices that
gained prominence in the early 1960s and continue to
be exhibited in museums today, dependent on visitors’
active participation for their realization. Museums have
entered the digital age just as have other traditional
socio-cultural institutions, and consequently they are
incorporating new technologies for the purposes of
facilitating exhibition, interpretation, education, and
participation. The modern museum presumes that
visitors – especially younger ones (digital natives) –
expect a more interactive museum experience that
allows them to actively participate and even share
their opinions within a community that is becoming
perceptibly less hierarchical and authoritarian. New
technologies offer tremendous possibilities for all
visitors to engage more deeply with art, but they can
also distract from the passive acts of contemplation
and observation if they demand too much physical
interaction. Nevertheless, art museums remain a
trusted and respected place in which to observe, think,
feel, and learn. This paper will assert that lurking is a
necessary and useful part of community engagement
and learning in the digital age, and that art museums
are a valuable and unique space for such activity.
Some specific technologies used by art museums
today will be discussed in the context of whether they
promote a more active or passive experience. A critical
distinction must also be made, however, between the
terms interaction and participation, the latter of which
is more open-ended than the former.
In writing about participatory culture and the digital
age, many scholars such as Henry Jenkins and Mikuzo
Ito discuss the importance of participation amongst
youth while also stressing the importance of other
skills, characteristics, and stages of learning that could
easily be construed as lurking. We understand from
Richard Bartle’s (1996) taxonomy, D.T. Schaller et al.’s
(2007) four learning preferences, and Ito et al.’s (2008)
three genres, that there are many ways to engage
91

Digital Humanities 2011

in activities, including both play and learning. The
more active forms include creating, producing, sharing,
contributing, playing, and commenting. These forms
of participation are the most visible to the community
and as such, are most prized in that they serve
as an example for other members to emulate. More
passive forms include listening, reading, watching, and
browsing, as well as the introspective acts of thinking,
reflecting, evaluating, and forming opinions. When
these passive acts are shared with other individuals,
discourse arises (physical or virtual), which can then
be considered a more active and public form of
participation. Different personalities also emerge within
groups, and more active contributors will try to lead
others less inclined to participate. Jenkins et al. (2008,
p. 7) assert that, “In such a world [participatory culture],
many will only dabble, some will dig deeper, and
still others will master the skills that are most valued
within the community.” This paper will show that all
types of participation are essential to the development
and maintenance of communities. The formation of
knowledge and learning is a linear process that begins
with more introspective and often individual acts, which
in many instances then become public when thoughts,
creations, and knowledge are shared with others.
If thoughts are not shared and knowledge remains
private, then the learning process merely continues
with the individual.
The negative implications of lurking arise mostly from
within the communities themselves. What cultural
communities tend to forget, however, is that lurkers
play an important role; they provide an audience, they
carefully observe community norms and practices, and
they contemplate and interpret that which they observe
to perhaps share later with others. Performers do not
want to perform without an audience, writers do not
want to write books that nobody reads, and museums
cannot open without visitors. Certainly, artists have
a personal drive to create that does not require
an audience or even a client, but even the most
dedicated artist desires feedback, validation, or public
acknowledgment. Physical spaces and organizations
have long measured success in quantitative terms of
the number of seats filled, visitors through the front
door, or books or tickets sold. Online spaces are no
different; the success of websites are most commonly
measured by the number of clicks, page views, or
downloads, rather than the more interactive number
of comments, links, or uploads. As Web 2.0 features
become more common on websites, these interactive
metrics will surely begin to matter more. Still the
number of people “passively” watching, reading, and
listening are a strong measure of success, as well

92

as a strong incentive for creators, organizations, and
funders alike.
Museums need to protect the act of lurking.
Any expectation of active participation, interaction,
and sharing may inhibit lurkers from eventually
participating, for lurkers need not be defined as
having rigid characteristics but rather as representing
merely one stage in the long process of learning
and civic engagement. In its recent report Museums
& Society 2034: Trends and Potential Futures, the
American Association of Museums (2008, p. 19) states
that, “While technological progress has brought much
value to society, one byproduct of these emergent
structural shifts in communication technologies is
almost certainly going to be a world with fewer and
fewer places where the public can find respite and
retreat.” Through their expertly researched and curated
exhibitions and related public programming, museums
are best able to teach their visitors and members how
to observe, how to critically think, and how to develop
opinions in order to more effectively act on them if
so desired. They can also teach the value of being
an audience within a socially networked environment,
which is the first step to recognizing the importance of
community and public goods. This paper will discuss
how museums might continue to encourage lurking
in synergy with new digital technologies, and likewise
how youth can become empowered to not only act,
but also to observe and contemplate. As Jenkins et al.
surmise (2008, p. 39), “…knowing how to act within
the distributed knowledge system is more important
than learning content. Because content is something
that can be ‘held’ by technologies such as databases,
websites, wikis, and so forth, the curricular focus is
on learning how to generate, evaluate, interpret, and
deploy data.” Those who lurk in museums (online
or physically) are not evading their role; they do
have a very important role within their community and
within the process of acquiring, forming and sharing
knowledge, and even more so in the participatory
culture of the digital age.

the Usage of Language

highlighted using brighter formatting. Therefore bright,
large collocates are likely to be of interest, whereas
dark, small collocates perhaps less so.

Beavan, David

3. Comparison

1. Introduction

Louw introduced us to semantic prosody, which
describes how synonymous words can actually take
on positive or negative connotations. A natural way to
investigate this would be to separately compare the
collocates of each node word of interest. This can be
performed by looking at multiple collocate clouds side
by side, or by using statistical tools presenting tabular
data. While these methods may be best suited to the
comparison of many node words of interest, ComPair
provides a solution to the comparison of two words,
while keeping true to the aims of collocate clouds.

David.Beavan@glasgow.ac.uk
University of Glasgow, United Kingdom

This paper will demonstrate ComPair, a new tool to
investigate and compare word usage, encouraging
new ways to explore language variation. While
remaining focussed on the usability and the promotion
of navigation, this tool represents an evolutionary step
forward from the author’s previous award winning
visualisation applications. This paper will introduce
the methods and technologies at its core, perform a
demonstration of the tool and discuss opportunities for
further collaboration.

2. Collocation

Semantic prosody is illustrated in figure 2, comparing
the collocates of ‘utterly’ vs. ‘absolutely’. Negative
terms cluster near ‘utterly’ where as positive terms
cling to ‘absolutely’. At face value these words are
synonymous, but they are clearly used in different
contexts and are not simply interchangeable. These
are often issues which challenge learners of English as
a foreign language.

Firth in 1957 tells us ‘You shall know a word by the
company it keeps’ leading to a contextual investigation
of language which remains with us today. Identifying
a word of interest and examining its collocates, often
tells us more than a traditional dictionary definition
ever could. Traditional corpus tools display collocates
in tabular format, providing rich statistical data at
the expense of giving the user an opportunity to
see the overall linguistic landscape. Tools such as
Beavan’s Collocate Clouds present this information
very differently, visualising the collocates in cloud form,
as in figure 1.
Figure 2. ComPair visualisation of ‘utterly’
vs. ‘absolutely’ in the British National Corpus

4. Method

Figure 1. Collocate Cloud of node word ‘stars’ [http://
www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/corpus/bnc/collocatecloud.php?
word=stars (accessed 1 November 2010)]

A collocate, if known, can be quickly located due
to the alphabetical nature of the display. Frequently
occurring collocates stand out, as they are shown in
a larger typeface, with collocationally strong pairings

ComPair calculates the collocates of both node words,
ranking the results using a combination of frequency of
co-occurrence, and by collocational strength (adopting
the Mutual Information (MI) measure). A continuum is
formed, with each extremity representing the separate
node words (imagine a piece of string, with a label
representing each search term at each end). The
collocates are then distributed along this continuum,
using the relative pull of collocational strength towards
each node (the words near the end of the string are

93

Digital Humanities 2011

strongly associated with those end labels, those in the
centre much less so).

5. Visualisation
ComPair displays this continuum, displaying each
node word and the collocates between them. The
display uses a spectrum of colour, to further enforce
the ordering of the collocates. In the MI tug of war, the
words in the centre share similar MI scores with each
input term. Typically these are fairly low MI figures and
appear green. In the ‘utterly’ vs. ‘absolutely’ example
above ‘ridiculous’ appears in pink, this indicates that
while the MI scores (utterly- ridiculous’ vs. absolutelyridiculous) are roughly the same, they are much higher
than the surrounding collocates. Ridiculous is therefore
a word used strongly with both utterly and absolutely.
Those collocates appearing close to each node, and
sharing its colour are used very strongly with that
node word, and only that word. Figure 2 tells us that
things can be ‘absolutely marvellous’ but not ‘utterly
marvellous’. In comparison, someone can be ‘utterly
ruthless’, but not ‘absolutely ruthless’.

6. Future Directions
At present ComPair allows for the comparison of
two separate words in a single corpus. One possible
extension would be the facility to search for the same
words across two corpora. Imagine two corpora of
differing political parties. With a single search term,
ComPair would help expose the views and attitudes
towards that concept. Another avenue would contrast
word usage in British vs. American English.
Other applications would involve its use as a learning
tool, allowing users to go beyond dictionaries and
thesauri, to see in detail how different words actually
operate. Visualisation of more than two node words
should also be possible given different display
techniques.

This paper will present a critical analysis of our
attempts to build Virtual Research Environments
(VREs) for everyday Humanities research tasks
using digital archives. Numerous specialised VREs
have been developed for addressing particular tasks
in various humanities disciplines. The Silchester
VREs addressed data integration in archaeological
excavations, the SDM VRE developed services for
sharing and annotating manuscripts, while TEXTvre is
concerned with TEI-based resource creation. Building
on these experiences, gMan addressed the issue
of moving beyond support for specific, focused
tasks, and instead building services to enable more
general-purpose humanities research activities, such
as integrating and organising the heterogeneous
and often unstructured digital resources, and support
for ‘active reading’ processes1 through advanced
discovery facilities. Such services regularly top the
list of humanities user requirements2. This paper
describes work to this end, firstly by the DARIAH
project, and subsequently consolidated by the gMan
project, funded by JISC’s VRE Rapid Innovation
programme.

These experiments were based on use cases
identified by the earlier LaQuAT (Linking and Querying
Ancient Texts) project3, which investigated how to
integrate scattered, heterogeneous and autonomous
data resources relating to ancient texts, mainly
databases but also XML corpora. LaQuAT attempted
to solve these issues by offering an integration
framework based on the OGSA-DAI grid middleware,
which provided an integrated interface to the various
data resources that followed a relational database
model. However, this approach had certain limitations
for our purposes, as such models are optimised
for dealing with datacentric resources - that is,
resources consisting primarily of structured data such
as numbers, dates or very short text fields - rather than
text-centric resources containing significant quantities
of unstructured text. The approach worked well where
the structural context of the information was clear and
the query aimed at exact matches. More commonly,
however, humanities researchers work with textcentric resources, perhaps enhanced with XML markup to capture document structure and additional
metadata4, and they look for resources for further
investigation based on looser criteria of relevance, e.g.
by searching for all Roman legal texts in one resource
containing information on punishments that are also
mentioned in papyri from another resource.
These conclusions were further elaborated in the
use cases that were developed from them, which
are the main drivers for the work described here.
Complementing this is a body of methodological
investigation concerning scholars and their use of
sources, particularly their use of data and archives.
Before describing our current work, we will survey
briefly these investigations.
The difference in scholarly practices between the
sciences and the mainstream humanities is highlighted
in a study5 that investigated the types of information
sources used in different humanities disciplines, based
on results from the US Research Libraries Group
reports. Structured data is relatively little used, except
in some areas of historical research, and data as it
is traditionally understood in the sciences, e.g. the
results of measurements, even less so. It is true
that the study is partly outdated, and that data in
the traditional sense is increasingly important in the
humanities, particularly in linguistics and archaeology
where scientific techniques have been widely adopted.
Nevertheless, it is clear that in general humanities
research relies not on measurements as a source of
authority, but rather on the provenance of sources
and peer-assessment, and that what data repositories
are for the sciences, archives are for the humanities6.
95

Digital Humanities 2011

Archival records are primary sources about the past
and may take many forms, including government
papers, financial documents, photographs, sound
recordings, etc. All this information is unstructured in
nature.
Thus, our work is driven partly by the requirements
from7, interpreted so as to relate to methods of
research in archives. Retrieval is to happen in real time,
and traditional finding aids are to be complemented
by more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms, including
the ability to create relevance indexes on unstructured
resources, as well as the ability to combine resources
in new ways. In particular, we aimed to implement the
personal copy of a finding aid that is often quoted as
an important prerequisite for specialised research in
archives.
Our work investigated how (digital) archival content
can be delivered to humanities researchers more
effectively, independently of the location and
implementation of that content, and with special
facilities provided for customising the retrieval,
management and manipulation of the content. We
investigated how the UK and European research
infrastructure (RI) can be exploited to support datadriven, collaborative research in the humanities by
using the gCube environment8, which was developed
by the EU-funded D4Science project. gCube allows
virtual research communities to deploy VREs on
demand by making use of the shared resources
of the European RI, and provides services that
match closely the sort of information organisation and
retrieval activities that we identified as being typical in
humanities research.
D4Science provides an easy way of scavenging online
data resources. It has a consistent mechanism to
import data for rich user interaction within the deployed
VREs. Its data resource staging framework, based on a
well-defined workflow of data analysis, data modelling
and data generation, is one of the key innovations of
D4Science. The analysis and modelling phases define
how data collections are loaded into gCube compound
objects using its simple but powerful data model. In
the data generation phase, descriptive metadata and
provenance information are added.
Using the gCube data staging framework, the following
datasets were brought together in our experiments:
- The Heidelberger Gesamtverzeichnis (HGV) der
griechischen Papyrusurkunden Aegyptens, a
collection of metadata records for 65,000 Greek
papyri from Egypt.

96

- Projet Volterra, a database of Roman legal texts,
currently in the low tens of thousands but very much
in progress, stored in a series of themed tables in
Microsoft Access.
- The Inscriptions of Aphrodisias, a corpus of about
2,000 ancient Greek
These datasets were the same as those used in
the LaQuAT project and thus and allow a critical
comparison of results. They overlap in terms of time,
places and people – specifically looking at the first five
centuries or so of the Roman Empire – although their
contents are otherwise quite different. The provision
of an environment for working with this data in
an integrated form would be highly fruitful for the
researcher.
The presentation will describe the use cases that
we used for evaluating gCube. Our approach was to
break down the scenarios identified in interviews at
KCL and within DARIAH into a number of common,
atomic actions. Specific instances of these actions
can be combined to model a variety of "real"
research scenarios, for example the ability to assemble
heterogeneous resources (or parts of resources) into
a virtual collection, to share this virtual collection
within a specific community and to search across a
virtual collection, where specific search parameters
(such as the importance of specific locations) can
be set according to preference. Specific communities
also require specific search services such as georeferenced and date-range searches. Finally, the
researcher wants to share links between research
objects and annotations (including related documents
publications) in her community.
In our experiments, we confirmed that most of these
use cases could be supported by the features already
provided by the core D4Science systems. For the
Digital Humanities 2011 presentation, we will address
our subsequent activities: the analysis that we carried
out to identify gaps in the existing service provision;
some results that demonstrate a clear distinction
between the viewpoints of humanities and science
research, in respect of such features as image search;
our move to develop gMan as a production service
for humanities researchers; and the recently-funded
European Holocaust Research Infrastructure project,
which aims to integrate Holocaust research material
from archives across Europe. The main aim of the
project will be to make accessible existing Holocaust
research collections but the second priority will be to
deploy virtual research environments to make use of
these resources. D4Science services were seen to
support initial requirements well.

Topic Modeling Historical
Sources: Analyzing the Diary of
Martha Ballard
Blevins, Cameron
cblevins@stanford.edu
Stanford University

In 1991, historian Laurel Ulrich’s A Midwife’s
Tale swept a little-known 18th-century midwife
named Martha Ballard into the national historical
consciousness. Ulrich’s work centered on the analysis
of nearly 10,000 diary entries penned by Ballard
between 1785 and 1812, leading to an exploration
of issues such as shifting family structures, the
professionalization of obstetrics, and debtor patterns in
a rural economy (Ulrich 1991). My research examines
the same diary, but instead of a traditional close
reading of the source, I use topic modeling to mine
a digitized transcription, iterating through hundreds
of thousands of words in order to search for textual
patterns.
One of the fundamental challenges to applying text
processing techniques to historical sources is one of
data quality. Older, hand-written documents are often
difficult to transcribe into a digital format, while the
shorthand style of diary writing is often filled with
abbreviations and misspellings. For instance, Ballard
employs a vocabulary peppered with variations: the
word “daughter” is spelled fourteen different ways:
“daught,” “dagt,” “dat,” etc. One way to overcome
this challenge is to use topic modeling, a method of
computational linguistics that attempts to group words
together based on their appearance in the text.
My short paper session focuses on an analysis of a
historical source using topic modeling (Blei and Lafferty
2009). As a form of linguistic analysis, topic modeling
has been employed over the past several years to
examine large-scale, multi-author textual databases,
including historical newspapers (Block 2006), journal
articles (Gerrish et al. 2010, Hall et. al. 2008),
and social network data (Ramage et al. 2010). My
application of topic modeling differs from many of these
investigations by focusing on multiple, short texts by a
single author: in this case, Ballard’s diary entries.
I employed the machine learning toolkit MALLET
(McCallum 2002) in order to topic model each of
Ballard’s entries as separate pieces of text. MALLET,
identified thirty topics, which I then labeled for clarity.
97

Digital Humanities 2011

The following sample topics were some of the most
coherent (my own labels in bold and uppercase):

Figure 1

This approach also can chart patterns over the course
of the diary, which covers the final twenty-seven years
of Ballard’s life. Two topics tended to involve words
related to HOUSEWORK. Aggregated by year, they
demonstrate a steady increase in the frequency with
which Ballard writes about daily chores ( Figure 2).

Topics

Although topic modeling was useful for overcoming
some of the challenges of spelling variations, its real
value lies in its ability to quantitatively measure the
relative thematic content of each piece of text. In the
case of Ballard’s diary, MALLET assumes that each
diary entry is compromised of some combination of
thirty topics. An entry in which Ballard attended a
sermon and purchased supplies from the general store
might contain, for instance, scores of 50% for the
CHURCH topic, 25% for the SHOPPING topic, and
minimal or zero scores for the remaining twenty-eight
topics. Associated temporal metadata (day, month,
year, day of the week) allowed me to chart the behavior
of certain topics over time.
As a simple barometer of its effectiveness, I used
one of the generated topics that I labeled COLD
WEATHER, which included words such as cold, windy,
chilly, snowy, and air. Aggregating its entry scores by
month shows exactly what one would expect over the
course of a year ( Figure 1).

98

Figure 2

Both topics moved in tandem and steadily increased
as she grew older (excepting a curious divergence in
the last several years of the diary). This is somewhat
counter-intuitive, as one would assume the household
responsibilities for an aging grandmother with a large
family would decrease over time. Yet this pattern
bolsters the argument made by Ulrich in A Midwife’s
Tale, in which she points out that the first half of
the diary was “written when her family’s productive
power was at its height.” (Ulrich 1991, pp. 285) As her
children married and moved into different households,
and her own husband experienced mounting legal and
financial troubles, her daily burdens around the house
increased. Topic modeling quantifies and visualizes
this pattern, one not immediately visible to a human
reader.

Digital Humanities 2011

Topic modeling allows for patterns to crystallize that
are imperceptible to a human reader. One topic was
particularly intriguing, and included the words: feel
husband unwel warm feeble felt god great fatagud
fatagued thro life time year dear rose famely bu good
These were words that seem to cover EMOTION
and spiritual reflection – an abstract topic that is
difficult enough for a human reader to describe. Yet
the computer did a remarkable job in identifying
a cohesive group of words. The topic follows a
fascinating trajectory in Ballard’s diary ( Figure 3).

Not only did Ballard write about this topic more as she
grew older, but there was a dramatic leap from 1803 to
1804-1805. This corresponds quite well to the period of
intense family travail: Her husband was imprisoned for
debt and her son was indicted by a grand jury for fraud,
causing a cascade effect in Martha’s own life. Topic
modeling not only reveals the trajectory of tangible
themes (housework, births, gardening, etc.), but also
begins to quantify and visualize abstract themes by
charting Ballard’s emotional state of being.

My short paper session focuses on the results
of my existing work on topic modeling Ballard’s
diary while outlining some of the future paths this
research could take. In particular, I am interested
in pairing trends in topics with trends in Ballard’s
social network. What topics correlate with what kinds
of people? Are women or men described alongside
particular themes? In what broad context do ministers,
doctors, neighbors, or family members appear? In
conjunction with traditional research and analysis,
topic modeling presents a valuable methodology for
examining historical sources.

Cinemetrics (www.cinemetrics.lv) is a collaborative,
online tool to enable researchers to collect, store, and
process scholarly data about film editing. The longterm goal of the project is to create an extensive, multifaceted collection of freely accessible digital data on
film editing - a digital laboratory for the study of film
style. Over the last four years, over 600 individuals
have contributed editing data on circa 6,900 films to the
project. Our paper at DH2011 will focus on the types
of film historical questions Cinemetrics can address
today. In addition, we’ll provide a brief overview of how
the software and the collaborative submission works,
compare our work with similar efforts, and finally offer
an early look at future directions for development.
At present, Cinemetrics is programmed handle the
aspect of editing known in film studies as cutting
rates. Though we tend to perceive their unfolding
as continuous most films consist of segments called
shots that are separated by instant breaks called cuts.
Shots differ in terms of space and in terms of time.
We know enough about space-related distinctions
between shots, which are easy to name (shot 1: baby
playing; shot 2: man looking) and categorize (shot
1: medium long high angle shot; shot 2: facial close
up). Time-related differences between shots are more
elusive and harder to talk about for; unlike in music or
poetry with their scaled feet and measures, variations
in shot length are not ones of distinction but of degree.
Shot lengths are sometimes convenient to present as
the frequency of shot changes, or cuts, hence the term
"cutting rates.” Shorter shots mean a higher cutting
rate. Unsurprisingly, cutting rates are linked to the story
and its space-time articulations; likewise, montage
sequences meant to cover larger spaces of story time
have higher cutting rates than sequences shown in

100

real time. Less evident, but just as important, is the
relationship between cutting rates and the history of
film. This is this gap in our knowledge that Cinemetrics
is designed to bridge.
Using Cinemetrics, we are able to obtain and present
cutting-related data in a more flexible way than
previously available. Rather than calculate average
shot lengths (ASL) arithmetically, Cinemetrics records
and stores the time-span of each separate shot.
Distinct from the arithmetical ASL, which is a single
datum, Cinemetrics treats each film as a database of
shots and highlights its individual features. Specifically,
it tells us about a film's cutting swing (standard
deviations of shorter and longer shots from ASL),
its cutting range (difference in seconds between the
shortest and the longest shot of the film), and its
dynamic profiles (polynomial trendlines that reflect
fluctuations of shot lengths within the duration of the
film). In the “Articles” section of our site are links
to articles by a number of film scholars on movie
measurement studies using Cinemetrics.
The Cinemetrics database is an open-submission
repository of data collected by people who use the
client tool. All raw research data submitted to the site
is freely available to anyone. The database's default
sorting is alphabetic by film titles, but it can also be
sorted by other parameters such as year, submitter's
name, submission date, simple vs. advanced mode
of measuring, and by the film's average shot length,
median shot length, and standard deviation. By clicking
on a film, title the user can access the page that
provides basic statistics and interactive graphs related
to this film.
"Cinemetrics Lab" is the latest addition to our site, and
a work in progress. It is envisaged to offer the students
of film history a range of analytical tools that will help
them dissect, visualize, and compare film-related data.
We started with a large-scale comparative map that
looks a little like a star map. It is a scatter graph, and
each dot represents a film available on our database.
If you find your film on this map, you will instantly see
how it relates to thousands of other films on the x-axis
on time (111 years of film history) and on the y-axis of
average shot lengths.
While Cinemetrics has no clones, there are a
number of projects pursuing similar goals that
complement our efforts. Jeremy Butler's useful
"Shot Logger" (www.tcf.ua.edu/slgallery/shotlogger/)
features a database of films (mainly TV) and
offers statistics "inspired by Cinemetrics", but its
database is still small, and the seven statistics
values the site yields are numerically, not

Digital Humanities 2011

graphically, expressed. The francophone site "Lignes
de Temps" (web.iri.centrepompidou.fr/pop_site.html),
linked to the Georges Pompidou Center for Modern Art
in Paris is mainly designed as a video-flow annotation
and cut-detection tool.

The Digital Archaeological
Record--an Analytic Data
Repository for Archaeology

The above-mentioned "Shotlogger," "Edit 2000,"
and especially "Research into Film" are three
sites on which Cinemetrics activities are actively
echoed or discussed. Nick Redfern's "Research into
Film" (nickredfern.wordpress.com/) uses Cinemetrics
data to theorize statistical approaches to film
studies. "Edit 2000" (www.data2000.no/EDIT2000/),
launched in Norway in 2009, was made to represent
Edit Decision List (EDL) files as numeric and
visual summaries. Another group whose researchers
deployed Cinemetrics raw data for their experiments
in data visualization is "Software Studies Initiative"
headed by Prof. Lev Manovich at UC San Diego. The
site shows how Cinemetrics data can be variously
represented using different visualization tools.

In the past 150 years, the discipline of archaeology
has changed dramatically; excavation procedures,
field methods, and record keeping have both
improved and become formalized. Ahead of the
digital era, the physical records of an excavation
(the papers, data tables, journals, and monographs)
were preserved as artifacts alongside the excavated
materials in museums and repositories. More recently,
Archaeologists have been quick to adopt new
technology from punch cards in the 1960s to
spreadsheets, databases, GIS, and 3D scanning. Yet,
these modern files, images, data sets, and documents,
if not properly preserved, are more fragile than the
objects they describe. With the Digital Archaeological
Record (tDAR --http://www.tdar.org), we hope to
change this.
tDAR was designed as a domain-specific digital
repository, focused on preservation of, and access
to archaeological documents, reports, data sets and
images. The most successful digital repositories
provide additional value to their users beyond the
core mission of preservation. Examples including
ArXiv (http://arxiv.org/) or the University of Rochester's
digital repository (https://urresearch.rochester.edu)
are successful because of additional factors such as
reputation or community. For tDAR, the additional
value is created through research tools developed on
top of the repository. These tools aim to promote new
synthetic and comparative research using the data sets
stored within the repository.
tDAR's architecture includes three architectural
components, a backend preservation repository based
on the California Digital Library's Micro-Services
model, an interactive web interface, and a research
101

Digital Humanities 2011

platform. Metadata is stored within tDAR using
a extension of the Library of Congress MODS
schema, modified to add archaeologically significant
metadata. This includes descriptive metadata about
the site, location, culture, materials found, among
other attributes. Data sets ingested into tDAR function
differently from data sets in a traditional repository.
Once a data set has been uploaded, users are guided
through the process of documenting their data set
within the system. This process is designed to focus on
identifying non-machine discernible information such
as, whether numeric data represents a measurement
or count and translating coded values or lookup tables
into human-readable values. Once complete, tDAR's
additional features provide unique opportunities to
compare, contrast, and analyze data within the system.
A significant challenge for many disciplines is the
ability to perform synthetic research. Data from
archaeological excavations commonly include a
mixture of standardized observational data such as
Munsell codes to record sediment color and GPS/
GIS readings are combined with more qualitative
assessments about artifact types, or the amount of
"burning" on faunal elements. Within the context of a
specific site, this is easily reconcilable --as the team
develops a common understanding of these terms.
However, utilizing these classifications outside of a
given site, region, or community of archaeologists,
can be challenging. Certain data may lend itself to
the application of universal classification schemes
--including data that is either more scientific or is
derived from a well-documented period. However,
more qualitative data may not be as easily mapped
to a universal classification model --as definitions of
terms will vary between archaeologists or over time.
Instead, contributors may provide, or develop a unique
classification scheme (ontology) to describe their data.
These two approaches represent well-tread road within
both research and practice, with distinct benefits to
each side. However, to perform any useful comparison,
a mapping must be developed.
tDAR does not force users to map data to universal
data models or classification schema. Instead, the
application has developed a different approach -maintain the data in its original, and capturing the
intent of the archaeologist. The application was been
developed with reference ontologies available for
certain data elements including faunal species data
among others. tDAR enables users to create additional
ontologies within the repository, or upload existing one
using the OWL format. Once a column of data is
associated with an ontology, users are presented with
straightforward tools to map the unique data values
102

to terms within the ontology. We believe that this
process serves a number of purposes, not only does
it maintain and represent the data as it was collected,
but it provides opportunities for collaboration and
communication within the discipline as archaeologists
share data, and discuss intents.
Once data has been mapped, the application guides
the user through the data integration process of
selecting data sets, identifying columns to compare,
fine tuning any mapping issues, and producing the new
combined data set. In an analog context, or outside of
tDAR, this process can be time-consuming for one data
set, and overwhelming for multiple. Within tDAR, what
would have been a complex process taking days or
weeks when performed manually becomes much more
fluid, taking hours. With the technology performing
much of the heavy lifting, it leaves the archaeologist
to focus on the specific questions and details of their
research.
While tDAR is still developing, tDAR's data integration
has already enabled Archaeozoologists to ask
novel questions about the cultural and ecological
circumstances under which species are overhunted
or subsistence strategies change. It is our hope
that tDAR's core values of access, preservation,
and integration will enable us to ask, understand,
and evaluate new questions and ideas otherwise
impossible within the field of archaeology.

On the Meaning of the Term 'text'
in Digital Humanities
Caton, Paul

pncaton@gmail.com
Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's
College London

In digital humanities the word "text" (in both mass
and count noun senses)1 occurs ubiquitously; familiar
uses include text encoding, full text search, there
are six texts online, we are using the text of the
first edition. Typically the word is not defined in the
specific context of its use, nor is there an overarching
definition or description so widely accepted that it is
taken as given at all times. However, our various uses
of "text" show we have a priori assumptions about the
nature and scope of its reference. But what are those
assumptions? are they justified? do they collectively
define "(a) text" for us?2

Figure 3 - minimal unit.

In this preliminary investigation I approach from the
outside in. I take a number of marginal cases and of
each one ask "is this a text?" - because any attempt to
answer that question must draw out the assumptions
that underlie our common usages. I focus on the count
noun sense because discrete entities with boundaries
ought to be easier to recognize. In our professional
lives we talk about "texts" all the time: oughtn't we to
know one when we see one?
The marginal cases I discuss are an encrypted
message (Figure 1), a sigil3 created by English
occultist Austin Osman Spare (Figure 2), a minimal unit
(Figure 3), and a poster with quoted words on it (Figure
4).

Figure 1 - encrypted message4

Figure 4 - Second World War poster6

Figure 2 - creation of a sigil from a message string5

103

Digital Humanities 2011

2. Summary of Discussion
I suggest the following are core assumptions
underlying our collective use of "a text":
- representation of language: for any nonmetaphorical use we think that language must be
involved. Unlike a painting or a piece of music,
which seem to affect us unmediated by language,
for something to be "a text" it must resolve to
language in our heads, even if what we see
does not directly represent language. Thus we
see Milton Glaser's famous logo "I [heart symbol]
NY" and in our heads hear the words "I love
New York", because the particular symbol-word
association is so common that it resolves almost
by default - especially given the linguistic context
in which the heart symbol occurs. The encrypted
message in Figure 1 is all linguistic symbols,
but not directly interpretable as any language.
Resolution to language depends upon knowing
how to decipher the symbol sequence - though
I suggest that as creatures of language even if
we do not know the cipher (and so the sequence
remains impenetrable to us) we think it likely that
the sequence we see is a reversible transformation
of a comprehensible linguistic sequence. We accord
it an honorary status as "a text" whose lack of
recognition is due to our ignorance, and not to its
being something other than "a text". But Figure
2 is a different matter. Unlike the product of the
cipher transformation - an incomprehensible string of
what are recognisably linguistic symbols - sigilization
transforms a comprehensible sequence of linguistic
symbols into an almost purely graphic image. I
suggest that seeing the final sigil without knowing its
origin, we would not even accord it honorary status
as "a text", because the deletions, substitutions, and
spatial reconfigurations make it almost impossible
to resolve back into language - there are so few
clues that it started out as language in the first place.
On the other hand, the linguistic message has not
been replaced by a figurative image, in the way that
a photograph of an emaciated child might replace
the symbol sequence "children are starving" - indeed
mimetic representation of the desire conveyed by the
communication would not be to the purpose, "[t]he
idea being," writes Spare, "to obtain a simple form
which can be easily visualised at will, and has not
too much pictorial relation to the desire." (50) For
the person who creates the sigil the message is still
completely present, implying that for them at least
the sigil is "a text".

104

- communication: in the normative case for "a
text" we assume that a linguistic symbol sequence
has been created to communicate, which is the
primary function of such sequences. We assume
the sequence forms a message (or, in the case
of a fragment, would form a message if the entire
sequence were present). We have such a propensity
to find a message, to make sense out of a sequence,
that we will try to establish "a text" even in the least
promising cases. Because the glyph shown in Figure
3 represents a character that (in addition to being a
letter) is also a lexical item in English it triggers that
response, but because the lexical item is supposed
to function as a determiner yet here determines
nothing it gives us no semantic purchase. Compare
this to Figure 3b:

Figure 3b

This is another glyph that represents a character that
is both letter and lexical item, and here in majuscule
form as proper to the lexical item. Because pronouns
carry more semantics than indefinite articles it gives
us more 'traction'; I suggest that we would rank
Figure 3b as closer to being "a text" than Figure 3,
even if we wouldn't commit to saying that it is "a text".
- completeness: the completeness of the message
embedded in the symbol sequence depends entirely
upon the context. What is merely part of "a text" in
one context can stand alone in another context, as
the excerpt from Churchill's speech does in Figure

Digital Humanities 2011

4. If we say that the poster in Figure 4 contains
"a text", though, does that text contain the words
"The Prime Minister" - or are we looking at two
texts, one (just the quote) embedded in another (the
whole linguistic symbol sequence)? When we hold
a paperback book - an edition of Moby Dick, for
example - how many texts are represented in that
physical object?

3. Some Preliminary Conclusions
There is a type of thing called "text" which is a symbol
or sequence of symbols that either directly represents
language or can be resolved back into language by
reversing an earlier, non-arbitrary transformation. In
this mass noun sense, text exists, is independent of
context, and independent of individual interpretation
or experience. However, while text in the mass noun
sense must be what makes up text in a count noun
sense, there is no such thing as "a text" that is
independent of context or of individual experience
and interpretation. No linguistic symbol sequence
is naturally "organic" or "unitary" (the adjectives
used by the TEI Guidelines), though any complex
sequence will have structural features that offer
themselves as convenient boundaries. Nevertheless
these boundaries are always artificial, as much recent
work on genetic editions has shown.7 Being "a text" is
a status we give some text in a particular context and
at our choosing. In this sense "a text" is, as Renear and
Dubin say in a somewhat similar context, "a matter of
contingent social/linguistic circumstances" (2007 p.8)
and is thus - as they similarly concluded about three of
the four FRBR Group 1 entity types - not a type but a
role. In other words I suggest that being "a text" is not
what Guarino and Welty would term a rigid property of
any instance of text in its mass noun sense.8 A good
deal of ontological work needs to be done, however,
before this can be asserted with confidence.

Notes
1. By the end of the paper I hope the relation between the mass and
the count senses of the noun "text" will be clear. That "text" has
a count noun sense is embodied in the Text Encoding Initiative
Guidelines (2008 passim).
2. Text encoding models have of course benefited greatly from
the "ordered hierarchy of content objects" definition proposed in
DeRose et al 1990 and its subsequent refinements such as in
Renear et al 1996. Caton 1999 discusses the relation between
the TEI element <text> and the concept of "a text". Caton and the
INKE Research Group 2010 argues for greater precision in the
use of core digital humanities terms such as "text".
3. Sigils in general are magical symbols, and as used by Austin
Osman Spare "are developed by fusion and stylization of
letters" (Frater, U. D. 1991, 7). The letters come from a sentence
that expresses a particular desire of the magical practitioner.

is essential to all its instances" where by "essential" they follow
Lowe in saying that "an essential property of an object … [is one
where] the object has that property always and in every possible
world" (2001 p.57). An example of a rigid property that they use
several times is PERSON: "if x is an instance of PERSON, it must
be an instance of PERSON in every possible world" (2001 p.57).
They contrast PERSON with STUDENT; STUDENT is a property
an entity can have and then not have without the entity changing:
the same is not true of PERSON.

1. Abstract
Land deeds were the only proof of ownership
in pre-1900 Taiwan. They are indispensable for
the studies of Taiwan’s social, anthropological, and
economic evolution. We have built a full-text digital
library that contains more than 30,000 land deeds. The
deeds in our collection range over 250 years and are
collected from over 100 sources. The unprecedented
volume and diversity of the sources provide an exciting
source of primary documents for historians. But they
also pose an interesting challenge: how to tell if two
land deeds are related.
In this paper we describe an approach to discover
one of the most important relations: successive
transactions involving the same property. Our method
enabled us to construct over 3,300 such transaction
pairs. We also introduce a notion of land transitivity
graph to capture the transitivity embedded in these
transactions. We discovered 2,219 such graphs, the
largest of which includes 103 deeds. Some of these

discovery of a new type of land use that had never been
observed before.

2. Introduction

3. Discovering Land Transaction Relations

Until the turn of the 20th century, hand-written land
deeds were the only proof of transaction of lands
in Taiwan. Such a deed may involve activities such
as selling/buying, lending of land to smaller farmers,
dividing the land among children or shareholders,
and cultivation permits. The deeds usually follow,
depending on their types, a typical but not standard
format, and are drown up in ad hoc manner. Indeed,
even the name of the location may be written in a local
convention unfamiliar to the outsiders.

We start by describing the two relations among land
deeds that our method tries to capture.

While each land deed may have significance only to its
owner, a large collection of them provides a fascinating
glimpse into the pre-modern Taiwanese grassroots
society. Historians have studied them to investigate the
economic activities, community development, and the
relationship among the various ethnic groups (Chen,
1997; Ka, 2001; Shih, 2001; Hong, 2005).
In the past few years we have built a full-text digital
library of primary historical documents of Taiwan
called THDL (Taiwan History Digital Library). Among
its corpuses is a collection of over 30,000 land
deeds, spanning from 1666 to the first decade of the
20th century, and collected from over 100 sources
of origin (Hsiang, Chen, Tu, 2009). This collection
is unprecedented in terms of volume, time span,
geographic distribution, and variety. While THDL
presents an exciting source of primary materials for
historians, it also poses a challenge: how to find
the relationship between two land deeds, or, how to
find all the land deeds involving the same piece of
land. Although it was customary to hand down earlier
deeds to the new owner during the transaction of land,
most of these links were broken when the Japanese,
during their colonial rule of Taiwan between 1895 and
1945, modernized the land management system (Li,
2004). That is because the officials only recorded the
last deed as the proof of ownership but ignored the
previous ones. Consequently many of the older deeds
were either destroyed or (later) sold as collector’s items
because they had lost their original value.

Successive transaction pairs: A piece of land could
be sold from A to B, then from B to C. In this
case there should be two land deeds recording
the two transactions. We call them a successive
transaction pair. Note that the situation could be rather
complicated. For instance it could have been B’s
son who sold it to C. If B divided the land among
his descendents, the first selling transaction and the
ensuing allotment agreement (see below) also form a
successive transaction pair.
Allotment agreements: An allotment agreement is a
deed that records how a land is divided among the
owner’s descendants or among the shareholders. In
both cases the usual practice is to first divide the
land into several parts, then to have each participant
drawing from the lot. Once the decision is agreed
upon, an agreement is written, and several copies
are made and given to each person involved. In the
case of division among shareholders, the allotment
agreements should be preceded by a cultivation
permit, a permission from the government to allow a
group of people to cultivate the land. In this case, the
cultivation permit and the ensuing allotment agreement
also form a successive transaction pair.

In this paper we present a semi-automated method to
discover the transaction relations among land deeds.
We shall focus on two important relations: successive
transaction pairs and allotment agreements. We
further connect the transitive activities on the same
piece of land into a concept called land transitivity
graph, which captures the history of the land over time.
The largest such graph that we found has led to a
107

Digital Humanities 2011

this information (Fig. 3). Second, we defined rules to
identify deeds that may be related. Fig. 4 shows the
rules we used for identifying the successive transaction
pairs. We then wrote a program to compare every pair
of land deeds in THDL to see if any pair satisfied the
rules. Finally, we give all the pairs produced to human
expert to verify.

Fig. 3 The features of a “selling” type of land deed, stored in XML
Fig. 1 The process for discovering land transaction relations

To tackle this problem of finding successive transaction
pairs, we developed a 3-step semi-automatic process
(Fig. 1). We first used text processing technology to
extract features of each land deed from its metadata
and full text. Such features include the transaction
type, the general location of the land and the four
reaches (boundaries identifying the land via some
obscure way such as “bordering Lee’s house on the
south,” “a large camphor tree on the west,” etc), the
names of the people involved in the transaction and
their roles (seller, buyer, scrivener), description of the
source of the land (how and when the current owner
obtained it), the size, the price, and the amount of taxes
paid (Lu, 2008; Huang, 2009). Fig. 2 is an example of a
typical land deed. We designed an XML format to hold
108

We further remark that a criterion that allows certain
degree of fuzziness was used when performing
matching. This is because the names used in different
deeds may sometimes be slightly different even if they
are the same place or person (Huang, 2009).

Digital Humanities 2011

Fig. 4 The rules for identifying successive transaction pairs

The precision rate of the algorithm for successive
transaction pairs is 63.9% and that for allotment
agreements is 94.4%. We have found 2,409
successive transaction pairs and 878 sets of allotment
agreements among the 30,820 land deeds in THDL
(Table 1).

Table 1 The result of reconstructing land transaction
relations among the land deeds in THDL

Among the former, 358 are cross-generation (A sold to
B, and B’s descendent sold to C). Some of the pairs/
sets are from different sources (the “cross sources”
column in Table 1), and are quite impossible to find
manually. Some others are from the same source but
are not adjacent to each other in their original order.
These are also difficult to identify by hand.

4. Land Transitivity Graphs

Table 2 The land transitivity graphs
constructed among the land deeds in THDL

Fig. 5, the third largest graph, contains 36 deeds,
dating from 1850 to 1910. The head of the family,
Liao Jiafu (廖佳福), was among the shareholders
who received a cultivation permit from the Qing
government, and obtained this piece of land through
allotment in 1850 (the first deed).

When further examining the transaction pairs, an
interesting transitive phenomenon emerged. There
may be a deed of A selling a piece of land to B, and
some years later B divided the land among his sons,
then one of them, C, rented it to D to farm. Such
transitive activities on the same piece of land could last
for decades. By connecting all these transactions into
a graph, it may capture the evolution of a property over
time.
This is exactly what we did. We call these graphs land
transitivity graphs. Using the relations we discovered
early, we came up with 2,219 such graphs. The result
is listed in Table 2.

109

Digital Humanities 2011

facility, we also added tag cloud, chronological
distribution, and a location map.

Fig. 7 The integration environment for land transitivity graphs

5. Concluding Remarks

Fig. 5 The 3rd large graph, containing 36 deeds

Liao farmed the land for 50 years and divided it among
his descendents in 1901 (the second deed). The rest
of the deeds described the various activities such as
further divisions or selling in the next 10 years. By
1906, only 2 of the 8 divided pieces of land remained
in the Liao family.

Land deed research has been an important topic
among historians of pre-1900 Taiwan. In this paper,
we presented a method to discover the transaction
relations among the 30,820 land deeds in THDL, the
largest existing full-text database of land deeds. Our
method discovered 2,049 successive transaction pairs
and 878 sets of allotment agreements. They, in turn,
are transformed into 2,219 land transitivity graphs,
each of which describes the transaction evolution of
a piece of land. One such graph has already led to
the discovery of a unique pattern of land development
that had not been studied before (Tu, 2010). We feel
that our work demonstrates how IT tools can be used
to help historians conduct research that could not be
done otherwise.

Names in Novels: an Experiment
in Computational Stylistics
van Dalen-Oskam, Karina

karina.van.dalen@huygensinstituut.knaw.nl
Huygens Institute for the History of the Netherlands KNAW, The Hague

The growing amount of digital texts and tools is slowly
but definitely changing the way literary scholars design
their research. This paper will describe the effects for
one research topic: ‘literary onomastics’, the study of
the usage and functions of names in literary texts.
Research in literary onomastics usually is qualitative
in nature and focuses on 'significant' names in literary
texts. No quantitative or comparative studies have
been published yet. Several researchers, however,
have pointed out that names can only be called
significant if they are studied in the context of all the
names - the so-called 'onymic landscape' - in a text,
oeuvre, genre etc. (e.g. Sobanski 1998). This question
is comparative by nature and implies the wish for a
more quantitative, computer-assisted approach.
As to name usage, first we have to find out what
is normal. We want to know how many name forms
usually occur in a novel, and how many of these are
personal names, place names, and other names. As
to name functions, a useful disctinction is between plot
internal and plot external names. Plot internal names
refer to characters, places or other entitities which
only ´exist´ in the fiction of the story. Plot external
names refer to persons, places or other entities which
are known to exist or to have existed in the real
world. Most place names are plot external, referring
to real countries, cities, streets, etc. and thus have a
reality enhancing function. In fantasy novels, however,
place names are usually fictional and thus plot internal,
enhancing the unreality, the fantasy of the story.
Plot external personal names seem to function as
characterizations of the fictional characters, describing
e.g. their political or cultural preferences.
It is expected that different authors, genres, time
periods or even languages apply these different types
and functions in different ways, showing different
trends which we want to discover in what we like to call
comparative literary onomastics (Van Dalen-Oskam
2005, 2006). The ultimate aim of the research is to
develop a method to compare the name usage and
functions on as large a scale as possible, explicitly also
across languages. So what is needed to do that?
111

Digital Humanities 2011

The amount of names in a text can be expressed in
the percentage of the total amount of tokens in the
text. For that, we need digital texts of fair to good
quality. To tag all the names, we need named entity
recognition and classification (NERC) tools. Different
forms of the same name (e.g. Patrick and Patrick's)
need to be grouped by a lemma (PATRICK in this
case). Different name forms for the same person or
place need to get the same identification (e.g. the
name Alfred and the name Issendorf both belong to the
character identified as ALFRED ISSENDORF). To find
out whether we can compare the resulting percentages
across languages, we focused on a corpus of modern
Dutch and English novels and their translations into the
other language. We found we have to include two other
levels of aggregation: mentions and name tokens.
Mentions are occurrences of a name irrespective
of the number of tokens used. So several name
tokens can be used in one mention. This distinction is
necessary because different languages have different
tokenization rules. The Dutch personal name GerritJan, e.g., with a hyphen and therefore counted as one
token, is translated in English as Gerrit Jan, resulting
in two tokens. Our corpus consists of 22 Dutch and 22
English novels, added with the translation into the other
language of ten in each group.

one is (American-)English (Of the Farm), added with
the English translation of one of the Dutch novels (The
Twin, translation of Boven is het stil).

Comparative research can only be done when many
scholars collaborate. We will have to make sure that
all those scholars encode their texts in the same
way, considering the same tokens as names. This
may sound easy, but it is not. Even name theorists
have different definitions of what a name is (Van
Langendonck 2007). Guidelines had to be set. We
decided to limit the tagging to the 'prototypical' names,
so those names that are considered names by readers
in general. Something is a name if it refers to a unique
person, place, or object. So we excluded currencies,
days of the week, months, etc. For cases leading to
discussion we defined additional rules.

Figure 2 gives more insight in the role of plot internal
versus plot external names in the same set of novels.
The novels are presented in the same order as in Fig.
1. We can see that the four books for children/young
adults are still exeptional in the percentage of plot
internal names. We also find that three of them have a
rather small amount of plot external name tokens.

We found that not many modern novels are digitally
available yet. Furthermore, NERC tools proved to be
not good enough yet and are using partly different
categories than our research needs (Sekine and
Ranchod 2009). This meant much more manual work
than we expected. The tagging and the statistics are
now done by means of several perl scripts written by
André van Dalen and an ingenious Excelsheet with
macros designed by David Hoover. These tools can be
seen as a prototype for the webservices we need for
this type of comparative stylistic research.
In Figure 1, the percentage of name tokens in a set of
novels is shown. The selection of novels in this graph
consist of sixteen novels of which fifteen are Dutch and
112

Fig. 1

The graph gives as a first impression that we can
expect around 2-3 percent of the tokens in a novel to
be names. For this small selection, it is noteworthy that
the four novels with the highest percentages (around
5 percent) are all books for children or young adults.
Furthermore, the English novels do not show up in
extreme positions compared to the other ones.

Fig. 2

The paper will present the case of names in Gerbrand
Bakker’s novel Boven is het stil / The Twin. Dutch
readers have the impression that the novel does not

Digital Humanities 2011

contain many names, while readers of the English
translation have the opposite impression and point
out that especially geographical names abound. The
comparative computational approach shows that both
reader groups are correct and wrong at the same time.
The novel has around 2% of name tokens, which is
at the lower end of what seems to be normal. But in
the amount of different names (lemmas), geographical
names (place names) do have a special role when
we look at the ratio between personal names and
place names (Figure 3). The trend here is that a novel
contains more different personal names than place
names. In only two cases (Boven is het stil and its
translation The Twin, and Fenrir) a novel has more
different place names. This suggests that place names
have an extra stylistic function in these two novels.
It will be shown in which ways place names function
in the Bakker novel and how this analysis enriches
the understanding of the novel and of the stylistic
possibilities of place names for an author.

We could only show a small part of all interesting
observations to be made about the usage of names
in a corpus of modern Dutch and English novels.
But these first results make us anxious for more,
in the expectation that this approach may lead
to an acceptable method for a.o. across language
comparison of stylistic elements.
We conclude that the preliminary results are sufficiently
interesting to go into the stylistic analysis of
name usage and functions in novels more deeply.
Names also seem promising stylistic elements for a
comparison across languages. The currently available
tools which could be expected to be helpful for this type
of research, proved to be insufficient. We therefore
plan to develop a set of interrelated webservices which
will assist the scholar in the recognition, categorization,
further tagging, and statistical analysis of names in
novels.

Courtney, Angela

The Orlando Project is a text-based resource
containing primary texts, archival documents,
biographies, chronologies and bibliographies. Despite
the collection’s extensive size, Brown et al. reveal their
sustainability challenges in an article published as part
of the “Done” cluster:

The
Victorian
Women
Writers
Project
(VWWP, http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collecti
ons/vwwp/) began in 1995 at Indiana University under
the editorial leadership of Perry Willett and was
celebrated early on for exposing lesser-known British
women writers of the 19th century. The VWWP’s
original focus on poetry was meant to complement The
English Poetry Full-Text Database, but soon Willett
acknowledged the variety of genres in which women
of that period were writing – novels, children’s books,
political pamphlets, religious tracts. The collection
expanded to include genres beyond poetry, and
continued active development from 1995 until roughly
2000 at which point the corpus reached approximately
two hundred texts.

Lack of people, time, or funding has consigned
more than one project involuntarily to becoming
a static tribute to its former activity. The reasons
for this include people moving on, intellectually or
institutionally, without taking their projects along with
them, or people using electronic media to disseminate
without particularly desiring to exploit their potential
for continual updating, but even where the will to
continue persists, inadequate funding mechanisms for
sustainability may make it impossible. This is a shame,
since, as we have argued here in the case of Orlando
and many other digital publications not only does there
remain the potential to enrich the contents, but the first
iteration often merely begins to tap the potential of the
project’s data architecture and potential for interface
development (“Published Yet Never Done”).

ancourtn@indiana.edu
Indiana University Libraries

These nearly two hundred texts comprise only a small
fraction of Victorian women’s writing. Encouraged
by renewed interest among Indiana University’s
English faculty and graduate students, the Indiana
University Libraries and the English Department are
exploring ways to reinvigorate the project. The real
challenge lies in the project’s past and present
susceptibility to graceful degradation, which can be
defined as stagnation or “deterioration of a system
in such a manner that it continues to operate, but
provides a reduced level of service rather than failing
completely” (“Graceful degradation”). This has been
a recurring topic in the digital humanities community
as evidenced by a recently published article cluster,
“Done,” in the Digital Humanities Quarterly (Spring
2009, v 3 n 2) and research by Bethany Nowviskie and
Dot Poter on the very topic:
“Decline is a pressing issue for digital scholarship
because of the tendency of our projects to be
open ended. One could argue that digital projects
are, by nature, in a continual state of transition or
decline. What happens when the funding runs out, or

114

Unfortunately and to no surprise, the VWWP, quite
modest compared to its Orlando Project counterpart,
has also suffered from nearly all the challenges
highlighted by Nowviskie, Porter, and Brown.
In an effort to combat this “darker side of project
management,” a framework for continual project
support is being explored that reaches beyond
any one individual or department (Nowviskie and
Porter). At the crux of this framework is digital
humanities-focused curriculum-building for the English
department in partnership with the library, with a
concentration on scholarly encoding and textual
editing, working with English faculty, librarians,
and technologists. The goals are to leverage
domain expertise in the English Department; integrate
the VWWP as a core research and teaching
tool in the English curriculum; develop TEI and
text encoding expertise in faculty and students;
and through coursework, internships, and other
opportunities, encourage English literature students
— graduates and undergraduates—to continually

Digital Humanities 2011

contribute new content to the VWWP. Tools and
workflows, such as robust encoding guidelines, quality
control assessment, etc. will be provided to ensure
proper markup, and the VWWP editorial board will
additionally vet course output before submission to the
project.
Through our newly offered graduate English course
(L501, Digital Humanities Practicum), an eager and
curious group of students learned not only encoding
skills but also began to develop the collaborative
practices pervasive in the digital humanities. As part
of our talk, we plan to explore whether cultivating
“markup skills” are sufficient enough in establishing a
digital humanities curriculum (Rockwell) and whether
“majoring in English” today means the curriculum
should include awareness of the possibilities that arise
for new scholarship when technology is applied to
literary studies (Lanham). Certainly Indiana University
is not breaking new ground or alone in this
endeavor, but the literature is scarce is terms of
understanding successes of graduate level digital
humanities curricula situated in an English or any
other humanities department. As Diane Zorich reports
in her recent review of digital humanities centers, “A
Survey of Digital Humanities Centers in the United
States,” archives such as the Willa Cather and Walt
Whitman Archives are precisely leveraged for teaching
and learning, and this reporting is promising for
the Victorian Women Writers Project as a project
reconceived to meet both teaching and research needs
in a classroom setting (19).
Currently, the VWWP is a standard e-text project,
although current plans call for phased, modular
development that will eventually include now
commonplace “Web 2.0/3.0” functionalities. By
garnering institutional commitment (at the risk of
wavering priorities) across multiple departments
(thereby minimizing risk), we hope to achieve the
following:
- Encourage English department buy-in and continual
collaboration by updating the current state of the
VWWP’s functionality and modernizing the lookand-feel (eliminate “first impressions” syndrome
discussed by Brown et al.)
- Establish a sustainable scholarly encoding
infrastructure based in the English department
curriculum
- Provide a consistent mechanism (e.g., coursework
output) for critical content to accompany the
encoded texts

- Facilitate connections between other DLPsupported Victorian projects like the Swinburne
Project and the Victorian Studies Bibliography
- Evolve the project’s encoding guidelines, inclusion
of critical contextual materials, and advanced
functionality (e.g., visualizations, textual analysis
tools, blog integration, etc.) so that the VWWP
becomes a dependable, growing and relevant online
resource that can be adopted as a pedagogic and
research tool for Victorian scholars
Our talk will introduce the Victorian Women Writers
Project, explore curriculum-building strategies; and
propose ways in which faculty and students can
reliably and perpetually contribute to the VWWP.

Reusability of Literary Corpora:
the "Montaigne at work" Project

1. Introduction
I shall examine to what extent the BVH (Virtual
Humanistic Libraries) project on Montaigne could be
considered not simply another electronic edition, but
also a component of a digital humanities infrastructure,
observing the keywords of an integrated search:
reliability, sustainability, dissemination, and above
all, reusability. Is a project about Montaigne's work
compatible with the "genericity" required for an
undertaking that concerns a wide community?

2. "Montaigne at Work" in the BVH Website
The Bibliothèques Virtuelles Humanistes (http://
www.bvh.univ-tours.fr) offers facsimiles (jpeg and light
pdf) of books or manuscripts, extracted graphics with
their indexing systems, and a textual database called
Epistemon. It offers two types of digital surrogates
of the book: the facsimile and, for some documents
written in French, the corresponding transcription
without modifications.
In itself, the idea of digitizing Montaigne's complete
works is not original. A "Corpus Montaigne" already
exists on CD-Rom but no online version is available at
present, and access is limited to the few libraries that
could afford it.1The "Montaigne project" in Chicago (P.
Desan) offers many documents related to Montaigne:
it displays the "Villey" edition with every page of the
"Bordeaux copy" (Exemplaire de Bordeaux, the socalled "EB"), but the distinction between the three main
layers (1580-1582, 1588, 1588-EB) does not comply to
the requirements of modern philology and scholarship:
cancellations are not visible, and the editor modified
the punctuation as well as the spelling.2The 1595
(posthumous) edition is already available in HTML
format at the mysterious Trismegiste website, but there
is no XML encoding, and the spelling is regularized. 3In
our project, all the editions will offer the double display
of original/regularized spelling; indexes of names,
places, errata, and a basic encoding appropriate for
116

Digital Humanities 2011

early printed books and manuscripts. Easy retrieval
of both versions, in the format preferred (XML/TEI,
HTML, PDF) will be the user's choice, according to the
principle of reusability.
As we share our expertise with cultural institutions,
we borrow our techniques and methods of digitization
of cultural heritage objects, such as rare books
collections, from libraries and archive repositories:
digitization, metadata organization and catalogs, and
database management. Our membership in the
European Library (Europeana) helps to understand the
difference between a cultural heritage attitude and a
research project.4The parallel display of the facsimiles
and their transcriptions, TEI encoding, tools for
scholarly annotations and an accurate query system
are not simple challenges to take on: the uniqueness
of every work of art, the complexity of the process
of writing seems incompatible with the unified view
of textual databases usually found in library websites
(e.g. Shakespeare at the British Library) or linguistic
corpora (Frantext database or ARTFL in Chicago).
Scholarly annotation will be minimal, and limited to the
accuracy of the transcription, in order to provide a basis
for further commentary, encyclopedic information, and
glossaries. The very process of building the corpus for
online publication is a field of new research in this case,
for it combines ergonomic full display and retrieval,
complex and relevant extraction procedures, treatment
of texts and graphics.
The "Montaigne at work" project aims to support
both the reading and the mining of the text, and to
render the chronology. Our new data, expertise, and
tools will try to fulfill the main goal we have always
had of understanding Montaigne's Essays better: 1)
to offer a genetic editionof the "Bordeaux copy,"
containing several layers of handwritten additions
that reveal up to seven moments of writing or rewriting; 2) to give access to what is left of the
famous "Librairie de Montaigne". The main corpus
(all the editions from 1580 to 1595, with their
transcriptions) will be enshrined inside a wider set
of later editions of the Essais (Marie de Gournay's
copy, Rousseau's copy), of several other works of
Montaigne (the translation of the Theologie naturelleby
Raymond Sebond, the Journal de voyage), of all
his surviving manuscripts (marginalia, letters and
Parliament archives), and of facsimiles of about a
hundred identified sources (mainly classics, but also
books by his contemporaries).

3. Genetic Encoding
The genetic edition of the Bordeaux copy, compatible
with the TEI schemas for manuscripts and prints, and
the "TEI Renaissance encoding" protocol developed
in Tours,5raises the question of the relevance
of such an undertaking. It must from with a
benchmarking of other websites offering open access
to digitized works of late Medieval and Early Modern
period (Chaucer, Dante, Shakespeare, Cervantes,
Descartes, Molière,...). What kind of textual properties
do these sites represent? Do they use several models?
Exclusive tools? Many literary projects, particularly in
France, do not use TEI encoding (Flaubert in Rouen,
Montesquieu in Lyons, Stendhal in Grenoble), and
scholarly corpora seem to be specific to each author.
Classicists and Medievalists have opened many doors,
and they know quite well how to refine an ultradiplomatic encoding and display. Rendering the writing
process requires the adequate edition to feed every
hypothesis about the moments of the gesture itself, the
"traits de plume" (pen strokes), and the modifications
the printing press of the time forced upon the original.
Special software designed by our computer science
partners (in Tours, Paris, Rouen, La Rochelle) is
currently being developed to detect image similarity.
Thus, Montaigne's different "hands" could be classified
according to time and language, with the expert help
of Alain Legros (researcher in Tours, and an expert in
Montaigne's handwriting).6We need also the clearest
visualization of the readable parts, the possibility of
displaying either a smoothed text or a page, which
represents all the complex arrangements of the words
in a spatio-temporal order. No models seem to be
directly reusable: ours would take place between
the very precise reconstitution of all the spellings of
Medieval texts (e.g. the Actes des Apôtresproject) and
the Madame Bovarydigital edition of manuscripts at the
University of Rouen, but with a display system that
would look like the Deutsche Text Archive (DTA): the
facsimile of the page linked to the HTML text, and to
the XML/TEI source, searchable with PhiloLogic (Mark
Olsen, University of Chicago) and other NLP tools,
with the XTF search engine.7All the quotations of the
Bordeaux copy will be fully referenced and translated
in French.
In Tours, we have already begun the keyboarding
and encoding of the main editions (1580-82, 1588,
1595). The genetic edition of the Bordeaux copy will
be based on the principles of the ITEM laboratory
(École Normale Supérieure, Paris), a leader in genetic
analysis, which are compatible with the TEI tagging
of the main operations (addition, deletion, inversion,
117

Digital Humanities 2011

etc.), according to the latest documentation of the TEI
consortium. The COST "Interedition" project (funded
by Europe) offers several tools to test (e.g. Collatex
for the main editions), and discusses some issues
close to our preoccupations, such as the limits of
crowdsourcing: we plan to use collaborative annotation
by scholars for corrections of errors. 8
Every layer of text must be retrievable, to avoid
incompatibility between the genetic and the generic,
and to guarantee reusability to anyone who
wishes to process the text (with permission) for
other purposes. Ideally, a collaborative edition of
Montaigne's Essaiswould blossom out of the accurate
transcription of the Bordeaux copy, and/or of the
posthumous 1595 edition: the debate is still pending
among specialists.

4. Automatic Regularization
We will generate three levels of transcripts:
1. the "quasi-diplomatic" transcript, crucial for the
comparison between the typeset and the
handwritten passages (the spelling of which has
never been thoroughly studied)

if one looks for « étude » (in modern French), the old
spelling will not be offered, and one will miss the variant
« estude » in the corpus, where moreover the word is
typed without hyphenation.9

5. Montaigne's Library
Thus, Montaigne's library itself can be rebuilt through
the comprehensive digitization of what remains of
the hundred known copies with his signatures and
annotations: 33 are preserved at the French National
Library, 30 at the Bordeaux Public Library, others in at
least 15 other libraries and private collections. Samples
of his handwriting will be analyzed and compared
to non-attributed manuscripts, in order to confirm or
exclude dubious documents.
Such a project will enlarge the knowledge we already
have of Montaigne's method of writing, within the
context of his favorite readings. If other projects
provide data, this one offers also reusable sets of
transcriptions, facsimiles and new tools for further
analysis.
Notes

2. the "cultural heritage" transcription that regularizes
the distinction of I/J and U/V, expands the
brevigraphs and normalizes the ends-of-lines, so
that the corpus can be processed by the NLP tools
and parallel corpora analysis

engines can offer accurate results to anybody.

A prototype of I/J U/V normalization tool is already

dictionaries.

The development of these tools benefits one of the two
Google awards that the University of Tours obtained in
December 2010 for "Full-text retrieval and indexation

With these spellings, the user who is not a specialist will
find only few results in his word or string query because
of typographic abbreviations ( façōfor façon), obsolete
morphology ( veusfor veux), and the frequent lack of
hyphenation. In modern editions, one will find easily «

Joanna Baillie’s Witchcraft: from
Hypermedia Edition to Resonant

This paper will report on the first eighteen months
of a 3-year grant funded by the Fonds québecois
de la recherche sur la société et la culture led by
playwright Patrick Leroux (overseeing the creative
component) and Michael Eberle-Sinatra (overseeing
the academic component). The specific nature of this
group project is nestled in the promising dialogue to
be established between Romantic literature scholars,
a theatre practitioner, and a scholar preoccupied with
the pedagogy of Romantic drama using hypermedia as
a template and an engaging interface.
When artists teach, they never quite relinquish their
initial creative impulse. Historical works, while being
taught for their intrinsic value and larger pertinence
within a literary context, nevertheless solicit a resonant
response. Classroom exercises in both academic and
creative courses suggest that many students engage
in a similar empathic manner when allowed to prod,
question, and interact actively with a studied text.
The “creative” component of this research-creation
project with strong pedagogical intent is precisely
linked to an artistic response to the source text,
Joanna Baillie’s Witchcraft. In addition to the edited
text, its scholarly annotations and commentary, and
the filmed Finborough production of the play, we will
create workshop situations with actors and students in
which the play will be explored in rehearsal prompting
us to investigate other manners of staging the work
and illustrating, through filmed documentation, the
process of reading a text for performance. Short
video presentations of key creative and interpretive
issues will be edited for inclusion in the hypermedia
presentation. The actual process, whether filmed or
not, will allow the actors and creative faculty to fully

immerse themselves in Baillie’s world and work in
order to fuel their resonant responses to them.
This second creative component, the resonant
response, will take the form of short theatrical
pieces conceived for film. The nuance is essential
as the pieces will not be short cinematic films but
rather short-filmed theatrical pieces. The emphasis on
speech, dramatic action, and relationship to a defined
theatrical space will differentiate these pieces from
more intimate, image-based cinematic pieces. The
resonant responses could be as short as two minutes
or as long as ten minutes, in order to fully explore
very precise formal issues (a character’s speech, the
subtext in a given dialogue, what we couldn’t stage
during the 19th Century but feel we could now).
These creative pieces will be developed with Theatre,
Creative Writing, and English literature students and
faculty.
Existing TEI guidelines for scholarly encoding do
not account for the unique relationship between a
play script and performance practice and history.
Scholarly encoding typically views the structures of
texts in relation to the protocols that guide how
readers interpret documents. But dramatic scripts
require different kinds of reading and, thus, different
kinds of encoding. Performance-informed inquiry into
play texts depends on a reader’s ability to think about
the range of possibilities—both historically distant
and contemporary—for theatricalization of a line of
dialogue, a bit of physical action, or a visual space.
Additional historical materials on the theatre and
culture of Baillie’s era will be provided by team
members. For our hypermedia resource to organize
multi-media materials in ways that will help students in
literature classes to use the hypermedia edition of the
play, we will need to develop innovative customizations
of TEI encoding guidelines. Discovering how best to
support a student reader’s work with a historically
unfamiliar dramatic work provides an important test
case for existing guidelines for XML encoding of
drama.
This project will take an innovative approach in
several senses. It will use hypermedia to try to
solve a classroom problem created by plays with
little performance history or connection to familiar
theatrical styles. It will also test the limitations of
the TEI scholarly encoding guidelines by exploring
how, in the case of play scripts, building hypermedia
resources requires creative, user-oriented strategies of
encoding. The research-creation program will illustrate
how contemporary artists can engage with historical
works, while shedding light onto the theatrical creative
119

Digital Humanities 2011

process. Finally, our Resonant Response to Joanna
Baillie’s Drama will combine scholarly research on
Romantic drama, practice-driven analysis, the creation
of new work, and hypermedia expertise.
This particular research-creation program is singular
and innovative in its combination of academic close
reading, dramaturgical analysis, dramatic writing and
theatrical performance, filmed theatre, and a resolutely
pedagogical preoccupation with a full and thorough
exploration of the possibilities of hypermedia edition.
In addition to creating a prototype hypermedia edition,
the project seeks to find out:
- what value performance annotations can add to a
teacher’s work with students on a seldom-performed
play;
- how the Text Encoding Initiative’s (TEI) scholarly
encoding guidelines can best be customized to
design hypermedia play editions;
- how the process of collaboration among faculty
and students in humanities and communications
disciplines can enrich understanding of technology’s
interaction with interpretation.

1. Scattered Landscapes
The world of humanities has seen an enormous
growth in available digital text resources in the
last decade. This development was driven by many
factors like advancements in relevant technologies
like OCR, increasing competence in the field of
digital encoding and publication, and the spreading of
widely accepted encoding formats. It is by now widely
understood (among both researchers and funders)
that publications and created resources have to be
standardized to ensure their relevance for future work
and their (re-)use in a linked data environment.
More and more projects with partially very specific
research questions are working on the encoding of
their results in various (mostly XML based) formats.
Encoding standards and formats were established
that are widely used and supported by various tools
and a helping community. In the field of encoding
textual resources the standards of the Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI) and their various dialects are well
represented. To cover a wide range of data it is
common to create a specific dialect that fits the own
data best without losing all compatibility with other
projects. As a consequence, various encoding variants
exist that cope with similar data but create different
schemata to represent them. A drawback of this
specialism are problems with aggregating existing data
stocks to one global resource: Even combining solely
meta data of editions of the same work becomes an
expensive (since labor intensive) task. Creating true

120

Digital Humanities 2011

hypertextuality in digital libraries (Berti et al., 2009)
that will massively connect resources in a distributed
infrastructure will intensify this problem. Hence data
integration will gain relevance in the field of distributed
resources.
Since data storage solutions like relational database
management systems are often used (for example
when fast access to or complicated requests on the
data is necessary) this issue does not only apply on
the XML data model. These systems often use ETLprocedures (Extract, Transform, Load) to gain uniform
and comparable data. The key problem remains the
same: A lot of time is spent to gain a clean stock of
data and consistent meta data. Experiences show that
especially at projects using quantitative approaches,
with a demand for large (and as homogeneous as
possible) data sets, up to one third of all human
resources are needed to overcome different kinds of
heterogeneity.
This paper concentrates on the question how existing
schema matching techniques that are established in
data warehousing and information integration can be
used to identify identical structures of different editions
of the same source material. Therefore a high similarity
of the content can be assumed, whereas structural
and semantic heterogeneity prevents fast integration.
As all modern storage solutions rely on schema
definitions, it was not the task to identify corresponding
element instances of two documents but to identify
correspondences between collections of documents.
For this reason in the following the term 'element' will
be used for the set of all elements having the same
position in one schema (for example all TEI/teiHeader/
fileDesc/titleStmt/titleelements in a set of XML files or
all values for one column work-namein a relational
database table).
This approach has two advantages: generic profiles for
every schema element can be created (thus minimizing
the effects of outliers) and computational time is
reduced by minimizing the number of comparisons that
have to be made to find useful schema mappings.
To illustrate the procedure different versions of the
Duke Databank of Documentary Papyri (DDbDP) were
used. These include the Perseus version of the
DDbDP, its EpiDoc encoded equivalent (Epiduke) and
an extraction from the latter, stored in a flat relational
schema. These data are only to be seen as a first
testing environment. Further evaluation on other text
types is in progress.

2. General Approach
The whole process of finding corresponding elements
or larger element structures can be separated into
three major working steps:
1. Fingerprinting: By using various features a
fingerprint is created for every element, taking
different element properties into account.
2. Linking: Elements of both schemata are chosen
pairwise that are likely matching candidates.
3. Scoring: Every linked pair is scored by a similarity
measure.
To identify corresponding elements of two schemata,
for every addressable element various features are
used. These features address different types of
similarity like structural similarity (with the focus on
schema information) or semantic similarity (with the
focus on elements' content). Most of the used features
do not depend on specific structures or access
methods, hence every addressable element can be
used and compared. As a consequence XML or
SGML documents, columns in a relational database
or every other (semi-)structured input schema can
be used. Existing works have shown that using only
a single feature is not sufficient to identify similarity
(Algergawy et al., 2009). For this reason all measures
are combined and normalized by a weighted sum.
As there is a wide range of syntactic and semantic
ambiguities it is unlikely to achieve a full automated
matching. Hence it is the goal to establish an
integration procedure that allows a more efficient
handling of new data resources to minimize the effort of
integrating these resources into an existing data stock.

3. Methodology

3.1. Used Features
A wide range of different features are known in
the field of data integration. Some of these make
use of structural schema information (schema based)
while others use the elements' content (instance
based). A constraint based approach checks the type
and limitations of data, e.g. the domain of numbers
or the differences in cardinality or uniqueness of
elements. These features work on different levels:
some concentrate on the combination of elements,
their hierarchy or their number of child nodes (structure
level), while others focus on individual elements and
their attributes (element level).

121

Digital Humanities 2011

The following features were tested on their usefulness
for the described problem. Table 1 gives a short
overview of used approaches and their classification
(based on Rahm et al., 2009).

collection of XML files or all data in a column of a
relational schema.

- Name similarityuses the Levenshtein distance to
compute string similarity of database column names,
respectively XML element names. For example an
element name authorshas a distance of 1 from an
element named author, but a distance of 5 from the
string work.

Name

x

Path

x

- Path similaritycompares the structural depth of
elements, under the assumption that similar
elements have similar positions (and therefore
similar distances to the root element) in their
respective schema.
- Cosine similarityuses the Vector Space Model by
representing the content (i.e. the occurring terms)
of every element as a vector in a high dimensional
vector space. To reflect different importance of terms
(for example stop words versus domain-specific
keywords) all terms are weighted by using the
tf.idfmeasure (Salton et al., 1988). The result vectors
are compared using the cosine similarity: $sim_{cos}
(p_1, p_2) = \frac{v_{p1} \cdot v_{p2}}{|v_{p1}| \cdot
|v_{p2}|}$.
- Dice coefficientcalculates the ratio of words, that
appear in both compared elements to all occurring
words: $sim_{dice}(p_1,p_2) = \frac{2 |W_{p1} \cap
W_{p2}|}{|W_{p1}| + |W_{p2}|}$. For example an
element that contains the words {bank, money,
account, credit} is similar to an element containing
the words {bank, money, account, financial} (Dice
coefficient = 0.75), but less similar to an element
containing the words {bank, river, water} (Dice
coefficient ~ 0.29)
- Frequency similarityuses the assumption that similar
content is encoded by a similar number of elements.
Therefore this measure produces a high value if the
number of occurrences of the compared elements
are similar.
- Content typecompares the ratio of numbers to
letters. Hence an element with mostly numbers
becomes dissimilar to an element containing mostly
textual data.
All results were normalized to the interval [0,1] (where
necessary), `0' corresponding to no similarity and `1'
to identity.
Features that address the element's content use all
available data: For example the union of all text
addressable with the same XPath expression in a

Overview of used measures and their classification

3.2. Linking
Experiments have shown that many elements in the
chosen XML collections occur very rarely. Therefore
only elements were considered that occur in at least
50 percent of all documents of the respective collection
to reduce the computation time. All other elements of
both compared data sets were linked with each other.
In general a more sophisticated approach would be
useful to minimize the number of comparisons. This
holds especially true in a distributed environment
where network response and transmission time is a
limiting factor. This was not considered in this work
as the focus was on identifying useful features and all
resources were locally available.

3.3. Scoring and Results
The values of all similarity measures are combined by
a weighted sum, yielding a similarity value between
`0' (no similarity) and `1' (identity). Starting by identical
weights for all measures the weights were iteratively
adjusted to enhance the matching precision.
The results show that especially the instance-based
approaches (Dice and Cosine) were successful
for identifying matching elements. These measures
worked well on both XML-XML and relational
database-XML comparisons. All other measures
turned out to be strongly dependent on the compared
formats.
Especially structural differences between optimized
(and redundancy-free) relational schemata and XML
documents prevent good results when relying solely on
schema information: in these cases matching precision
drops significantly. Only instance-based measures
(Dice, Cosine, and content type similarity) achieved
good results, whereas all other measures could be
ignored (hence weighted with 0).

Digital Humanities 2011

A more balanced result shows in the XML-XML
analysis: as both document collections are based
on subsets of TEI formats many relevant elements
are similar regarding their name and position in
the XML structure tree. Therefore especially name
similarity turned out to be a useful indicator for
matching elements. Nonetheless again instance based
measures performed best on these comparisons.

3.4. Visualization
A graphical user interface was created to visualize
the pairwise similarity of elements. In a matrix (c.f.
Figure 1) every row stands for an element of the
document collection 1 and every column for an element
of document collection 2 (or database columns in
case of a relational schema). Each cell contains the
weighted sum of similarity values for the two respective
elements. High certainty values are emphasized with
a strong green color. A tooltip on each cell gives
additional information about the comparison results
(used features and similarity values).
Figure 1 shows an excerpt of a result matrix where
a relational database is compared to a collection
of XML files. Every column represents a database
column of the extracted version of the Epiduke, every
row represents a path in Perseus' DDbDP XML
files. As an example the element placeNamefrom
the collection of XML files has a strong similarity to
the geographycolumn in the database, even though
different element names were used. By analyzing
their content it becomes obvious that there is a
strong extensional overlap between these elements'
content. On the other hand there are no similar XML
elements for the database column female(information
about the author's gender) and work_id(a databasespecific identifier for every work). This is due to
the fact that both elements were created during the
extraction process (or the following post-processing)
and therefore have no corresponding elements in the
original material.

4. Conclusions and Further Work
Various comparisons have shown that especially
semantic approaches are promising for identifying
similar elements. Apparently these measures' results
will degrade when data is compared with a very
small semantic overlap (like editions of different
domains or languages). As a consequence structural
information could be taken into account. For the
analyzed data these measures proved useful where
complex structures exist, but failed on flat relational
schemata.
The existing system is only to be seen as a prototype
that will be extended in the future. The further focus
will be set on adding new features and analysis of
an extended set of input. It is expected that more
efficient and domain-specific profiles can be created
that will be basis for useful weights and combinations
of features. Additionally it is expected that the results
can be improved by using a more in-deep view on
the data (like identification of key words) or further
exploitation of structural information (by including
schema definitions into the classification process).

In the house of non-traditional authorship attribution
are many mansions, or methods, based on statistical
analysis of authorial style. They all compare text
samples of disputed or unknown authorship to texts
written by known authors, or “candidates”. The degree
of similarity or dissimilarity between samples allows
informed guesses on the possible authorship of a
given text. The so-called machine-learning methods
are supposed to be among the most effective; they
include Support Vector Machines, Nearest Shrunken
Centroid classification, Burrows’ Delta and so on (for
a comparison of their effectiveness cf. Jockers and
Witten 2010).
The general feature of the methods in question is a twostep supervised analysis. In the first step, the traceable
differences between samples constitute a set of rules,
or a classifier, for discriminating authorial “uniqueness”
in style. The second step is of predictive nature –
using the trained classifier, one can assign other text
samples to the authorial classes established by the
classifier; any disputed or anonymous sample will be
assigned to one of the classes as well.
The procedure described above relies on a preprocessed corpus of samples. Namely, the clue is to
divide all the available text samples into two groups:
primary (training) set and secondary (test) set. The first
set, being a collection of texts written by known authors
(“candidates”), serves as a sub-corpus for finding the
best classifier, while the second set is a pool of texts
of known authors, anonymous samples, disputed ones
and so on. The better the classifier, the more samples
from the test set are attributed correctly and the more
reliable the attribution of the disputed samples.
Such procedures have been successful in social and
medical studies; no wonder, then, that it soon made
124

Digital Humanities 2011

its way into authorship attribution. Yet, contrary to
the former applications where the researcher usually
enjoys a high number of test samples (e.g. patients),
authorship attribution has to struggle with a limited
number of samples available to train a convincing
classifier. This makes the classifier sensitive to
statistical error. What is more, the generally-accepted
division of data studied into a training set and a test set
further limits the texts that can be attributed.
This sensitivity of machine-learning classifiers to the
choice of samples in the training set has already
been observed (Jockers and Witten 2010: 220).
Intuition suggests composing the training set from
the most typical texts (whatever “typical” means) by
the authors studied (thus, for Goethe, Werther rather
than Farbenlehre). In practice, this can be quite
complicated: in a small corpus, to change a single
training set sample for another can upset the delicate
mesh of interrelationships between all other texts.
This potentially heavy impact on the effectiveness of
attribution tests has not been lost on Hoover: “As
a reminder of how much depends upon the initial
choice of primary and secondary texts, consider what
happens if the same 59 texts are analyzed again, but
with different choices for primary and secondary texts
[...]. If the analyses that are the most successful with
the initial set are repeated, Delta successfully attributes
only 16 of the 25 texts by members of the primary
set” (Hoover 2004a: 461).
Last but not least, any manual selection of texts to both
sets must be highly arbitrary. To further quote Hoover:
“The primary novels for this test are intentionally
chosen so as to produce poor results, but one might
often be faced with an analysis in which there is no
known basis upon which to choose the primary and
secondary texts, and nothing prevents an unfortunate
set of texts like this from occurring by chance” (Hoover
2004a: 461-62).
Machine-learning methods routinely try to estimate the
potential error due to incorrect choice of the training set
samples. This cross-validation consist in a few random
changes to the composition of both sets, followed by
a comparison of the classifier’s success, ten-folded
cross-validation being the standard solution (Tibshirani
et al. 2003: 107; Baayen 2008: 162; Jockers and Witten
2009: 219). The question arises whether ten trials are
sufficient for a classifier which, based on but a few
samples, can be unstable.
Assuming that the training set contains 10
by 10 authors, and the test set another 10
by these authors, there are 210 = 1024
combinations of members of the training

a corpus of 60 novels by 20 authors, this number
becomes so large that testing all possible permutations
of both sets is unrealistic. Instead, the impact of the
composition of the training set on attribution success
can be assessed basing on several hundred random
permutations; this can be done with a variety of
bootstrap procedures (Good 2006).
To test this problem, we have selected several corpora
of similar size and similar number of authors studied
(with the obvious caveat that any comparison between
different languages can never be fully objective).
For each of these corpora, we have performed 500
controlled attribution experiments, each with a random
selection of the training and the test sets. We have
compared the number of correct authors guessed, with
the hypothesis that the more resistant a corpus is to
changes in the choice of the two sets, the more stable
the results.
All tests featured the simplest, the most intuitive
and the most frequently used of machine-learning
attribution methods: Burrows’s Delta (Burrows 2002;
Hoover 2004b). Delta was run for 100 MFWs, then
for 200 and then, at increments of 100, all the way
to 2000 MFWs. This was performed at five different
culling settings (0-100% incrementing by 20), giving
a total of 1000 results, and a mean of these was
recorded. The above procedure was then repeated for
500 random permutations of the texts in the training
set. The density function was estimated for the final
results thus obtained.
It can be assumed that the distribution of these 500
final results should be Gaussian rather than anything
else. The peak of the curve would indicate the real
effectiveness of the method, while its tails – the impact
of random factors. A thin and tall peak would thus imply
stable results, i.e. those resistant to changes in the
primary set.
The analysis of the results begins with the corpus of 63
English novels by 17 authors. As expected, the density
of the 500 bootstrap results follows a (skewed) bell
curve (Figure 1). At the same time, its gentler left slope
suggests that, depending on the choice of the training
set, the percentage of correct attributions can vary,
with bad luck, to below 90%.

It is quite natural that the stability of the results might
also depend on the number of authors and/or texts
analyzed. The same Figure shows that, with fewer
authors, a higher number of texts has no significant
impact on the stability of the results at any permutation
of both sets (the dashed line), as already observed
by Hoover and Hess (2009: 474). With more authors
(i.e. when guessing becomes more difficult), the curve
widens and a perfect match is even less frequent.
And this is still good accuracy and a fairly predictable
model. However, it has to be remembered that Delta
has been shown to be somewhat less perfect in other
languages (Rybicki and Eder 2011).

39 Polish novels by 8 authors (Figure 5, grey solid line).
Therefore, the ideal authorship attribution situation is
not only that of many texts by many authors; it is
equally important to assess the validity of the training
set with a very high number of trials. This seems to
be the only way to escape the quandary of arbitrarily
naming each author’s “typical” text.

Knowledge and Reasoning:
Connecting Scientific Data and
Cultural Heritage

Uncovering and detecting patterns of information
in library and museum collection items requires
the integration of scholarly and scientific data
analyses. Research into the materials substrate
(paper, parchment, etc) and media (ink, pigment,
colorant) that comprise the historic object inform
the scholar as to the provenance of a particular
document. This may be through characterization and
identification of the media and substrate on which the
information is contained, or watermark identification
that can effectively date the document to a specific time
period. The challenge of linking disparate materials
characterization and identification databases and
scientific analyses is a critical research issue requiring
the development of a knowledge representation (KR)
to facilitate interpretation that enables this humanities
research. With cultural heritage objects, the KR must
maintain linkage between the original document that
contains a wealth of knowledge stored contextually,
and digital surrogates that represent the document.
These links will be explored in reference to cultural
treasures of South America, where the integration of
scientific analyses and historic scholarly information
led to the generation of knowledge that enriched
the contextual interpretation of the original object.
Scientific analyses of textile treasures from Llullaillaco
provided an understanding of their use and purpose,
while environmental information of Pre-classic Mayan
structures in the Mirador Basin allowed an assessment
of preservation requirements. Investigations of maps
with specific links to South America yielded information
on the source of pigments and geographical location
of their original creation.
Historic documents and cultural heritage objects do
not generally lend themselves to ease of context
analysis, since documentation about the creation of the
document is not readily available. Discovery of data
with more detail about the context and circumstances
128

that surround the creation of the artifact allows
researchers to visualize information previously not
detected. This visualization is achieved in Library of
Congress studies through advanced spectral imaging
techniques that incorporates data from both visible
and non-visible regions of the spectrum to create
an integrated “digital cultural object” (DCO). The
additional contextual information is not apparent in
conventional digitization techniques for these objects,
so the integration of the spectral data assists in mining
the layers of data stored within the objects. In this way
the DCO provides a range of information that allows
a shift from the use of interpretive virtual heritage
applications that focus on the artistic rather than the
investigative and inferential, towards the development
of interdisciplinary scientific data analyses as part
of cultural heritage humanities scholarly studies. In
this way, cultural heritage, science and technology
are intertwined, advancing the capacity to mine
and analyze historic data from multiple viewpoints.
Interaction and interpretation of these additional
dimensions allow the description of new relationships
between constituent elements, connecting patterns
and mining the data for trends, and correlating
formerly disparate components. For example, the new
identification of pigments in an object that come from
a different geographical location, can then suggests
trade routes and exchange of materials and artistic
techniques. The UNESCO Charter on the Preservation
of Digital Heritage has recognized the importance of
digital versions of cultural materials, referring to digital
heritage as “resources of information and creative
expression” being “increasingly produced, distributed,
accessed and maintained in digital form.”
The composite of images of the maps and textiles
that forms the new DCO is related to, but distinct
from the originals. This digital object is not a
surrogate for the original, but provides new knowledge
through the integration of scientific analysis of these
cultural heritage objects within libraries, museums and
archives. The range of data this new digital object
contains enhances interaction between a range of
professions, allowing multidisciplinary collaboration for
integration of preservation, sociological and cultural
information. Digitally generated and accessed data for
these maps and textiles balances the opposing goals
of libraries and museums and optimizes preservation
of the original objects, while increasing access to
information from the original. Hyperspectral imaging
allows the DCO to create a new interpretation
of the original object, as apparent from the 3dimensional reconstruction of the original woodcut
of the Waldseemüller 1507 world. Since these
original manufacturing materials no longer exist,

Digital Humanities 2011

the DCO allows the representation of this new
scientific knowledge to link with geography and map
curatorial knowledge of the era, and assist a greater
understanding of the printing techniques and possible
location of where these materials originated. This was
the first time America was referred to as America,
on any map, printed or manuscript, with a unique
perspective of South America.

Figure 1. LHS: Section of Printed Sheet of
South America, RHS: 3D Rendering of Woodcut

Image capture and processing of these and other
objects is important for the interpretation of cultural
heritage by allowing layers of data to be analyzed
and linked. This offers an archeological examination of
the information strata, the materials, inter-connections
between the materials used, discovered text and
information, and the relative associations between the
components of the artifact. The creation of an image
data-cube deconstructs layers of data into discrete
components, while conversely also integrating and
utilizing the application of scientific methods to the
recognition of areas of interest within the artifact.
The explanations generated from these processes
expand the associations and extracted knowledge of
the original cultural heritage objects.
There is dynamic interaction between re-examination
of the original or source materials and the DCO,
with raw and processed data that can enhance
obscured and specific features. Inter-connections
and relationships between the source and the
generated interpretations based upon analysis of
generated data are an iterative process. The process
of interpretation relies upon the use of implicit
assumptions, inferences or internal filtering. For both
scientific and scholarly researchers, these processes
are often based upon prior knowledge and experience.
Additional filtering for scientific analyses are introduced
by reference databases that match known reference
materials with “pixel” samples taken from the spectral
images to non-invasively characterize materials.
These categorizations are objective in nature and

reduce the potential error sometimes introduced
by subjective assumptions. However, the essential
element that should not be overlooked in this iterative
process is the power of strong collaborations between
a range of disciplines. In 1999 on Llullaillaco's
summit, an Argentine-Peruvian expedition co-directed
by Johan Reinhard and Argentine archaeologist
Constanza Ceruti found the perfectly preserved bodies
of three Inca children, sacrificed approximately 500
years earlier. These were accompanied by a range
of textiles, figurines and other ceremonial sacrificial
materials. A close collaboration between the American
Museum of Natural History, preservation scientists,
engineers from Argentina and the USA, conservators
and curators was critical to ensuring the preservation
of these unique materials. The interweaving of the
assessment of current condition of the cultural artifacts
such as strength and chemical degradation to aid
their preservation, with scholarly analysis of the unique
patterns of construction enabled the knowledge of both
to be linked so as to create a rare collaboration of the
forensic type recovery of the history of these materials.
This is the highest Inca burial so far discovered
and the world's highest archaeological sit. There was
intense pressure for exhibition of the materials so
close collaboration between all parties to gain as
much scientific and cultural information about the
origins of the materials and the mummies was a
unique component in ensuring their longevity while
on exhibit. This sharing of data aided the control of
exhibit conditions in South America and long-term
management of the materials to allow further studies.
The critical component in the generation of knowledge
in these studies is recognizing the importance of skilled
people and work processes that efficiently add value
and meaning. In order to analyze the original source
material, high resolution spectral imaging creates
the DCO, and data processing and further scientific
analyses revolve around the interactions of the people
involved – preservation scientist, curator, scholar and
technology specialist. This iterative process is reliant
not only upon the effective use of technology to
assimilate process and disseminate the information
with standardized processing, metadata and data
management, but also the quality of the collaborative
interaction between professionals from different fields.
While the relationship between the original and the
DCO is provided through metadata that maintains the
spatial links between the scientific data, the original
material, and the new knowledge generated from
these linkages, the integration of diverse opinions
and perspectives is an integral component of this
new knowledge generation. Standardization of file
129

Digital Humanities 2011

formats and structures across these different fields
provides a method of ensuring continued access
and integration to the information, by maintaining
and creating effective associations while generating
new knowledge. The above examples illustrate the
requirement for this standardization of both scientific
and scholarly files, to enable true international
collaboration and sharing of resources between
countries and disciplines. These protocols can support
effective data exchange with conventions that provide
a local structure for a scientific data network. This
sustains diversity in scientific research and scholarly
studies. This requirement for a structural framework for
cultural heritage institutions allows both user access
and functional usability of information to support
research.
Effective visualization of these data connections is
essential for further associations, with access to both
spatial and temporal data for the maps, textiles and
other objects directly linked back to the original source
material through the DCO. Visualization tools and
interfaces offer potential for open dialogue between
multidisciplinary fields and ease of navigation through
layers of data, since knowledge generation is reliant
on the cohesive interaction and collaboration between
science and humanities researchers. The knowledge
representation and underlying interpretation system
needs to be appropriate for the application and the
types of analyses that are needed for integrating
and expanding cultural heritage research. The
development of XML-based knowledge representation
languages and standards include the Resource
Description Framework (RDF). A major benefit of
RDF is the ability to utilize the features that facilitate
the merging of data, even if the underlying schemas
differ. The further advantage for this heritage science
application is the capacity to support the evolution
of schemas over time, allowing both structured and
semi-structured data to be combined and shared
across different areas within the application. The large
volumes of digital data generated require a repository
that can cope with a diverse range of object types, as
is true for with collections of data used for scientific
analyses. Data files from these objects include images,
spectra, reports, and other extant files, requiring
additional metadata mechanisms to accommodate a
range of data, while retaining access and associations.
An RDF model offers greater flexibility and opportunity
for integration across various disciplines, since it is
designed to accommodate multiple ontologies with a
structured approach. The model or ontology being
exploited within this structure allows us to coordinate
a wide range of data and file types with extensive
metadata and multiple data formats. For example,
130

metadata from the scientific instrument is included
so the measurement could be reproduced, and in
addition the data can be imported in multiple formats
– as spectra for visual representation and as a .csv
standardized sharable data file.

Figure 2. Visual Representation of Layers of Digital Object Data

Scriptospatial mapping of the textiles and maps
involves an accurate coordinate system that links
scientific and scholarly analyses to the DCO, and
allows inferences to be drawn to generate new
knowledge. This approach to viewing the DCO in
relation to multiple dimensions applies an essentially
archeological methodology toward uncovering and
interconnecting information strata of cultural heritage
artifacts. Utilizing an object-oriented approach in
conjunction with the data layer allows the mapping of
spatial and temporal data with increasing complexity.
Examining and explaining the physical, spectral and
chemical properties of the maps and textiles permit the
humanities scholar to link these scientific analyses to
the social aspects of how they were created. These
links therefore create meaningful scientific outcomes
of the content: When obscured or faded text can
be retrieved; inks and pigments characterized and
traced to specific geographical locations; analysis of
the intensity of handwriting imparts understanding of
the author’s original intent; and the provenance and
source of paper is gleaned through the capture and
analysis of the watermark in the paper.
A continued focus on collaboration between people,
data and processes is a major factor in promoting
access and integration of scientific and humanities
research, emphasizing the importance of linking the
original artifact with digital tools and techniques for
visualizing and disseminating new knowledge in the
arts and humanities. Concentrating on generating new
knowledge from content derived from these maps,
textiles and other objects enhances the importance of
the DCO. This allows improved access, interpretation
and preservation of fragile items of significant cultural

Digital Humanities 2011

heritage. However the extracted information is only
as important as the strength of the collaborative
partnerships set up to create a constant iterative
loop for access to and interpretation of new scholarly
and scientific information. This requires a strong and
committed association between previously disparate
fields to incorporate and share the generation of new
knowledge by mining additional data and forging new
advances in humanities research. These related but
previously disparate disciplines comprise humanities
scholars, scientists, researchers, technology and
data management specialists to form an open
yet interconnected digital exchange of humanities
research.

Approaching the Coasts of
Utopia: Visualization Strategies
for Mapping Early Modern
Paratexts
Galey, Alan

alan.galey@utoronto.ca
University of Toronto, Canada

1. Introduction
No one reads or writes a book alone. Proof may be
found in the paratextual letters and other prefatory
material that often accompanies a book into the world
to meet its readers. This is especially true of early
modern books, whose prefatory letters stand as a
threshold where the book’s material and symbolic
production come together—sometimes as a wellexecuted plan (ex.: the 1518 editions of More’s
Utopia), and sometimes as a collision of intentions
(ex.: the 1590 edition of Spenser’s Faerie Queene,
or the 1623 Shakespeare First Folio). However, printbased methods of representing paratextual networks
—especially in their temporal dimension, across
multiple editions and translations—tend to emphasize
the published book as product, at the expense of
the book as a process. This paper takes the textual
tradition of Thomas More’s Utopia, with its unfolding
process of paratextual change between editions, as a
test case for the design of an open-source interface
component to help digital editors visualize networks of
paratexts in early modern books.
The study of paratexts has been reinvigorated in
recent years, crossing national and period boundaries
in the tradition of Gerard Genette’s Paratexts, but
more recently drawing energy from intersections
between book history and digital humanities as
interdisciplinary fields. Building on ongoing research
on the digital modelling and visualization of paratexts
and similar materials (Fekete & Dufournaud, 2000;
Monella, 2008; Johnson), this paper argues that
creating a digital visualization component for mapping
has two benefits: first that a well-designed digital
visualization can represent the structured fluidity and
temporality of publication as a process that unfolds
in time; and second, that the process of creating
such a visualization affords a reciprocal opportunity
to interrogate the digital tools and systems we use to
represent the past.
132

This paper develops its argument in four sections:
1. Research context: archive and interface in digital
textual studies
2. Utopia as a modelling challenge
3. Visualization strategies
4. Conclusion: visualization prototypes as essays
The small-scale project outlined in this paper is part
of a larger project titled Archive and Interface in
Digital Textual Studies: From Cultural History to Critical
Design, funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities
Research Council of Canada. This project is premised
on two linked arguments. The first is that we need to
understand how the figure of the archive operates in
the cultural imagination, and how perceptions of digital
archives are partly coded in advance by historical fears
and desires about the continuity of knowledge. The
second premise is that we need to develop traditions
of digital interface design native to the humanities,
and which reflect the humanities’ uniquely valuable
understanding of the cultural histories and material
complexities of texts (Kirschenbaum, 2004; Drucker,
2011). The Archive and Interface project therefore
seeks to bridge between textual studies and the
design of digital interface tools in the humanities. It
does so first by investigating the cultural history of
the humanities archive through case studies such
as Utopia, and second by building an online library
of interface components designed to be part of that
cultural history.
The interface library will focus on critical design
strategies in four key areas: textual variation (when
sources diverge in significant ways); paratexts
(documents such as prefatory letters, often published
with literary works in complex configurations);
materiality (the relation of physical documents to
digital versions); and performance (the relation of
written texts to reading or enactment in physical
spaces). This project’s interface library focuses on
putting humanities-designed interface components in
the hands of electronic editors, and disseminating the
methods by which those components may be created
and modified by the larger community of computing
humanists (the open-source model).
Granting that large-scale editing systems like
Anastasia and Edition Production & Presentation
Technology have their place in the digital humanities,
this paper will argue that small-scale and (relatively)
rapidly prototyped interface components, built by
individuals or small groups with inexpensive tools, can
reflect the critical, experimental nature of humanities
design in ways that large projects cannot. Such

Digital Humanities 2011

experimental capacity and structural flexibility is
necessary in digital humanities projects if they are to
learn from challenging materials like Utopia, and not
simply take their representability for granted.

3. Utopia as a Modelling Challenge
The specific nature of Utopia’s challenge to a digital
editor is that Utopia’s publication, as a collaborative
project between early modern humanists, thematizes
the very ideals and anxieties about the dissemination
of knowledge that digital humanists have inherited. The
book form—and by extension, the emergent network
of humanist print culture—is not merely a delivery
system for Utopia, but also one of its chief objects of
scrutiny. In particular, Utopia simultaneously embodies
and critiques the early modern archive with unusual
perspicacity. This paper’s analysis follows Warren
Wooden and John Wall by approaching Utopia “not as
an object of knowledge but as an occasion for an act
of perception, an instrument for ‘seeing’ designed to
call attention to what is involved in perception” (1985,
p. 233). In this light, Utopia itself serves as a kind of
visualization of the early modern humanist archive of
texts.
We know from correspondence that More began
writing Utopia with what is now the second book. From
a reader’s perspective, the text was written in reverse,
with book 1 (written second) placed before book 2
(written first), and various prefatory materials (written
last) accumulating before book 1. These prefatory
materials—the letters, verses, diagrams, and maps
that constitute the paratext of Utopia—increase and
vary across the four editions published from 1516 to
1518, and change even more radically in subsequent
early modern and modern editions.
It is common for modern editions to completely remove
or reconfigure Utopia’s carefully constructed paratexts
(Allen, 1963). Yet, paradoxically, there may be no
single ideal configuration of paratexts, making the
interpretation of Utopia as a material text especially
reliant on representational methods and tools (Jardine,
1993; Leslie, 1998; Vallée, 2004; Kinney, 2005). Those
tools have tended to take printed form, culminating in
Terence Cave’s printed guide to Utopia’s paratextual
tradition. However, Utopia can be taken as an early
experiment itself in humanist print culture, no less than
the digital experiments we discuss at digital humanities
conferences, which makes Utopia anything but passive
material for representation and editing.

4. Visualization Strategies
Given Utopia’s playful, experimental nature, this paper
argues for the need for a visualization strategy based
not on static representation, as in traditional forms
of data visualization that represents the results of
analysis, but based rather on the idea of modelling.
Unlike a static representation, a digital model
embodies the process-friendly dynamism we expect
of digital visualizations, but also a certain “roughand-ready” form and heuristic flexibility (McCarty,
2004). These latter qualities we associate not with
commercial software but with the community-designed
code libraries found at SourceForge and similar places,
which serve as the dissemination model for the Archive
and Interface project’s visualization components. (On
humanities approaches to visualization, see Drucker,
2010, and other articles in the same special issue of
Poetess Archive Journal on “Visualizing the Archive.”)
The design methodology for the interface library will
be consistent with Ajax web applications, a type
of architecture that distributes processing between
a server and a user’s web browser, and which
integrates well with XML databases and objectoriented design. HTML 5’s new capabilities on
the client side permit animation and time-based
interactivity to be incorporated into interfaces in ways
that used to be exclusive to Flash. This paper will
include a brief demonstration of a browser-based
interface component that uses animation to model
paratextual change over time. The prototype presented
here will rely on the encoding structures proposed
by Monella (2008), but will approach the topic from
the browser and interface side instead of drawing
conclusions about the encoding.

5. Conclusion: Visualization Prototypes as
Essays
The two strategies proposed above, modelling and
browser-based design, will serve to illustrate the
paper’s broader conclusion that a digital humanities
project organized around many small interface
prototypes may yield more publishable components,
respond more quickly to critical discourse about the
material, and involve less risk than a single, large
interface project. The nature of paratexts calls for
an interpretive approach to digital representation,
especially with material as complex as More’s Utopia.
This paper concludes that the humanistic critical
tradition, embodied by Utopia as a collaborative project
in publishing technologies of its own time, calls digital
humanists to think of their visualizations and interface
prototypes not just as finished tools, which emphasize
133

Digital Humanities 2011

utility, but also as essays that put forward arguments
and serve as pretexts for debate—like Utopia itself.

1. Introduction
Digital Humanities (DH) has been described as an
'emerging' field for some time now but many (Borgman
2009; Friedlander 2009; Presner 2009) agree that
this is a crucial moment for the discipline. The DH
community now has established research methods,
scholarly conferences and journals (Borgman 2009),
DH centres and labs (Svensson 2010; van den Heuvel
et al. 2010) and MA studies (Clement 2010). However,
it could be argued that an important area for further
development is the true internalization of the DH
community. Up to now much of the discussion has
centered on DH projects in a handful of mainly
English speaking countries (Terras 2006). In order to
consolidate as a discipline, an important challenge
for the DH community is to extend its international
reach and incorporate work from a broader range of
academic institutions and languages.
One of the main issues of course, is attempting
to integrate with groups of scholars that have not
necessarily identified themselves yet as a community
or do not even know that DH exists. Our project has
four main objectives:

present a preliminary report on the DH situation in
Mexico in particular.
To our knowledge this type of work has not been done
before, in particular for Latin America. The fact that
there has been little participation of Latin American
scholars does not necessarily imply that no DH work
is being done in this region but could be rather a
lack of connection with the DH community. Japan for
example, reports that despite having a long tradition in
DH projects, one problem has been cooperating with
similar projects overseas (Muller 2010).

2. Methodology
It is well documented that finding digital humanities
resources (Dunning 2006; Pappa et al. 2006, Warwick
et al 2006) and DH tools (Juola 2008) can be a
difficult task and charting an unknown territory poses
further challenges. We decided that workshops would
allow us to both raise awareness of DH as well
as serving as exploratory method to identify key
scholars, projects and local issues. Additionally time
and financial constraints were a major factor. At a later
date we hope to use more quantitative methods such
as a national survey.
Two workshops were carried out at the Universidad
Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM). As there is no
record of DH activity in Mexico it was difficult to define
where to start and so we relied heavily on personal
experience and contacts to produce a list of possible
participants. We contacted everybody we knew who
had experience working on a DH project and asked
them in turn to invite other participants in order to
generate a snowball effect. The invitation included a
very broad definition of DH projects. The workshops
generated a large amount of interest and were well
attended.
In order to provide a framework for the discussion we
identified seven key topics from the literature:

1. raise awareness about DH

1. organizational context including institutional
recognition and support (Siemens et al. 2010;
Warwick 2008b)

2. identify key scholars and projects

2. planning and development intellectual

3. investigate key local issues in the development of
DH projects

3. property and copyright (Rehm 2007); human
resources and training (Warwick 2009)

4. consolidate a community and find ways of linking
with the international DH community

4. dissemination and use (Warwick 2008a)

The aim of this paper is to present our initial experience
with two workshops as a methodological approach to
investigating DH work in an unknown landscape and

5. completion and sustainability (Brown et al. 2009;
Kretzschmar 2009; Sewell 2009)
6. digital humanist career (Siemens et al. 2010).

135

Digital Humanities 2011

These topics were addressed as a series of
questions which participants answered reflecting on
their particular experience and the projects they had
worked on.

3. Results and Discussion
The first workshop had fifteen participants and
the second twelve. Table 1 shows a breakdown
of participants by subject. Examples of the types
of DH projects carried out by the participants
were digital collections and libraries (modern
short novels and poetry, XIX century manuscripts
marked in TEI), linguistics (text mining, corpus
building, corpus of Mexican Spanish), digital images
(research in pre Hispanic mural paintings, visualization
archeological sites) and Anthropology (sound files for
linguistics research indigenous languages). Almost all
participants were project leaders, with the exception of
two programmers, one MA publishing student and one
graphic designer.

Of the people attending only a few were aware of the
field of DH. Some had links with international projects
(such as Biblioteca Virtual Cervantes) but in general
most work was local and individual. Participants were
pleased to discover "that there are other people like
me".
Almost all projects are personal and not institutional
initiatives. Several scholars remarked that university
authorities had a vague idea of the importance of
registering and managing digital materials but that
this institutional support in practice lacked coherent
policies or structures for them to have any real impact.
None of the projects for example, had any specific
physical location assigned and many had to improvise
working spaces in order to cope with human resources
and equipment.

136

A few people remarked however that working
marginally was actually a good thing. "Being ignored
can also be an advantage. Being independent and
invisible to the institution allows you to be dynamic and
creative".
Surprisingly, funding was not a problem for any of
the projects. Most scholars applied and received
funding from government or the UNAM. However,
quantities were not particularly large (around 15,000
US dollars) and no project had permanent institutional
funding. Participants did not mention a lack of
access to computational technologies which had been
suggested as a possible problem for DH projects in
developing countries (Terras 2006).
Projects were rarely documented with the exception
of Linguistics. This is similar to other DH projects
worldwide (Warwick 2009). Due to one to three year
funding periods many felt that they were in a race
against time to complete and documentation was left
out.
Finding, training and retaining human resources are
also key issues. All participants agreed that it is difficult
to find human resources with the necessary skills
and training was required. Additionally participants
themselves went through a steep learning process
whilst developing their project and found little learning
support. In terms of training in Mexico there are
no DH centres or courses. However, a couple of
MA DH related classes are in development. Sharing
information and pooling resources was considered
fundamental towards developing the field. Participants
noted the urgent need to compile best practice and
guidelines as there seemed to be duplication of efforts
and no communication.
Long term sustainability of resources is a major issue.
For example, many scholars had purchased their own
server to host the project as there are no university
guidelines for hosting projects. However, it is not
clear what will happen once the servers have to be
replaced, or if the researcher left the university. In
other cases, projects were hosted at the Computing
Services department but usually as a personal rather
than a formal collaboration. Others have hosted their
projects on external servers, sometimes even at their
own personal expense. As one participant remarked
"when does a project become a university service and
therefore somebody else's responsibility?" This is a
common issue for DH (Brown et al. 2009; Kretzschmar
2009; Sewell 2009). We detected a notable absence
of the library community whose skills are essential to
these issues. Participants were aware of preservation
but had not addressed the issue at all.

Digital Humanities 2011

Another major issue was evaluation and recognition
of DH work. Many felt that their work, although
funded, was later not taken into account for evaluation
purposes. However, it was also noted that it is difficult
for evaluation committees who have no experience
or knowledge about these types of projects to
assess them. Many had worked individually with their
departmental boards but it was agreed that providing
tools, acting as a consultative body and lobbying
collectively would be a more effective approach.

4. Conclusions
Results from the workshop indicate that forming a DH
community is possible as we found sufficient projects,
scholars and interest to sustain a working group.
All participants were enthusiastic about forming part
of a local DH group. Workshops were by invitation
only but have since resulted in other DH scholars
coming forward and wanting to participate. Initial
results indicate that issues and challenges regarding
DH projects are similar to other countries and
collaboration would be possible and fruitful. However,
with some issues such as university and governmental
recognition and support, guidelines and best practices
and community awareness there appears to be a
significant lag behind other countries. One main
difference is the almost complete absence of the
library community and this issue should be addressed.
Main challenges are now: to discover and register
more research and projects; develop best practices
and guidelines in Spanish; incorporate the library
community, build a directory of DH scholars; expand
the group and develop mechanisms to increase
national and international collaboration. In the next
few months we will continue to work on more specific
actions and report on them in due course.

This paper reflects on the process of designing and
building a documentation and archiving tool named
CloudPad on the basis of its first evaluation at
Stanford Libraries and the San Francisco Art Institute
in September 2010. The paper explores the value of
CloudPad and its ability to document individual users’
replay of an artwork within the context of performance
documentation and new media archiving, speculating
on its possible use within a number of curatorial,
educational and creative contexts that are relevant to
digital humanities.
The CloudPad was developed in 2010 by a team
in Horizon RCUK-funded digital economy research
and involved staff in performance studies and
computer science from the Universities of Exeter and
Nottingham, with partners from Stanford Libraries,
the Ludwig Boltzman Institute Media.Art.Research,
The San Francisco Art Institute, British Library,
Blast Theory, and the University of Sheffield. The
work developed out of the team’s intention to
research novel theoretical and practical approaches
for the documentation and archiving of mixed reality
performances and artworks that span both digital
and physical entities (Benford and Giannachi 2011),
allowing users to engage with the materials creatively
over time and from different locations. The project
benefitted from previous research conducted by
138

Digital Humanities 2011

members of the team through the AHRC-funded
Presence project (2004-9), which used second life
and a wiki to document practices spanning from
performance art, to video art and new media,
including work in virtual reality CAVE, and the
EPSRC-funded Creator project (2008-9) which used
an e-science tool, the digital replay system, to
generate synchronised annotations about a mixed
reality performance (DRS). The project also benefitted
from the findings of the e-dance project (2007- 9),
which was jointly funded by AHRC, JISC and EPSRC,
and conducted by colleagues from the Universities
of Bedfordshire, Leeds, Manchester and Open
University. This adopted access grid technologies
for developing new approaches to choreographic
composition, involving the use of the Memetic toolkit for
recording, replaying and annotating sessions in access
grid. Finally, the project was developed in dialogue with
artworks such as Lynn Hershman Leeson’s RAW/WAR
feminist film archives (2010), sosolimited’s interactive
archival performances, and current thinking in new
media documentation (e.g. Costello 2005, Depocas et
al 2003, Jones and Muller 2008 and Dekker 2011,
among others).
Technically the CloudPad was designed as a
customisable web-based platform aiming to facilitate
the synchronised playback and mash-up of cloudbased media entities such as video or audio files,
as well as webpages and photographic materials,
together with layers of user annotations. It took
a novel approach to the archiving and replay of
pervasive media experiences by making use of Web
2.0 technologies (DiNucci 1999) rather than grid
technologies. CloudPad users were empowered to
view the repository as a living document in which they
could leave their own impression of an experience
(both of the original event recordings as well as
any thematic connections or annotations provided by
other visitors and subject experts). Previous interactive
systems designed for the replay of events for analysis
lack this level of emergent reflection (see Brundell
2008), treating the corpus of recorded material as
essentially immutable. To enable this, the CloudPad
made use of internet-based storage, which means that
media from a wide variety of different sources could
be included in a presentation (for example YouTube
videos can be included and synchronised with images
from Flickr). This was accomplished by the use of
HTML5 (see w3.org), an emerging web standard that
enables collaborative interactive applications to be
developed which run inside a web browser (Murray
2005).

As an initial form of content to assess the operation of
the CloudPad we utilised a ‘bespoke’ documentation
of Blast Theory’s Rider Spoke that was recorded
by our team when the work occurred at the ars
electronica festival in Linz in 2009. Rider Spoke
is a location-based game for cyclists developed
by Blast Theory in collaboration with Mixed Reality
Laboratory at the University of Nottingham as part
of the European research project IPerG. The work
encouraged participants to cycle around a city in order
to record personal memories and make statements
about their past, present and future that were
associated with particular locations (see figure 1).

To collect a documentation that addressed
the complexity of this work, we developed a
hybrid approach. This included the collection
of documentations pertaining to the artists and
technologists’ descriptions of the works (in terms of
original aims, interim analyses and final evaluations),
as well as documentations of the user experience
(see Jones and Muller 2008 and Depocas et al
2003), the latter recorded from a variety of points of

139

Digital Humanities 2011

view (e.g. first person, third person) and through a
number of technologies (e.g., video, GPS, Wi-Fi) and
perspectives (see figures 2, 3 and 4).

and third person perspectives in a canonic trajectory.

The overall analytical approach was interdisciplinary,
thus including different and potentially even contrasting
accounts of the event (see Chamberlain et al 2010).
These accounts were presented through a number
of historic, canonic and participant ‘trajectories’ (see
figure 5).

By historic trajectories we defined a historic event,
i.e. a participant’s experience as documented in a
video; by canonic trajectories we defined an expert
user’s set of annotations through these materials; and
by participant trajectories we defined the CloudPad
user’s own annotations (Giannachi et al 2010). This
architecture does not privilege a single viewpoint and
encourages creative use of both the historic materials
and their canonic annotations. Arguably, every replay,
producing participant trajectories, re-constitutes the
work.
The CloudPad evaluation showed that users did not
only envisage adopting the CloudPad for purposes of
documentation and archiving, but also wanted to use
it curatorially, to present work to others and engage
users in annotating materials, for example in an online
exhibition, academically, to write ‘visual essays’, and
creatively, to make artwork. We have seen that the
CloudPad offers scholars, artists and students the
possibility to document, archive, curate and create
synchronised variable media mash-ups from existing
digital resources. These mash-ups, which show how
users have engaged with the original documentation
stored on CloudPad, build an invaluable resource
for those who may be interested in how a core
documentation or archive is navigated and interpreted
over time. In other words, the CloudPad is not only a
documentation and archiving tool, it also documents
and archives itself, generating contextual footprints

the advances generated by this particular functionality
in terms of performance documentation, preservation,
and re-enactment.

Moving Beyond Anecdotal
History
Gibbs, Fred

fwgibbs@gmail.com
George Mason University

Now almost fifty years old, Walter Houghton’s seminal
work, The Victorian Frame of Mind, 1830-1870, has
influenced generations of scholars of the nineteenth
century and remains the primary introduction to
Victorian thought that every student in the field reads.
From a close reading of famous Victorian writers such
as John Stuart Mill and Thomas Carlyle, Houghton
argued that the Victorians were characterized by
specific, common personality traits such as optimism,
hero worship, and earnestness. Houghton believed
that these traits were visible in the rise (or decline)
in the use of particular words and phrases, such as
an increasing use of “light,” “sunlight,” and “hope” as
illustrative of their optimistic world view.
Despite the enormous impact of The Victorian Frame
of Mind on generations of scholars across the
humanities, it has not been accepted uncritically.
Many concerns stem from Houghton’s myopic textual
methodology: generalizing the character of a people
—“the Victorians”—from the words of a select few.
Although Houghton cites hundreds of primary sources
in his bibliography, his book has been characterized
as anecdotal, elite intellectual history. Despite such
criticisms, Victorianists have been able neither to
thoroughly assess the general validity of Houghton’s
theses nor to offer alternatives.
New digital tools and the vast digital library of Google
Books now allow us to conduct a comprehensive
survey of Victorian writing—not just the well-known
Mills and Carlyles, but tens of thousands of lesserknown or even forgotten authors—to test whether the
Victorians truly did use the kinds of words and phrases
that Houghton claimed they did. Did metaphors of
hope actually increase in real terms between 1830 and
1870? Or was this only true for the dozen prominent
writers he examined for his chapter on optimism? How
can we complicate Houghton’s characterizations and
understand change over time through the vast index
of Google Books? Can we refine the timeline for the
emergence of his characteristics, moving beyond the
disturbingly neat, rounded-year boundaries he set for
his book? How can we correlate historical events with
disturbances in the linguistic data? To what extent can
142

we separate cultural history from printing history with a
large corpus of digitized literature?
Dan Cohen, my colleague at the Center for History
and New Media, and I have begun work on a project
to answer these very questions. With the help of
a Google Digital Humanities Grant, we’re attempting
what Franco Moretti calls a “distant reading” of the
Victorians. My paper will explain how we’ve gone about
querying the data available through Google Books,
how we’ve been able to make sense of and interpret
the results, and how we’ve dealt with the messiness
of the data. I hope to solicit feedback about our
methodologies and conclusions as part of a larger
discussion about how the Google Books corpus (and
similar datasets) could be made more usable for largescale data mining projects relevant to the diverse
research interests of the audience. How far can we
push our methodologies beyond testing certain theses
in order to allow the texts to speak for themselves?
In terms of the Victorians, some preliminary results
have proven quite intriguing. For example, the number
of books published with “universal” in the title declined
steadily throughout the century, but earlier than most
interpretations in the secondary literature point out. A
look at published titles suggests that the terms “God,”
“Christian,” and “Bible” follow rather different contours,
though explanations are not immediately apparent.
Similarly, how can we explain the striking publication
parallels between the terms “belief” and “Aristotle”?
The median number of titles that use the word
“hope” does not significantly change between 1830
and 1870: does this cast some doubt on Houghton’s
characterizations? Or does it simply indicate that book
titles are not an accurate gauge of popular sentiment?
We have not yet been able to examine the full texts
from the publications that are being counted, but
we hope to do that soon. To what extent will a
more sophisticated linguistic analysis of the full texts
reinforce or contradict what the titles alone tell us?
Does this have implications for similar large-scale
research methodologies?

Historic Interpretation,
Preservation, and Augmented
Reality in Falmouth Jamaica

Despite the ground-breaking work of graphics
visionaries like Alan Sutherland1 and Ed Catmull2
in the 1960s and 1970s, which unlocked computer
screens as interactive tools, hardware portability
issues have constrained computer interaction to
a two-dimensional space which often simulates
the real world. However, the considerable market
growth of sophisticated mobile devices over the last
several years has begun to push the boundaries
of interaction in virtual environments. Instead of
experiencing a simulated environment sitting at a
computer, users are shifting to experiencing physical
environments with a computing device capable of
enriching their subjectie experience of the space. The
success of augmented reality systems like BionicEye,
RobotVision, TATAugmented ID, and Layar provides
glimpses at how this technology might be leveraged by
cultural heritage institutions, individual academics, and
even local, municpal officials, to provide opportunities
for students and the general public to interact with
space and place in new and exciting ways.
The University of Virginia’s Department of Architectural
History holds its training-oriented field school, under
the direction of Professor Louis Nelson, in the city of
Falmouth Jamaica each year. Falmouth is a fruitful
city for study because of its unique history, which
makes it the best preserved example of Georgian
architecture in the Caribbean. Founded in 1769, the
city was originally designed as the main northern
port for the island’s thriving sugar trade. Tied closely
to the infamous “Triangle-trade”, the slave-based
sugar economy allowed the city to grow until the
emancipation of slaves in the British Empire in 1840.
After 1840, the town saw a significant decline and
experienced very little construction over the next 170
years, preserving its architecture and urban design as
an early nineteenth-century time capsule.

In 2009, the Jamaican government approved
development of a cruise ship terminal in Falmouth. Its
first ships are scheduled for docking in the summer of
2011. The predicted influx of tourism to the town will
be an economic boon to residents, but will also bring
significant changes to the architectural identity of the
town. The 11-acre port is of such size that, while ships
are docked, they will tower over the Trewlany Parish
Church of St. Peter, the tallest building in the town.
New dining and recreation facilities will be constructed
around the terminal, and a simplified interpretation of
early nineteenth-century life will be constructed for the
enjoyment of tourists. This will result a better standard
of living for most residents of the town, but will mean
the loss of an historical laboratory for architecture. As
businesses sprout up, residents will be pushed away
from areas around the terminal and century-old houses
will be torn down and replaced with store-fronts.
Realizing that the introduction of the cruise terminal
to the city will forever alter the architectural identity of
the town, the UVa Architectural History Field School
recently shifted its focus from deep analysis of a
handful of buildings in a single summer, to a more
general effort to survey the status of the buildings
of the entire city. This survey includes measured
sketches, colorcoding of a given structure’s overall
condition, images of the structure as it stands today,
and information on when the building was constructed,
construction material, and other items of interest
to architectural historians. These findings were then
submitted to UVa Library’s Special Collections for longterm archiving.
Sensing a real opportunity to provide access to this
important work, the Scholars’ Lab partnered with Louis
Nelson, chair of the Architectural History department,
to investigate ways to make this nearly decade’s
worth of research available to a wider audience.
We identified three groups of users for the content:
academics interested in the underlying data of the city,
government officials who need to plan city restoration
efforts, and tourists interested in finding out more
about the town they will visit. The Scholars’ Lab was
particularly interested in interface design decisions that
would serve each of these communities well.
In order to provide different mechanisms of access
for three distinct user groups, we employed several
open-source tools to create a solution that would
expose this valuble architectural and historical data
to a large and varied audience. Leveraging our
own expertise in open-source Geographic Information
Systems infrastructure3 with the flexibility of the Omeka
collections and exhibits framework, the Scholars’ Lab

143

Digital Humanities 2011

has constructed several different ways in which these
different audiences may interact with library-curated
spatial data.
In order to allow city planners access to the
underlying data, maps originally drawn in AutoCad
were converted to a GIS format and loaded on
to a web-accessible server. Web services were
created to allow high-end users of GIS software
access to the information with proprietary tools like
ArcGIS. We then utilized those same web services
to create map interactions within Omeka using the
open source mapping library OpenLayers. Images
and metadata (along with the full architectural survey
report) were uploaded to Omeka and a custom VRA
Core metadata standard was created to allow more
appropriate description of the architectural elements
in the collection. Long-form academic essays are
also in the process of being written for approximately
30 of the most important structures in the city.
These will be presented along with maps highlighting
where important structures are located, to allow visual
methods for browsing the collections to function in
tandem with scholarly interventions to highlight specific
structures of interest. Importantly, this approach also
allows us to expose underlying geographic information
as web services, allowing other scholars to reuse the
information.
While the site boasts other advanced features,
including a faceted Solr-based search, we also wanted
to explore methods for exposing the same data
in new ways to the different target groups for the
project. With the growth of web-enabled smart devices,
we plan to try two experiments at the Vernacular
Architecture Forum’s Annual Meeting, in June 2011
in Falmouth, Jamaica. The first will place QR codes
at selected structures around the town to allow
individuals with web-enabled phones to access all of
the information about the structure presented on the
Scholars’ Lab website. We are also building a Layarbased augmented reality browser for the city which
will allow individuals with smart phones (iPhones and
Android-based devices) to install a simple application
that will overlay information about buildings on a
viewport, accessed simply by pointing their phones at
the building.
This is an ongoing project, with field experiments and
user feedback scheduled to be conducted before the
Digital Humanities 2011 conference. We hope to model
a technical approach to providing access to librarycurated information for multiple audiences, using
different technological approaches and techniques to
frame the data not only in terms of scholarly use, but for
tourism and cultural heritage appreciation, and for the
144

more practical employment of the data by city planners
to optimize restoration efforts. We also hope that these
tools will help raise awareness about the fragility of the
town to tourists, and can act as a way to expose UVa
students’ and scholars’ research in multiple formats
to those interested in underlying historical and spatial
data, and the multimedia and embodied arguments
which have been crafted using new tools and methods.

The Digital Materiality of Early
Christian Visual Culture: Building
on John 20:24-29
Heath, Sebastian

sebastian.heath@nyu.edu
Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York
University

This paper explores the nature of digital materiality
as it resides in the visual and written culture of
Early Christianity. Within archaeology and related
disciplines, “materiality” is a theoretical approach that
focuses on physical things - such as objects, books,
or buildings - as one starting point for building an
understanding of past thought and behavior (White
2009). As a term, "digital materiality" does not yet
have a fixed meaning and can refer to the physical
manifestations of the computer age (Manoff 2006),
to the processes by which digital representations
become physical architecture (Gramazio and Kohler
2008) or to the effects of digital information in the
modern world (Leonardi 2010). Here, I mean "digital
materiality" as the transport of information about the
material culture of past societies, and particularly
the material culture of Early Christianity. Looking
for fluid relationships between thought and object in
ancient evidence suggests that "digital materiality"
is an appropriate metaphor for both recovering past
interactions with material culture and for describing the
role of networked information in modern archaeological
and art historical scholarship. It is this intersection of
past and present that is of particular interest. While
stressing potential, this paper also looks to the practical
consequences of current efforts to digitize ancient
activity that survives in material form.
Existing virtual representations have already exposed
clear overlaps between the written word as object
and the manifestation of those concepts in visual
media. The Codex Sinaiticus is a fourth century codex
bible removed from Saint Catharine’s monastery on
the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt in the 19th century
and now largely in the British Museum. Its early
date makes it plausibly the first extant bible as that
term is conceived in Christian terms. Most of the
surviving pages of the codex are available online at the
site http://codexsinaiticus.org/ . Among the passages
found there is John 20:24-29, where the disciple
Thomas, of “doubting Thomas” fame, demands to
touch the wounds of the resurrected Jesus when he

appears to his followers. The passage ends with the
exhortation, “20:29. Because you have seen me, you
have believed; blessed are those who have not seen
and yet have believed.”
The traction this concept had in Early Christian
culture is clear from a hammered gold disk
produced in Egypt and now in the collection of
the American Numismatic Society that has a stable
digital representation available at the URI http://
numismatics.org/collection/0000.999.51006 . This
physical object quotes the text of John 20:29 while
illustrating Thomas in the act of touching Christ. This
paper stresses that the modern opportunity to engage
in such a self-referential illustration of the materiality
of thought in the Later Roman Mediterranean is a
serendipitous result of independent efforts to digitize
the material record of that time and place. Just as
the creation of the surviving material record should
be recognized as the cumulative action of many
individuals, it is likely that exploration of that record
will be enabled by many projects and institutions
working within their own areas of expertise and with
content specific to their domain (Heath 2010, Terras
2010). It is the interactions of a series of self-digitizing
and independent communities – here Early Christian
textual studies and Numismatics – that can recover
relationships between physical object and human
thought that is a primary goal of materiality as a
methodological approach.
It is, of course, important to recognize that while the
Internet will make evident the material implications
of past human thought and action, it will not of
its own bring scholars into direct contact with the
material culture they study. Digital Humanities as
applied to archaeology and visual culture will usually
mean working with surrogates: one cannot download
an object, one can only see its representation . The
network does not take us to a site, it only provides
access to descriptions and pictures. Digital materiality
is therefore an act of transmission (Liu 2004) so that its
deficiencies leave it open to criticism.
Trends within the study of textual evidence as
embodied in manuscripts suggest that this observation
is not a barrier to analytical progress. Projects such
as the Codex Sinaiticus digitization effort are showing
that digital access to manuscripts is returning the
material to a central place in the study of primary
sources that had been abstracted in critical editions.
The digitized page images show in great detail the
large number of variants and corrections that make
plain that written evidence for the ancient world
does not exist independently of its physical media.
The Homer Multi-Text project (http://chs.harvard.edu/
145

Digital Humanities 2011

chs/homer_multitext) is self-consciously engaged in
enabling virtual access to multiple manuscripts of the
Iliad and Odyssey that range from the Hellenistic to
Medieval periods. Such initiatives indicate that material
and thought become meaningfully unified in a digital
domain. Accordingly, digital materiality is not a poor
substitute for direct autopsy of material culture. Rather
than de-emphasizing the physical, Digital Humanities
will bring it to the fore. But it needs to be pointed out
that at this moment, the best critical editions of the
New Testament (Aland and Nestle 2006, Aland et al.
2006), with rich apparatus for the Gospel of John, is
not available online so that commercial interests are
an impediment to to the study of the text, whether
considered as an idealized abstraction or a material
object. This suggests that the constituent components
of both modern and ancient digital materiality are at
a transitional point where "primary sources" are more
accessible than "secondary works".
It is particularly important to stress this point when
we recognize that it is no longer possible within
archaeological scholarship to have hands-on access
to all relevant material (Stewart 2008). To recall
the ending sentiment of the doubting Thomas story,
“blessed are those who have not seen and yet have
believed.” This can be applied to the current state
of archaeological and material studies and lightly
reformulated as an invitation to both make use of the
full potential of material and textual sources on the
internet, and to aggressively pursue such availability.

Image Markup Tool 2.0
Holmes, Martin

mholmes@uvic.ca
Humanities Computing Media Centre, University of
Victoria

Timney, Meagan

mbtimney@uvic.ca
Electronic Textual Cultures Laboratory, University of
Victoria

This paper discusses the re-development of The Image
Markup Tool in two parts: (1) as a crossplatform
desktop application and (2) as a web-based, html5
standard, client-side browser application. Currently, a
few text-based tools allow for markup of documents
(most often) in XML/TEI. They range from legacy
software such as the Analytical System Tools
and SGML/XML Integration Applications (Anastasia)1
and Editing Digital Interactive Texts in an Online
Network (EDITION),2 to more recent projects such
as eLaborate,3 TextGrid,4 and TEXTvre.5 TextGrid
uses a collaborative document markup interface, as
well as a project and user management system to
facilitate the markup of texts. TEXTvre, which will be
modeled on TextGrid, has been described as a “a
working exemplar VRE for textual scholarship.” While
each of these tools offers specific methods of textbased editing, The Image Markup Tool is image-based,
allowing for the markup of encoded digital images of
remediated textual objects.
We are building on the current iteration of The Image
Markup Tool (v1), developed by Martin Holmes at the
University of Victoria. Version 1 of the Image Markup
Tool was first written in 2006, and has gone through
several versions. It was originally conceived as part of
the project Le mariage sous L'Ancien Régime,6 where
it was used to mark up engravings (Carlin, Haswell and
Holmes 2006; Carlin and Holmes 2008). Early versions
of the tool used SVG code embedded into a TEI file to
delineate areas of interest on an image, but the current
version makes use of the Facsimile module recently
added to the TEI schema, which enables the use of
native TEI elements to define rectangular “zones” on
“surfaces” (often pages) which are part of a facsimile.
However, version 1 of the Image Markup Tool suffers
from a number of serious limitations, most of which
were apparent from its inception. Firstly, it allows only
rectangular areas (hereafter “zones”) to be specified on

images. This was in line with the original specification
of the Facsimile module in TEI, in which <zone>
elements were similarly constrained, but users have
been demanding the ability to specify polygonal
shapes ever since the first release, and recent
modifications to the TEI schema now allow the use of
polygonal <zone> elements. Secondly, IMT version 1
can handle only one image per file. This was sufficient
for its original projected use as part of the Mariage
project, which focused on individual engravings, but
makes the tool inadequate for serious facsimile work;
most documents have multiple surfaces or pages.
Thirdly, the program can handle only a one-to-one
relationship between a single <zone> on a <surface>,
and a single <div> in the <body> of the document.
This is inadequate. It is a common requirement to link,
for instance, a single block of text on an image to
an original transcription, a modernized version of the
transcription, and an editorial note or interpretation.
Similarly, a single <div> (or in fact any other element) in
the body of a text might conceivably be linked to more
than one <zone>; multiple views of a particular surface
or page might be provided in the facsimile, each with an
equivalent <zone>. Finally, IMT version 1 was written
as a Windows application using Borland Delphi. It will
run on Linux using Wine, but there is no simple way to
run it on a Macintosh computer.
Nevertheless, IMT version 1 has a number of
strengths. As a compiled desktop application,
using a very sophisticated open-source graphics
library (Graphics32), it can to do high-quality
resampling of images on-the-fly, enabling effective
and rapid zooming of high-resolution images. Most
file operations are very fast, and the interface itself is
simple and relatively easy to use. For Windows and
Linux users, it is easy to download and install.
The desktop version of IMT 2 is being written
using Nokia's QT Creator tools. This will enable us
to compile the application for Windows, Mac and
Linux. Our intention is to build on the strengths of
version 1 -- in particular, the speed and efficiency of
graphics handling and file i/o, and the user-friendliness
and simplicity of the interface -- while adding three
important improvements:
1. Handling of an unlimited number of images.
2. Many-to-many linking between <zone>s and any
elements with @xml:id attributes in the <text>
section of the file.
3. Support for polygonal zones.
These screenshots of early development pilots show
how we envisage the user interface.
147

Digital Humanities 2011

so that corrections and changes can be made without
moving the file back into an XML editor.

The first shows the main window, with multiple folios
(pages) listed down the left side. Clicking on a folio
shows the corresponding image, and the polygonal
zones defined on that image (in red). The selected
zone has draggable circular nodes at all of its corners.
The context menu for the selected zone is displayed,
showing that the zone is linked to three different
elements in the <text>.

The second screenshot shows the corresponding
dialog box, where the user can select an element in
the <text> of the TEI file for linking to a zone. Three
views of the file are available: the first is a read-only
syntax-highlighted text view, the second consists of a
list of all the @xml:id attributes in the file, along with a
text box which can be used to filter them, and the third
is an “outline” or tree view of the file. The user could
use any of these to find and select an element to be
linked to a zone. In addition, the user will be able to
edit any element in the <text> of the TEI file directly, to
add transcription, markup, @xml:id attributes, etc. We
do not envisage that the majority of XML editing will be
done in the Image Markup Tool itself; rather, the base
transcription would be done using an XML editor such
as oXygen, and the file brought into the IMT for the
definition and linking of images and zones. However, it
will be important to allow direct editing of the XML code
148

The web platform of the Image Markup Tool fills a
gap in current collaborative editing models, and will
provide a lightweight “edit-anywhere” version of the
desktop application. The web-platform will be built
for a large population of needs, but our first usercase study will be the Editing Modernism in Canada
Project (EMiC).7 Rather than following past practices
of transcribing texts and marking up transcriptions
in the creation of electronic texts, EMiC and its
partners will pioneer image-based editing, semantic
markup, analysis, and visualization of texts in a field of
emergent practices in digital-humanities scholarship.
Instead of producing reading environments based
on linear-discursive transcriptions of texts, EMiC will
produce in collaboration with its partners techniques
and technologies for encoding and interpreting the
complex relations among large collections of visual
and audial objects in non-linear reading environments.
Our rationale for a web-based browser application
includes facilitating RESTful architecture and
interoperability with other systems via API (including,
for example, Scripto,8 developed at the Centre for
History for New Media at George Mason University).
The IMT web-platform will allow a user to load images
and XML documents into a browser window (either
locally or via URL). The drawing and linking of the
polygonal <zone>s now supported in the TEI schema
are made possible with the HTML5 <canvas> element.
As in the desktop application, it is assumed that the
user will perform most TEI markup with an XML editor
(such as oXygen), but the application will also support
lightweight XML editing. The most powerful feature
of the web-based application will be the potential
to feed linked XML documents and images directly
into a collection-builder such as Omeka9 to facilitate
scholarly edition building and electronic publishing via
a suite of tools.

The Tutor's Story: A Case
Study of Mixed Authorship
Hoover, David L.

david.hoover@nyu.edu
New York University

The Victorian novelist and Christian Socialist Charles
Kingsley (1819-1875) is now known mainly for his
children’s book, Waterbabies (Kingsley 1863), though
he also wrote political and historical novels. Long
after his death, his daughter, Mary St. Leger Kingsley
Harrison (1852- 1931), discovered an unfinished and
unexpected novel manuscript entitled “The Tutor’s
Story” among his papers. Mrs. St. Leger Harrison,
writing under the name Lucas Malet, was herself
one of the most famous novelists at the turn of the
twentieth century, one who explored daring themes like
incestuous desire, lesbianism, sadism, and prostitution
(Schaffer 1996:109). Malet finished her father’s novel
and published it in 1916 (Kingsley and Malet 1916).
In her preface, Malet describes the state, size, and
nature of the manuscript, and this description gives a
fairly solid basis for assigning at least parts of the novel
to the two authors. She tells us that the beginning of
the manuscript, and so presumably also the novel, was
“fairly consecutive,” so that we can expect the early
chapters to be Kingsley's. But she also tells us that
there were other “chapters and skeletons of chapters”
from much later in the story, without further indicating
where these occur in the novel. Finally, she reports
that the plot was unresolved, and that she doubled the
size of the text in completing it (Kingsley and Malet
1916: vi). This suggests that the late chapters of the
novel are probably mostly by Malet. This complex and
difficult scenario provides a good opportunity for testing
the effectiveness and limitations of some old and some
new methods of authorship attribution, including ttests, Burrows's Delta (Burrows 2002, 2003; Hoover
2004a, 2004b), and Craig's version of Burrows's Zeta
(Craig and Kinney 2009; Hoover 2010).
As is so often true in the real world, some aspects
of this authorship problem are not exactly what one
would want. Some of Kingsley’s novels are as much
social commentary as fiction, dealing with issues like
the plight of the rural poor, poor sanitation, child labor,
and the exploitation of workers. Others are historical
novels, set in Anglo-Saxon times, during the reign of
Elizabeth I, and fifth-century Alexandria. Two others
are children’s books. Given this varied output, it is
149

Digital Humanities 2011

difficult to assemble sufficient similar Kingsley texts for
testing. Furthermore, Malet tells us that she has tried to
match her style to that of her father, and contemporary
reviews of the novel comment that the book sounds
just like Kingsley (Book Review Digest 1917). Finally,
while most of Kingsley’s fiction is third-person, this is a
first-person novel. Malet’s fiction is less varied, but it is
also mostly third-person.
In spite of these difficulties, initial PCA, Cluster
Analysis, and Delta tests on a group of novels by
Kingsley and Malet all very successfully distinguish
the two authors. Delta results remain quite accurate
even for short sections, typically about 90% accurate
for Kingsley, and often 100% accurate for Malet, even
on large numbers of 500-word sections. Because we
can expect some relatively short passages by each
writer interspersed with passages by the other, it
seems reasonable to test the entire novel divided
into sections of 524 words (the novel divides almost
exactly into sections of this size). In order to identify
changes of authorship in such brief passages, the
novel is tested with rolling segments of 524 words. The
first section comprises the first 524 words; the next
section comprises the 524 words that begin at word
number 132, the next the 524 words that begin at word
number 263, the next the 524 words that begin at word
number 394, and so on through the rest of the novel.
Rolling segments have been put to good use in several
authorship attribution and stylistics studies; see Craig
(1999), Burrows (2010), and van Dalen-Oskam and
van Zundert (2007).
I am testing the rolling sections of the novel in three
ways. The first uses a list of 2873 marker words that
t-tests identify as being used significantly differently
by the two authors (p < .05). The percentage of the
word types (really individual spellings) in each section
that belong to each author’s set of marker words
is graphed in Fig. 1. The upper set of lines show
the percentages of Kingsley marker words and the
lower set the percentages of Malet marker words. For
example, in the first sections of Chapter 1, about 33%
of the types are Kingsley marker words and about 18%
are Malet marker words. The separation of the two sets
is nicely distinct for the first three chapters, all of which,
as expected, are attributed to Kingsley. The beginning
of Chapter 4 seems to contain some of Malet’s writing,
and about the first two-thirds of Chapter 6 is attributed
to Malet.

150

The t-test results for chapters 4-6 are repeated in
a slightly different form in Fig. 2 (upper two lines;
20% has been added to the percentages for the ttest marker words to create a separation between
the two sets of lines), along with results from Craig
Zeta tests on the same sections (lower two lines).
Rather than showing a separate line for each starting
point, as in Fig.1, all the testing points for each set of
marker words in Fig. 2 are joined by a single line. The
graph for Craig Zeta shows the percentage of types in
each section that are among the 500 most distinctively
used Kingsley and Malet marker words. The smaller
percentages for Zeta than for the t-tests reflect the fact
that only 1000 marker words are used here, compared
to the 2873 ttested marker words. Nevertheless, it is
easy to see that Craig Zeta and t-tests give similar
results and agree generally on the attribution of various
parts of the chapters. Delta tests on similar-sized
sections usually agree with these results as well. Many

Many of the chapters of the novel seem to be largely
by one or the other author, but others seem thoroughly
mixed. These results fall in line with what Malet’s
preface leads us to expect, and overall they seem
fairly persuasive. A recent discovery makes them
both more compelling and somewhat frustrating. After
I had completed the testing described above, the
problem seemed fascinating enough to deserve further
research, and I began by trying to find out whether

Digital Humanities 2011

Kinglsey’s manuscript might still exist. Although I was
not able to find any record of the manuscript, I came
across a record of a copy of the novel in the Princeton
Rare Books collection with Malet’s penciled notes
about which parts of the novel were written by Kingsley
and which she wrote herself. For some chapters, her
notes are quite precise, and they indicate that the
attributions in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are essentially correct.
For other chapters, she notes only that they are “mostly
my father.” Most frustrating of all is the fact that all
markings cease after chapter 28 (of 41). The fact that
the tests described above disagree with her notes for
only 5-7 chapters suggest that, even texts involving
mixed, joint, or collaborative authorship can be usefully
investigated using these methods.

Modes of Composition in Three
Authors
Hoover, David L.

david.hoover@nyu.edu
New York University

a distinction between handwritten and dictated parts,
but the presence of the largely handwritten installments
12 and 13 among the dictated parts suggests that
narrative structure is a more potent force than mode
of composition. Further work will be necessary to
test other characteristics of the text, but the analysis
shown in Fig. 1, along with many others based on
shorter sections, does not suggest that Hardy's mode
of composition radically affected his style.

I have already argued against the widely held
belief that Henry James's switch from handwriting to
dictation caused a radical change in his style (Hoover
2009). However, the wider question of how mode
of composition affects literary style remains open,
and James might be the exception rather than the
rule. I report here on some preliminary studies for
a more comprehensive examination of writers who
changed their mode of composition either temporarily
or permanently. The three authors examined here,
Thomas Hardy, Joseph Conrad, and Walter Scott,
present clear cases of changes from handwriting to
dictation (and back), ones in which the details of
composition are well known, and in which the changes
in mode of composition take place within a single text.
The case of Thomas Hardy is slightly problematic
because he was not always truthful about his wife's
role in the production of his books, and in some
cases burned some MS pages in her hand. For A
Laodicean, one of his less important novels, however,
the facts seem fairly clear. After sending the first
three (of thirteen) installments of the serial version to
the printer, Hardy fell ill, suffering from some kind of
bladder inflamation. He struggled through the fourth
installment, but his doctor then gave him the choice of
lying with his feet higher than his head or an operation.
Choosing the former required him to dictate much
of the novel, though he was able to correct proofs.
He eventually became “less and less dependent on
dictation, writing the final sections of the manuscript in
his own hand.” He mentions writing parts of installment
twelve in a letter (Milgate 2006: 204), and this suggests
he also wrote part thirteen.
To test for any dramatic effect of the switch to dictation,
I divided the novel into four parts, the handwritten
installmens1-4, the dictated 5-11, and the partially or
wholly handwritten 12 and 13, and further divided
these installments into sections of about 9,000 words.
As can be seen in Fig. 1, the sections of the novel
strongly tend to group together chronologically, though
the beginning, 1-4 HW (1), is somewhat unusual, as
often happens with the beginnings of novels, and 5-11
D (5) is also an outlier. At first, Fig. 1 seems to support
152

Fig. 1–Handwriting and Dictation in A Laodicean

Joseph Conrad presents a more complex problem.
Several of his texts were partly dictated, including three
I will examine here, the novellas The End of the Tether
and The Shadow-Line, and novel The Rescue. Conrad
dictated the second serial installment of “The End of
the Tether” to Ford Maddox Ford under time pressure
after part of the manuscript was accidentally burnt. I
have separated the beginning and the burnt installment
from the rest of the story, and have analyzed the parts
in sections of about 2,600 words. As Fig. 2 shows,
the first two sections of the dictated (burnt) installment

Digital Humanities 2011

cluster with the handwritten beginning of the story,
while the last section clusters with the handwritten rest
of the story. The narrative structure is again quite clear
here, but there is nothing to suggest that dictation
altered Conrad's style.

immediately follow it. Again, narrative structure trumps
any effect of the change in mode of composition.

Fig. 3–Handwriting and Dictation in The Shadow-Line

Fig. 2–Handwriting and Dictation in “The End of the Tether”

About one-fourth of The Shadow Line, beginning a little
more than half-way through the novella, were dictated.
Conrad himself ponders the possible effect of mode
of composition, suggesting that “it will be curious for
critics to compare my dictated to my written manner of
expressing myself” (Conrad 1983: 543) . As with The
End of the Tether, however, there is little evidence of
any affect of dictation on the style of the novel, as Fig. 3
shows. Analyses based on different numbers of words
vary somewhat, but the separate cluster containing
the first four sections of the novel is very stable, and
all analyses group the fifth handwritten section of the
beginning of the novel with the dictated sections that

The composition of The Rescue is unusual in that
Conrad first worked on this novel from 1896 to 1898,
but did not finish it until 1918-1919. The early part
was handwritten, while the end was dictated. Although
Conrad suggests that the novel might prove interesting
as a case of style evolution, readers have found the
style “homogeneous” (Karl 1979: 816). Here I divided
the novel into dictated and handwritten parts, and cut
them into sections of about 5,000 words for analysis.
As Fig. 4 shows, the first two dictated parts cluster
with the handwritten parts, and the 7th handwritten
section clusters with the dictated parts. This pattern
is extremely stable in analyses based on the 990-600
MFW, and all analyses show a mixing of sections
produced by the two modes. Further tests based on
other textual features will be needed to make the
case more strongly, but, for Conrad, as for James and
Hardy, the mode of composition has no obvious effect
on style.
153

Digital Humanities 2011

sections 13-17 cluster with the handwritten beginning
of the novel and the other three sections for which no
MS exists. This peculiar pattern needs further study,
but it does not support a difference between Scott's
dictated and handwritten styles.

Fig. 4–Handwriting and Dictation in The Rescue

Turning to Walter Scott, we find a different scenario.
About a third of the way through his career, Scott
was writing very rapidly in an attempt to pay off
an enormous debt. While writing The Bride of
Lammermoor in 1818-19, he suffered from increasingly
severe stomach pains (probably from gall-stone
disease) that prevented him from writing, and finished
the novel by dictation, though it is not entirely clear
exactly where the dictation begins. The final extant MS
leaf corresponds to Chapter 26 (of 33), but it ends
with a catch word and has corrections for later leaves
on the reverse (Milgate 1987: 170). We can be sure,
however, that much, and probably most, of the last
seven chapters were dictated. I have divided the novel
into the part corresponding to the MS and the rest, and
have divided both parts into sections of about 5,000
words. The important peculiarities of the pattern shown
in Fig. 5 remain constant over many analyses. The
first part of the novel for which no MS exists clusters
(loosely) with the final two chapters of MS (though also
with handwritten sections 6-12), but the handwritten
154

Fig. 5–Dictation and Handwriting in The Bride of Lammermoor

Because of continuing stomach pain, Scott also
dictated about half of Ivanhoe, but finished the novel
by hand after he began to recover. I have divided the
novel into handwritten and dictated sections of about
9,000 words. The analysis in Fig. 6 shows that here,
as before, there is no evidence of a significant shift
in style when Scott's mode of composition changed.
The last dictated section clusters with the following
MS sections, while the next to last MS section, MS
(9), clusters with the dictated sections. When fewer
words are analyzed MS (9) shifts to the MS cluster,
but Dict. (9) then also moves into the MS cluster. The
most reasonable interpretation of this behavior is that
the last dictated sections are similar to the adjacent

Digital Humanities 2011

MS sections, and that the important factor is again
narrative structure rather than mode of composition.

Notes
1. The tempting conclusion that the authors' revisions may have
erased any effects of the changes in mode of composition has
some support from the heavy revisions of James and Conrad, but
Hardy was apparently not a heavy reviser, and Scott famously
revised very little.

Fig. 6–Handwriting and Dictation in Ivanhoe

More analysis of other cases, especially those
involving typewriting and word-processing, where
some evidence for significant effects exists from
composition studies, will be needed before any strong
generalizations are possible. Yet the evidence from
James and the three authors examined here strongly
suggests that mode of composition has remarkably
little effect on authorial style.1

Googling Ancient Places

2. manually and automatically generating maps of the
network connections between places.

Isaksen, Leif

The project made use of Greek and English versions
of the text from the Perseus Digital Library <http://
www.perseus.tufts.edu/> which are marked up with
the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) XML schema,
including geographical locations based on automated
string-matching with the Perseus internal gazetteer
and Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names. Closer
analysis revealed that many of the locations were
misidentifications, however, and a relatively laborintensive process was required to correct them.

1. Overview
Our presentation about the Google Ancient Places
(GAP) project will demonstrate new techniques to
computationally identify places referenced in scholarly
texts. We will also discuss deployment of simple Web
services that use resulting place identifications to
help bridge across online literary and material culture
collections.

2. Project History
Funded through the Google Digital Humanities
Award
program
(July
2010-June
2011),
GAP
<http://googleancientplaces.wordpress.com/>
mines
a
portion
of
the
Google
Books
Corpus <http://books.google.com/intl/en/googlebooks/
history.html> to find books related to ancient locations
identified by gazetteers of the Classical Mediterranean
world.
GAP builds upon the Herodotus Encoded SpaceTime Imaging Archive (HESTIA) project. HESTIA
<http://www.open.ac.uk/arts/Hestia/> was a twoyear collaboration (2008-2010) between The Open
University and the Universities of Oxford and
Birmingham, funded by the UK Arts and Humanities
Research Council. Its aim was to explore new methods
for visualizing relationships in Herodotus’ Histories.
The project explored multiple approaches, including:
1. mapping the frequency of references to specific
locations (both spatially and in terms of linear
narrative)

156

HESTIA’s use of Perseus Digital Library resources
demonstrates the growing power of open infrastructure
already established in Classical studies. HESTIA also
helped to demonstrate the utility of visualizing locations
within a narrative. However, could the approach be
automated so as to scale beyond manually processing
individual texts? GAP attempts to answer this
question through more sophisticated computational
methods and by using additional open infrastructure,
especially new Semantic gazetteers (see below) such
as GeoNames <http://www.geonames.org/>, and the
Pleiades Project <http://pleaides.stoa.org/>.
HESTIA’s focus lies in a seminal text, the Histories
by Herodotus. While primary and secondary literary
sources represent key resources for Classical Studies,
Classics also draws upon diverse sources of material
evidence gathered from art history, architecture
and archaeology (Mahony and Bodard 2010:3-5).
These different sources of evidence and their
associated scholarship are often highly “siloed”.
Reference to Perseus or Pleiades resources can
improve their interoperability. To address this issue,
GAP demonstrates how open digital humanities
infrastructure together with the Google Books
Corpus, can be used synergistically to bridge
online literary and material culture collections. GAP
uses Open Context <http://opencontext.org/> to test
such services. Open Context is an open-access
archaeological data publication system offering wideranging documentation of architecture, archaeological
contexts, and objects from multiple contributors (Kansa
and Kansa 2007). Open Context provides a map and
timeline on its splash page to enable both providers
and users to quickly identify related research. The
ability to identify relevant scholarly literature relating to
Open Context’s material culture collections would be a
ground-breaking extension to this service.

Digital Humanities 2011

3. Approach
Prior experience with Herodotus’ Histories informs
GAP’s methodology. In developing the HESTIA
Narrative Timeline, we learned that places referenced
in narrative texts generally cluster together to maintain
narrative coherency. Given a set of toponyms
with multiple possible identifications, the set of
identifications with the shortest overall path between
them is likely to be correct. In addition, we can
add weight to the importance of each toponym
by the number of possible locations it could refer
to. Somewhat counter-intuitively, this means that
small, obscure places with unusual names are much
better guides to location than well-known places
with many namesakes. While a useful starting point,
several additional factors complicate accurate place
identification:
1. The approach does not work well for fragments or
with arbitrary higher-level structures such as the
alphabetic organization of an encyclopedia.
2. The author may assume that the anticipated
audience will be able to contextualize by other
narrative elements (such as well-known individuals)
and thus mention only a single location (or even
none at all).
3. The author may contextualize by giving a territory in
which the place is located. These can confuse pointbased algorithms as there is no single ‘best’ point
that represents them.
4. The author may have confused the place they
are discussing with another, especially if they
are commenting on another work or reporting
independent sources.
5. Occasionally the pattern location clustering
assumption simply does not hold. This is especially
the case for places that do not perform an active
function in the text such as personal names
derived from places of origin (e.g. ‘Herodotus of
Halicarnassus’).
Fortunately, new open infrastructure, especially
Semantic Gazetteers such as GeoNames and
Pleiades, can improve the precision of place
identification. Both GeoNames and Pleiades offer
open, machine-readable data curated by dedicated
communities. They provide unique HTTP URIs for
each place to which multiple names (toponyms),
locations (such as spatial coordinates) and categories
(like ‘settlement’ or ‘region’) can be assigned. These
gazetteers make it much easier to handle the
problem of synonymy and allow us to assign non-

ambiguous and easily resolved public identifiers to
places identified in the Google Books Corpus.
Nevertheless, even with the aid of gazetteers, the
difficulties outlined above make place identifications
highly probabilistic and uncertain, especially in
cases where we find either insufficient or conflicting
evidence. Hard cases can then be handled by a
variety of methods, including more sophisticated but
computationally expensive procedures or by manual
effort of a scholar. Computationally, there are multiple
levels at which we can look for clustering, including
the chapter, book, and corpus (of the author or
even genre). Looking at higher levels may provide
us with broader contextual clues. A further advantage
of working with massive digital corpora is that they
frequently provide multiple translations and editions.
In such cases we can use the linear chain of places
in one edition to inform the processing of another
and vice versa. Finally, as we process more books
the system can record additional metadata about the
places as well as the books. In particular it may see
that in cases of homonymy, one location is much more
frequently mentioned than all the others (such as the
Egyptian Alexandria, as opposed to the many other
cities of that name). This can help in cases where we
have no other contextual clues to draw on. Google
Books metadata and comparison of multiple editions
found Google Books corpus may thus help resolve
ambiguous place determinations in some cases.
It is also important to remember that there are
some hard limits imposed on the process and some
pragmatic aspects to our goals. First, we are only able
to identify those places for which we have an entry
in a gazetteer. Natural Language Processing available
to us will not identify places previously unknown.
Secondly, we are not looking for a ‘perfect’ set of
results for the simple reason that natural language
is ultimately indeterminate. Continued improvement of
computational methods, as well as more traditional
forms of scholarship will be required.

4. Outcomes
Scaling and adapting text processing methods
developed for HESTIA for the larger Google Books
Corpus represents one of the key challenges for GAP.
To help evaluate the effectiveness of our approach,
we first reconciled local identifiers used by the HESTIA
project with Pleiades URIs. We will report on how our
algorithmic approach to place identifications compares
with places manually identified in HESTIA using the
same raw text of the Histories as used by HESTIA. We
will then report on results of our algorithmic method

157

Digital Humanities 2011

on the 1828 translation of the Histories provided by
Google. Finally we will discuss application of our
algorithms for general use on the Google Books
corpus, focusing on public domain texts with Library
of Congress Headings DE-DG (Greco-Roman World;
Greece; Italy).

GAP provides processing results in RDF-expressed
annotations for each text. Such annotations are
extremely useful to software but generally less helpful
for humanities researchers who typically require a
human interface. Thus, GAP also provides Web
mapping tools, like those on the HESTIA and Open
Context websites. These interfaces enable searches
in both directions – from text to places, and from a
place to the texts which reference it. To lower adoption
barriers, we chose RESTful Web service (based on
the Atom Syndication Format and GeoJSON) design
patterns (see Blanke et al. 2009; Kansa and Bissell
2010). Such services enable other developers and

As discussed above, the GAP project makes extensive
use of existing digital humanities infrastructure,
especially place gazetteers such as Pleiades. In doing
so, GAP helps to demonstrate the growing maturity
of digital scholarship in Classical studies. Rather than
standing alone as isolated, one-off efforts, digital
projects increasingly complement one-another and
enable future work. In this light, we hope GAP will
catalyze continued research (see Rosenzweig 2007)
in the text processing methods, systems design, and
semantic standards required to bridge gaps across
literary and material culture collections.

Detecting and Characterizing
National Style in the 19th
Century Novel
Jockers, Matthew

mjockers@stanford.edu
Stanford University

In Representative Irish Tales, Yeats identified two
basic categories of Irish fiction characterized by
what he called “two different accents, the accent
of the gentry and the less polished accent of the
peasantry” (Yeats 1979). Writing of this distinction,
John Cronin notes in The Anglo-Irish Novel how
“Maria Edgeworth and William Carleton fit obviously
enough the two extremes Yeats has defined but a
middle-class figure like Gerald Griffin belongs a little
uneasily somewhere in between” (Cronin 1980). Other
critics including Thomas MacDonagh (MacDonagh
1916), Thomas Flannagan (Flanagan 1959), and most
recently Charles Fanning (Fanning 2000) have all
focused attention on the specific use of language in
Irish narrative and the extent to which linguistic style
and choice of theme and form reflects, or does not, the
unique position of these Irish and Anglo-Irish writers in
a country where the use of English was to evolve in a
rather dramatic fashion.
Though Mark Hawthorne has written that the
“Irish were not accustomed to the English
language and were unaware of its subtleties and
detonations” (Hawthorne 1975), Charles Fanning has
argued that the Irish in fact became masters of the
English language and employed a mode of “linguistic
subversion” that allowed them to comment upon and
even satirize the British who all the while seem to miss
the point that the joke is on them (Fanning 2000).
Cronin argues along similar lines to Fanning when he
writes that the. . . idiomatic unease in their novels is
not caused by any lack of ability on their part in the
writing of a standard English idiom. It derives, rather,
from the tangled situation in which they find themselves
as novelists, directing their efforts towards an Englishspeaking public but trying to give that public a creative
insight into a linguistically piebald area . . . they turned
their very difficulties in regard to idiom to constructive
account by confronting head-on the blending of the
two idioms and two cultures. . . they turn this linguistic
ragout to splendid account, making use in the process
of English, Irish, and Anglo-Irish” (Cronin 1980).

The subject of this research paper, then, is the matter
of exactly how 19th century Irish novelists uniquely
employ style, setting, and theme. The critics seem to
agree that something specific is going on in terms
of language, form, and setting, and yet none gets to
the heart of the matter, to the details of the prose
and to the specific uses of language. Leveraging the
tools and techniques from the authorship attribution
and computational text analysis literature—specifically
natural language processing, machine learning, and
topic modeling—this paper compares and contrasts
both linguistic style and narrative theme in a corpus of
over 500 British and Irish novels from the 19th century.
The results of this work show the precise extent to
which Irish prose is stylistically different from English
prose, and I identify and explore those linguistic and
thematic features that mark the Irish novel as distinctly
different from the British.
Specifically, my research examines style through an
analysis of sentence and word level features. The
results show, among other things, that Irish writers
tend toward expressions that are both longer and
more indeterminate than their British counterparts.
Favoring the long sentence and greater use of the
comma, the Irish write in comparatively complex,
flowing sentences that favor (as measured by relative
frequency) words denoting indeterminacy, words such
as “most,” “some,” “may,” and “yet.” British writers,
on the other hand, show a preference for shorter,
more determinate sentences featuring words such
as “know, never, no, nothing, must, not, only, all,
should, last, first, and great.” This result tends to
confirm anecdotal observations made by scholars,
including (Cronin 1980) who suggest that though the
Irish may have sought to imitate and appeal to the
stylistic preferences of a British dominated industry,
they ultimately invented their own style of prose, which
captured both the rhythms of the local language and
the anxieties of a country struggling with its position
vis-à-vis the colonizing presence of the British.
In addition to probing and comparing the stylistic habits
of the two nations, this work further analyzes the prose
at the level of theme and argues that there is an
important link to be made between style and theme
in Irish prose. To harvest latent themes, I employed
the unsupervised topic modeling tools of the UMASS
machine learning toolkit (McCallum 2002). A run of the
model, which sought to identify the 25 most prominent
topics in the corpus, resulted in one particular topic
appearing with greater frequency in the Irish novels of
the corpus. This topic, which was labeled as “the big
house theme,” is composed of words clearly relating
to tenant-landlord relations and the familial issues
159

Digital Humanities 2011

that are so often explored by Irish writers attempting
to characterize these troubled relationships. The big
house theme was found to be the most prominent topic
in 35% of the Irish novels analyzed in this corpus, and
it is present to a lesser degree in many of the others.

Reassessment.. Salzburg: Institut für Englische
Sprache und Literatur, Universität Salzburg.

My analysis concludes by tracing the links between
distinctly Irish themes and the elements of Irish style
identified in the first part of the research. From the
macroanalytic data derived at the corpus level, I
present a chronological charting of Fanning’s notion
of linguistic subversion, and then I move to the micro
level and offer a closer reading of several exemplary
passages from works in the chronology. I discuss how
linguistic subversion is inherent to the tradition of the
"Irish Bull” and offer a brief discussion of Richard and
Maria Edgeworth’s 1835 essay on the subject in which
they write with some humor that: “English is not the
mother tongue of the natives of Ireland; to them it is
a foreign language, and consequently, it is scarcely
within the limits of probability, that they should avoid
making blunders both in speaking and writing . . .
Indeed, so perfectly persuaded are Englishmen of
the truth of this proposition, that the moment an
unfortunate Hibernian opens his lips they expect a bull,
and listen with that well known look of sober contempt
and smug self satisfaction, which sufficiently testifies
their sense of safety and superiority.” (Edgeworth
1835)

Andrew Kachites McCallum (2002). "Mallet: A Machine
Learning for Language Toolkit.". http://mallet.cs.
umass.edu.

As early as Castle Rackrent (1800), Edgeworth
had demonstrated her own command of linguistic
subversion and an acute awareness of how to form
her narrative and bend language to provide not
simply a distinctly Irish novel but a seminal novel
within the larger novelistic tradition. My work provides
quantitative evidence of how, where, and why Irish
style is different from British.

Geo-Temporal Argumentation:
The Roman Funeral Oration
Johanson, Christopher
cjohanson@gmail.com
UCLA Classics

1. Overview of the Discipline-Specific Project
The Roman aristocratic funeral of the Republic was an
incredible show. It packaged the Roman spectacular
trifecta, the procession, the eulogy and the subsequent
games, which comprised gladiatorial and dramatic
performances. While each of these components of
the funeral has received individual treatment—in the
case of the gladiatorial games, extensive—no detailed,
comprehensive discussion of the aristocratic funeral
of the Republic exists. Moreover, before gladiatorial
games were held in the Colosseum and before
dramatic performances were staged in a monumental
theater, they were first held in ad hoc venues in
the heart of Rome. No attempt has been made
to situate the phenomenon within its surrounding
context, the Roman Forum. My current digital/analog
manuscript project, Spectacle in the Forum: the Roman
Aristocratic Funeral of the Middle Republic, offers
the first attempt to study the mid-Republican funeral
in its totality and, in so doing, examines the most
significant aspects of spectacular stagecraft of the
Roman Republic.

2. The Intellectual Problem
Spectacle has received considerable attention in
recent years, but its study has been marred by
deficiencies in method. Classics scholar Richard
Beacham pinpoints the problem: “Spectacle is threedimensional and sequential, realized by taking place
over a period of time, and its place, circumstance, and
unfolding fundamentally shape what an audience both
expects and experiences.”  Ritual parades, political
speeches, and religious rites are well described in
ancient texts and frequently depicted in art.  Yet,
most spatial and spectacular analyses attempt to
reconstruct the monuments, imagery, actors and
audience, which are inherently kinetic and multidimensional (changing over space and time), by
means of textual description and two-dimensional
plans.

The impact of monumental structures on Roman
performers and their audiences, what could and could
not be seen during their performance, as well as
the significance of monumenta memoriae, directly
affected the shows when first performed, and the
reading and interpretation of the records subsequently
examined by scholars.  Performance “stages” of the
mid-Republic were ephemeral: extant temple podia,
elevated balconies, and hillsides, might serve as
caveae. Simple temporary structures may have been
all that was needed to mount a production.
Three-dimensional digital models offer a partial
solution. There are now a growing number of projects
that have used computerized reconstructions to
visualize Imperial Rome. There have been very few
similar attempts to represent the Republican city,
and hardly any that make scholarly arguments set
within the digital reconstructions. Most reconstruction
projects tend to focus on the creation of a
highly accurate, extraordinarily precise digital model
informed by scholarship as the ultimate goal. Instead,
this project uses hypothetical reconstructions as a
digital laboratory. By injecting historical context—
the performers and the audience—into the digital
environment, the digital investigation transforms the
quantifiable elements of the ephemeral experience of
ancient spectacle into a digital object fit for experiential
analysis. It uses the hypothetical reconstructions as
a digital laboratory to explore the staging of Roman
spectacle and develop the digital toolset necessary for
scholarly interrogation and publication of spatial and
experiential arguments.

3. Geo-Temporal Argumentation: the Roman
Funeral Oration
The laudatio funebris of the mid-Republic was genredefying visual theater. While it is now generally agreed
that the persuasive techniques of oratory comprised
verbal (the content and delivery of the speech) and
visual elements (gestures charged with meaning and
explicit visual and topographic references), the degree
to which the choreography of the funeral eulogy
subordinated the words of the speech has not been
fully examined. For much of the audience, the visuality
of the event eclipsed the aural content. The laudatio,
like the pompa before it, relied on a basic set of
quasi-formulaic visual cues to communicate with the
audience, or at least, to communicate some ideas
to some of the audience. To call the laudatio a
speech alone, and to classify it within the realm
of oratory without qualification is to misunderstand
much of the purpose and the choreography of the
event. In this presentation, I will put the event in
161

Digital Humanities 2011

its proper place: the Forum. Through the use of
textual analysis, experiential investigation, and geotemporal argumentation, I will demonstrate that the
laudatio funebris was a multivariate theatrical event,
comprising two discrete elements targeted at two
distinct audiences.

of the data and publication of this new form of scholarly
inquiry. We anticipate a mid-winter release of the
working 3D system.

Though one can use a laboratory built out of virtual
world infrastructure to experiment, a researcher cannot
(yet) “publish” the entirety of a laboratory experience
and call it scholarly communication. Rather, the
laboratory is the space where the research occurs;
the results must be woven together into a narrative in
order to engage with the larger scholarly conversation.
Nonetheless, a text and image narrative is insufficient
to convey the totality of the kinetic and temporal
subject matter. Geo-temporal argumentation presents
an innovative and more robust method of idea
dissemination by offering:

3. A refutable system embedded in a geographic

4. Narrative, perhaps rhizomatic, that enables nonlinear review and exploration
When the experience and creation of kinetic transitions
are fundamental to an understanding of an argument
the reader must, quite simply, walk in the footsteps
of the authors in order to participate in the debate,
critique the result, and modify the conclusions. In
this paper I aim to demonstrate that, for space- and
time-centric, phenomenological investigations, geotemporal argumentation is a new and superior form of
scholarly communication.

4. The Technology and the Collaborative Project
As is always the case, digital humanities projects
are collaborative endeavors. My “manuscript” project
provides the domain-specific area of inquiry, but the
digital platforms that facilitate the research are part of
two, larger collaborative efforts of which I am but one
of a number of co-investigators.
GeoTemporal Publication Platform: The research
results and assessment will be published within
HyperCities, a geo-temporal content aggregation and

development of 3D narrative and mark-up tools within
the HyperCities platform that will facilitate exploration

The Object of Platform Studies:
Relational Materialities and the
Social Platform (the case of the
Nintendo Wii)

Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System,
by Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort, inaugurated the
Platform Studies series at MIT Press in 2009.
We’ve coauthored a new book in the series
(currently under contract and final review, MIT Press),
Codename: Revolution: the Nintendo Wii Video Game
Console. Platform studies is a quintessentially DigitalHumanities approach, since it’s explicitly focused
on the interrelationship of computing and cultural
expression. According to the series preface, the
goal of platform studies is “to consider the lowest
level of computing systems and to understand
how these systems relate to culture and creativity.”
In practice, this involves paying close attention
to specific hardware and software interactions-to the vertical relationships between a platform’s
multilayered materialities (Hayles; Kirschenbaum),
from transistors to code to cultural reception. Any
given act of platform-studies analysis may focus for
example on the relationship between the chipset
and the OS, or between the graphics processor and
display parameters or game developers’ designs.
In computing terms, platform is an abstraction
(Bogost and Montfort), a pragmatic frame placed
around whatever hardware-and-software configuration
is required in order to build or run certain specific
applications (including creative works). The object of
platform studies is thus a shifting series of possibility
spaces, any number of dynamic thresholds between
discrete levels of a system. As with the “text” in recent
textual studies (McKenzie; McGann), the “platform”
in platform studies is actually observed in action, as
one or more transactional events, defined in the act
of observation or performance. In this sense, platform
studies examines the ways in which material conditions

of computing systems determine (by constraining and
affording) the experience of creative or expressive
works.
Although there are now competing systems coming
on to the market from Microsoft (Kinect) and Sony
(Move), Nintendo’s Wii (2006) was the first major
video game console to be based on motion control, to
make use of what Jesper Juul has called a mimetic
interface to capture player movements in physical
space and represent those movements in the game
world. This paper will explain and demonstrate in
precise terms how that’s made possible through the
use of a relatively off-the-shelf multichannel system
of infrared (IR) and Bluetooth communications, along
with data collected dynamically by the Analog Devices
ADXL330 triple-axis accelerometer, a MEMS (Micro
Electronic Mechanical Systems) device, a chip inside
the wand-like Wii Remote--a tiny machine, with moving
parts that measures motion along X, Y, and Z axes
in relation to gravity. In this paper we’ll show how this
piece of hardware with accompanying code is used
to design new software for the Wii, and we’ll illustrate
some of the specific constraints and affordances of
the accelerometer by tracing the particular case study
of third-party software developer Ubisoft’s SamuraiWestern FPS games, Red Steel I and II. The two
games in this franchise mark points on a brief timeline,
starting with the release of the first realistic action
adventure game in 2006, as an exclusive title for the
original Wii platform, followed by its relative critical
failure, and then, four years later, the subsequent
introduction of a “reboot” sequel, with completely
revamped, cel-shaded, manga-style aesthetics, and
all-new swordplay mechanics. This second game
was timed to coincide with Nintendo’s release of the
controller add-on, Wii MotionPlus, a second MEMS
device that plugs into the base of the Wii Remote and
contains a “tuning-fork” gyroscope (the Invensense
IDG-600), and thus adds more measurable dimensions
to the system, giving the controller pseudo-global
sensitivity and something closer to 1:1 mapping of
player motions with in-game events. (This retrofit
solution has now been superseded with the release of
a new Wii Remote that ships with integrated versions
of the two MEMS devices combined in one controller.)
That timeline, from 2006-2010, clearly marked a
learning curve for Ubisoft’s developers (including
moving to the LyN 3D game engine, designed for
the Wii, to make the second game), and the radical
changes they made over the intervening four years
serve as a vivid example of creative works being
shaped in response to (and anticipation of) the
constraints and affordances of a specific platform. The
163

Digital Humanities 2011

story of the two Red Steels highlights an important
fact--that a video game console is in effect a platform
for production, transmission, publishing, and player
reception, all in one system. In this way, a game
platform--even at the lowest level--is an inherently
social phenomenon, determined by developer as well
as consumer and player expectations. Drawing from
textual studies’ idea of the social text, we’ll argue
that the “social platform” that is the object of platform
studies is “social” in a particular sense: it’s based
on the relational materialities that both constrain and
afford the production, transmission, and reception of
creative works, the whole process that links hardware
and software design to the player and the wider culture.
This paper will illustrate this larger theoretical point
by explaining one chain of concrete materialities on
multiple levels in the case of Red Steel for the Wii--from
tiny MEMS devices to in-game graphics, programming
to marketing, transistors to cultural contexts.

1. Introduction
This paper describes a number of ways in which a
temporally-sensitive electronic dictionary resource, the
Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary
(2 vols; Oxford, 2009 [=HTOED]), may be employed
in the automatic dating of words and entire texts.
We investigate how the text captures time: most
expressly, how the residue of the present (or the
different ‘presents’ of language history) have managed
to become trapped in the linguistic matrix of a narrative
so that we sense, for instance, the difference between
a period being represented and the narrator’s temporal
positionality, or even the gap between an author and
his or her narrative stance. Through computer-assisted
means we analyze the impact of later historical and
linguistic events on the reporting of earlier events. To
this end, we have developed an automatic system
for retrieving dating information and a colour-coded
browsing interface for searching and viewing the timecoded text, calling it the ‘Time Machine’.
Novels capture worlds, but however disparate the
materials that may go into them, something of the
space-time in which they have been written remains as
a residue. This, in part, is a function of language itself:
the instabilities, changes and, above all, affordances
at any one moment of that linguistic mesh that Lotman
(1990) might have called the semiosphere. In part,
too, it is a function of what, within Cultural Imagology,
might more concretely be called the texture of the
iconosphere (Johnson 2005, 2006): the distinctiveness
given to the world at any particular moment by the

Digital Humanities 2011

concatenation of signifying objects present within it.
This is why it is an attractive idea to apply a tool
such as a time-coded dictionary to novels written at
time t purporting to convey events taking place at
a time t-x. Within this frame of thought, the case of
the historical novel is a particularly pronounced one.
By definition, the genre tries to capture something of
the iconosphere of a world that has passed us by
(even though its semiosphere may remain that of a
contemporary reader). And even in cases where the
linguistic texture of the semiosphere is deliberately
archaized – or localized by the use of dialect forms –
the residue of the present remains. As a test case, we
examine Diana Gabaldon’s Cross Stitch (1991): a text
which flaunts traditional temporal typologies by figuring
a protagonist who crosses from the iconosphere of
the mid-twentieth century to that of the seventeenth
century and becomes trapped there: perceiving the
past in a lexis and syntax which palpably belong to a
different age.
Time has previously been explored within documents
in several ways. Some work has concentrated on
identifying expressions of time within text in an attempt
to build models of the succession of events. This has
been particularly fruitful in the case of, for example,
medical discharge records and road accident reports,
where the sequence of events is of great importance
(Hirschman 1981, Kayser and Nouioua 2009). Other
work has used a training set of time-associated words
and a Naïve Bayes Classifier to detect temporal
concepts in blogs (Noro et al. 2006). While this
work is promising in analyzing writings about daily
life in a compact time frame, it seems ill-equipped
for investigating iconospheres that deal with spans
constituting years or even decades. Thus a tool that
can retrieve time-related information from the HTOED
automatically offers a very promising way forward for
the literary and linguistic scholar.

2. Methodology
Using the ‘Time Machine’, we map out the iconospheric
precision with which Gabaldon represents different
characters in her fiction (not to mention the humour
generated by the gradual blending of their discourses
as the novel progresses). But beyond this, by linking
our tool with the powerful additional resources which
the HTOED has now opened up for those studying the
‘external’, ‘mental’ and ‘social’ worlds of the novel from
a historical and etymological perspective, the project
hopes to facilitate the achievement of a more nuanced
understanding of the interrelationship between ‘real’
and ‘fictional’ time in the historical novel than has been
possible before.

In order to better study iconospheres, we sought to
develop a tool that would automatically look up dating
information and definitions for words, processing entire
texts at a time, thereby removing the need for manual
queries using a dictionary. Furthermore, we wanted
the tool, on the one hand, to enable users to specify
time periods of interest for closer inspection while, on
the other hand, it left them free to browse the material
through diverse visualization schemes in order to
discover trends or new time periods of interest.
At present the tool is a prototype, running inside a
web browser, in order to enable rapid experimentation
with new visualization schemes using CSS. We use a
local SQL database to store the HTOED data. Texts
can be uploaded via a browser interface and are
processed in any user-defined units tagged in the text,
e.g. page by page or speaker by speaker, or in the
text as a whole. The tool reads both XML and plain
text. To finish verifying that the visualization schemes
we have chosen are useful, we wish to bring the
tool to the digital humanities community, in addition to
the poetics and linguistics community (Johnson et al.
2010). Following this, we intend to develop the final tool
in Java for inclusion within the LICHEN toolbox.

3. Results
What the HTOED is able to offer to the ‘Time
Machine’ is the ability to isolate different experiential
modes within particular iconospheres at the same
time as it reveals the range of etymological meanings
open to the reader at any given moment. (This, of
course, is an invaluable aid for critics who wish to
avoid anachronism in their own readings.) In our
preliminary development of the ‘Time Machine’ we
concentrated on its capacity for isolating different
lexical categories within a given iconosphere and
indicating the etymological choices available for
particular readings. At the top of the screen, the Source
section allows the user to choose either an entire text or
some part of it (see Figure 1 below: a case in which the
speaker Jamie has been chosen). In the Filter section,
the user can choose to narrow the search down to
one particular word, or to all words that were in use
at a particular time (choosing either first use date,
last use date or both). To produce the present screen
we started by choosing all the words that entered the
language after 1742, in other words after the time
period in which Jamie speaks. The Colour-coded text
section then highlighted all those words which entered
the language after the given date, as did our Wordlist
section.

165

Digital Humanities 2011

Our initial investigation found that the tool is able to
pick out swathes of temporal incongruities from this
playful text or, further, search out instances relating
more specifically to the ‘external’, ‘mental’ and ‘social’
worlds of the novel. It spots moments when the
eighteenth-century clansman Jamie seems prescient
(mentioning ‘aesthetics’ for instance, or re-circulating
the word ‘sadist’, which has been bandied to him by his
twentieth-century wife). It detects instabilities not only
in the iconosphere of the 1700s – which Gabaldon has
carefully researched – but also in the representation of
mid-twentieth-century England (which she appears to
have taken more for granted).
However, despite the manifest advantage of using
even this approach to the ‘Time Machine’ to spot
faultlines and incongruities within the fictional world
of a novel, some teething-troubles remained: the
most significant being that, unlike human readers, the
prototype cannot, of course, intuit the ‘correct’ lexical
choice from the range of possible meanings thrown up
by a search. Accordingly, we have tweaked the search
and display capability of the ‘Time Machine’ so that it
can also narrow its lexical catchment area by trawling
parts of speech (such as substantives) in which
cultural and temporal change exhibit their highest
visibility. Figure 1 demonstrates how, using these
restrictions, the prototype is able to flag up the way
in which Gabaldon has inadvertently endowed Jamie’s
lexicon with three words stereotypically associated
with Scottishness (‘Sassenach, shinty, sporran’) which
were not, in fact, recorded until some time after the
period in which Jamie is meant to be speaking.
In sum, our study indicates that automated access to
chronological information, such as the date of first use
for any given word, and full etymologies has promising
applications in literary and historical research that
has until now relied mostly on intuition and laborious
manual methods to combine dating information and
texts. And beyond this, with some adaptation, it is also
clear that the ‘Time Machine’ could be of significance
within areas such as forensic linguistics, collocation
studies, and the study of micro-linguistic change over
time in large corpora.

2. Trends 21 Project

2.1. Aims and Background
Trends 21 is the name of a project within the
government-led humanities promotion program.1 The
Research Institute of Korean Studies at Korea
University has developed the Trends 21 corpus, a
collection of four major Korean daily and national
newspapers issued from the year 2000. The goal
of the Trends 21 project can be summarized with
the following three points: first, to construct language
resources of newspaper articles as a large general
purpose database; second, to identify linguistic/
social/cultural characteristics and to analyze their
changes in Korea; finally, to measure and to estimate
any linguistic/social/cultural trends from patterns of
language use. One of the outcomes from this project
is the Trends 21 corpus. It is a collection of Korean
newspaper texts covering most of the topics in print. In
the next section, we present how the Trends 21 corpus
has been built.

2.2. Designing and Compiling the Corpus

ilhwan52@gmail.com
Research Institute of Korean Studies, Korea
University

In order to achieve the project goals, articles were
culled from a number of newspaper companies. We
collected newspaper articles from four major daily
national newspapers issued in Korea for one decade,
between 2000 and 2009.2 The candidate dailies are
Chosun, Dong-a, Joongang, and Hankyoreh.

1. Introduction

These daily newspaper companies have provided us
with all the contents printed for ten years. In electronic
form, the majority of newspaper services are provided
in various Standard Generalized Markup Language
(SGML) format, which is hard for us to unify the
format by using NewsML. Due to this situation, we
developed a ‘Trends 21 Markup Language (T21ML)’ in
order to construct our raw corpus. With the availability
of machine-readable texts, especially the collection
of a large quantity of articles, it was possible to
build a large-scale raw corpus. However, we did not
upload all the contents from the newspapers into our
corpus. Instead we eliminated irrelevant contents (like
obituaries) in order to balance the contents.

This study aims to introduce how a Korean newspaper
corpus, Trends 21 has been constructed and to explore
how social, cultural, and linguistic characteristics are
portrayed in the Trends 21 corpus. Newspapers
contain enormous quantities of language resources
which mirror social and cultural characteristics as
they undergo gradual as well as sudden changes.
Newspapers are regularly published and contain
stories of events, personalities, crimes, business,
entertainment, society, sports and others. Editorials
discuss current or recent news of either general
interest or a specific topic. Journalists are trained to
write objectively and to show all sides to an issue. In
addition, the sources for the news story are identified
and are reliable. Therefore, we have employed the
newspaper corpus to identify social or culture trends.

For our research purposes we established twelve
classes of content, namely ‘T21 Class’, to classify
the contents of news articles, namely: politics,
international news, economics, society, culture, sports,
science, columns, opinions, special issues, regions,
and people. It excludes lists of names, lists of stocks,
obituaries, advertisements, and weather. Although
167

Digital Humanities 2011

some contents are removed by design, our corpus
contains various contents or topics as a whole.
Saturation (McEnery et al. 2006) at the lexical level can
be tested for representativeness of a corpus.
Once the raw corpus was constructed, we employed
an automatic morphological analyzer and tagger for
Korean, KMAT (Lee & Rim 2009), to annotate partsof-speech and morpheme information. We applied
two-stage tagging processes to our raw corpus,
in which an available annotated corpus consisting
of 15 million words is corrected by humans and
then is employed as a training corpus for the
tagger. Further, human annotators not only corrected
the erroneous analyses produced by the tagging
system, but also improved the tagging system by
finding problematic fixed expressions, picking out
homonyms, and classifying unseen types of borrowed
words or proper nouns. During the first three-year
phase of the Trends 21 Project (2008-2010), this
corpus has been fully annotated for parts-of-speech
and morphological information. Figure 1 shows the
processing architecture of building the Trends 21
Corpus.

Figure 1. An overview of the Trends 21corpus building process

As of Oct 2010, the Trends 21 corpus consists of
about 400 million words, and it is by far the greatest
morphologically annotated corpus of Korean. In Table
1, statistical information is provided.3

target words and extract their co-occurring words
appearing nearby. Co-occurrence analysis assumes
that two semantically related terms co-occur in the
same text segments (Sinclair 1991). In contrast to most
previous studies that observe co-occurrences within
the same sentence, we propose as a search window
size a paragraph (Kang 2010). A paragraph of news
article is highly coherent in that its sentences are
related to one another to describe one short story or
an event.
The extraction of co-occurring words is based on
the statistical information about the co-occurrences of
words. The mutual information or z-score has mainly
been used in various studies as a statistical measure;
however, both of the measures give skewed results to
infrequently used words. To reduce this difficulty, we
adopt t-score as a measure of how strongly word pairs
(a target word and co-occurring words) are related
(Kang 2010).
Then the information is represented as a network,
a formal graph based approach. We have employed
Pajek (Nooy, Mrvar & Vladimir 2005) for analysis and
visualization of co-occurrence networks. The network
structure typically consists of nodes connected by
weighted links. Given the current data set, target
words and co-occurrences assign a term or a concept
to each node and the values of the t-scores to
link. This network provides a graphic visualization
of potential relationships between nouns that portray
social/cultural trends with respect to their language use
patterns.
Figure 2 is the co-occurrence network of thirty Korean
emotional nouns, such as: ‘love’, ‘hatred’, ‘hope’,
‘disappointment’, ‘happiness’, ‘unhappiness’ and so
on. In Figure 2, ‘father’ (abeci in Korean) co-occurs with
‘love’, ‘hope’, ‘happiness’, ‘hatred’, and ‘unhappiness’;
on the other hand ‘daddy’ (appa in Korean) only cooccurs with ‘happiness’.

3. Case Study: Co-occurrence Network Analysis
In a case study, we focus on only the nouns that
are included in the Trends 21 corpus. A network
based approach is then introduced that can deal with
visualizing related nouns. According to Stubbs (1996),
frequently occurring patterns allow the observer to
make deductions about what a group or society
sees as valuable or important. Information about
collocation means that new concepts and the range of
associations of a word can be monitored. We select
168

Figure 2. Network of thirty Korean emotional
nouns with their fifty co-occurring words

Digital Humanities 2011

The word ‘hatred’ co-exists with ‘terror’, ‘Islam’,
‘(human) race’, ‘religion’, and ‘media’. We notice that
in the early twenty-first century there were many
international conflicts. If we expand the number of cooccurrences, we may deduce different interpretations
from the articles.

This paper has presented how the Trends 21 corpus
is built and how it is composed. We have proposed
a visualization method to express co-occurrences of
words in an overview network. The network approach
to words in news articles represents contemporary
Korean language use. Moreover, information about cooccurrences helps us understand social/cultural issues
at a point of time.
The construction of the Trends 21 corpus is not
done yet. The same composition schema is going
to be followed year by year in order for the corpus
to be constantly updated. In that sense, the Trends
21 corpus serves us as a monitor corpus (Sinclair
1991). This corpus can also reflect language changes
in constant growth. In the future we would like to
apply cluster analysis as well as keyword analysis.
We further plan to enhance the network analysis by
displaying concept hierarchy. Finally we also plan
to investigate networks according to topics and cooccurrences within an article, not only with in a
paragraph.

Abstract Values in the 19th
Century British Novel: Decline
and Transformation of a
Semantic Field
Le-Khac, Long

1. Introduction
This paper analyzes the historical behavior of
several semantic fields of “abstract values” in a
corpus of 2,779 19th century British novels. The
corpus is a composite archive of canonical and
non-canonical texts drawn from Project Gutenberg,
Internet Archive, and Chadwyck-Healey’s 19th-century
Fiction Collection. In his classic study, Culture and
Society, Raymond Williams claimed that a group
of keywords that arose and/or changed dramatically
in the nineteenth century offered “a special kind
of map [of the] wider changes in life and thought”
of the age (Williams 1958). We develop Williams’s
insight by applying quantitative methods to a much
larger corpus than available at the time of his study.
Using a tool we built specifically for our research,
we were able to aggregate words whose historical
frequencies follow similar trends, thus identifying
particularly dynamic semantic cohorts; from these, we
found dramatic declines and transformations in fields
of social restraint, moral valuation, sentiment, and
partiality over the nineteenth century – and an equally
dramatic increase in the use of concrete description
fields in the same period. We examine the implications
of these findings with respect to broader ideological
and narrative patterns of the British novel.

2. Background
In prior applications of semantic fields to quantitative
literary studies, researchers have tended to measure
the relative presence of certain fields, “themes” or
otherwise-labeled word-groups in individual texts (e.g.
Louwese 2004; Ide 1989; Fortier 1989). We hope
to complement such comparative work by tracing
the diachronic behavior of particular semantic fields
170

across a corpus of nineteenth-century novels. In
addition, we aim to specify our theoretical object
of the semantic field more precisely, both by
developing our fields through an empirical method
of word-cohort correlation, and by grounding them
in their original conceptualization by early twentiethcentury semantics. In “Bedeuntungssysteme,” R. N.
Meyer influentially defined a semantic field as “the
ordering of a definite number of expressions from
a particular point of view”—or in other words, from
a particular “differentiating factor” (Meyer 1910). To
borrow Meyer’s example: the sense of purposefulness,
present in the transitive verb ersteigen (to climb) but
not in the intransitive verb steigen (to rise), could serve
as the “differentiating factor” around which a particular
Bedeuntungssystem derived its identity.
In its period focus and objectives, this project is
indebted to Raymond Williams’s Culture and Society,
which analyzes the historical semantics of a period of
unprecedented change for Britain. He contends that
changes in discourse help reveal broader sociocultural
changes. These wider changes, he argues, are
of no small consequence; indeed, they introduced
many of the social elements and ideas central
to what we now think of as distinctive to our
modern way of life (Williams 1958). Of course,
Williams’s ambitious attempt to analyze an entire social
discourse, astonishing as it is, lacked the tools and
corpora now available to digital humanities scholars.
This paper represents some first steps in pursuing
Williams’s objectives by applying quantitative methods
to a large novelistic corpus in order to explore specific
but dramatic changes in language and culture in this
volatile period.

3. Methods
Our method of field-creation consists of two stages:
discovery and development. First, to discover potential
fields, we developed a technique of word-cohort
correlation. We input “seed” words considered
significant by previous literary historical work and
query the corpus for words whose historical frequencytrends most resemble those of the “seed” words.
When this automatically generated cohort of correlated
words shares a specifiable differentiating factor and
their overall trend is significant, we consider such
a word-cohort the embryo of a dynamic semantic
field ripe for development. We then develop the field
further by employing semantic taxonomies from within
the humanities and linguistics such as the OED's
historical thesaurus to identify the semantic content of
these word cohorts and subdivide them into specific
semantic fields to track. This method, which oscillates

Digital Humanities 2011

between semantic taxonomies and empirical word
frequency correlations, ensures that the semantic
fields we generate satisfy two characteristics: semantic
coherence and coherence of historical behavior.
We consider this dual requirement as a pragmatic
move. The first requirement ensures that our results
are semantically and culturally interpretable. The
second requirement ensures that the aggregate term
frequency results of the semantic fields are actually
representative of the behaviors of their constituent
words.

5. Results

4. The Semantic Fields
In particular, this paper reports on a study of the
historical behavior of four semantic fields of “abstract
values.” We identified these transforming semantic
fields through the methods described above. This
study presents and analyzes the dramatic decline
and transformation of four semantic fields [Fig. 1]
discovered under this method (each is named after
what we considered the differentiating factor of that
field).

Example Words

Values of Social Restraint

Sentiment

Partiality

Fig. 1

Fig. 2

Tracing the diachronic behavior of these fields over the
nineteenth century, we found the four abstract values
fields exhibited strikingly parallel downward trends [For
their individual plots, see Fig. 5-8]. Collectively, the
aggregate term frequency for the fields of abstract
values decreases step-wise through the nineteenth
century [Fig. 2], from ~1% of all words in the period of
1800-1810, to ~0.6% of words (~1 in every 170 words)
by the 1860s, a decrease of about 40%.

6. Discussion
Given the range and scope of our corpus and the
magnitude of this trend, we consider our results
reflective of broad changes in the 19th century British
novel. The data indicates a significant decrease
in the usage of these fields. Without positing a
simple reflective relationship between literary and
sociocultural currents, we nevertheless take seriously
Raymond Williams’s approach to social changes
through changes in discourse. Thus, we consider
the data to suggest the responsiveness of novelistic
language to fundamental shifts in British value systems
and social norms in this turbulent and transformative
period, specifically shifts away from values of restraint,
virtue, objectivity, and sentiment.

171

Digital Humanities 2011

Fig. 3

The historical behavior data of an entirely different set
of words, discovered under the same method, helps
to contextualize and interpret this trend. Instead of
a semantic field tightly organized around a specific
differentiating factor, this highly correlated wordcohort (named “Hard Seed” after its seed word)
comprises a variety of semantic fields and types
of words—colors, body parts, numbers, locational
and directional adjectives and prepositions, action
verbs, and physical adjectives. This word cohort can
be collectively characterized as concrete description
words. In contrast to the values fields, the aggregate
term frequency of this latter group [Fig. 3] increases
steadily across the 19th century from 3.5% of all words
(~1 in every 30 words) to 6.5% of all words (~1 in every
15 words)—an increase in usage of about 85%.

Fig. 4

172

Plotting the term frequencies of the abstract values
field against those of the hard seed field in each of
the novels in our corpus reveals a strongly inverse
relationship between the two [Fig. 4]. Given the
observed tendency for novels with higher frequencies
of hard seed words to have lower frequencies of
abstract values words and vice versa, we produced
two rankings of the novels to see the types of
narrative that correspond to the emphasis of one
field over the other [see Fig. 9 for a ranking of a
subset of the corpus, the Chadwyck-Healey fiction
collection]. Strikingly, ranking novels by these two
features indeed separates out clusters of genres into a
spectrum. The resulting distribution of novels allows us
to interpret these two major correlated historical trends
in novelistic language as deeper shifts in narrative
mode. The spectrum shows an overarching movement
from narratives with small social spaces organized
by highly polarized, evaluative, and uniform fields
of social norms to narratives with far larger social
spaces where the fields of social norms are more
diverse, conflicting, ambiguous, and ultimately, less
constraining. Simultaneously, there is a stylistic move
away from abstract, explicitly evaluative language to
concrete, physical language whose valuation, if any,
is more ambiguous, variable, and indirect. That the
expansion of narrative social space corresponds to this
stylistic shift suggests a systemic tendency in which
the representation of wider, more diverse, and less
constraining social spaces is made possible by a more
physical, concrete language.

7. Conclusion
This study represents initial steps in developing the
quantitative analysis of the historical semantics of
literary discourse in a corpus robust enough to
allow the study of large-scale historical change. The
methods developed herein have proven promising in
identifying and analyzing robust semantic fields whose
dynamics can rigorously be interpreted as reflections
of literary and cultural trends. A wide field of potential
inquiry remains for future studies in this vein.

1. Abstract
Burton Pike described Rainer Marie Rilke’s style
in Rilke’s only prose novel, The Notebooks of
Malte Laurids Brigge, as “… arresting, haunting, and
beautiful, but it is not smooth. His style is explicit,
direct, almost laconic, and it has an edge.” (2008, p.
xvii) Pike argues that this “edge” was not sufficiently
emphasized in previous English language translations
and he thus wrote a new translation. The goal of this
research is to explore the degree to which automated
text analysis tools can capture the different styles used
by Burton Pike and Stephen Mitchell in their respective
translations. We are particularly interested in what
kinds of similarities and differences can be captured
between two renderings of Rilke’s novel and in the
implications of these findings on the reviews, reader
reception, and critical analysis of the original work in
two translations.

2. Method
Two candidate analysis tools were used to identify
similarities and differences between the Pike and
Mitchell translations of Rilke’s novel The Notebooks
of Malte Laurids Brigge. The first approach used
a syntactic representation of the texts which was
generated using the Stanford Lexical parser (http://
nlp.stanford.edu/index.shtml). Before running
the parser, each translation was tokenized into
sentences using the Natural Language Toolkit
tokenizer (http://www.nltk.org/). The generated
lexical dependencies, which capture grammatical
relations between words in a sentence, were then
uploaded to the oracle database for subsequent
analysis.

Digital Humanities 2011

The second approach used a statistical approach–
principal component analysis–to compare the
manifestations of the novel. Our experiment reflects
McKenna et al.’s study (1999) of similarities and
differences between Samuel Beckett’s French and
English translation of Molloy. Three matrixes were
produced comprising the 99 most common words in
each of Pike and Mitchell’s translation and the original
text. The rows of the matrix reflect 8 text blocks
of 7,500 words. Principal component analysis, which
measures the variance of 99 most frequent words in
the 8 blocks, was then applied to each matrix and the
top eigenvectors produced were mapped into a two
dimensional space for visual analysis.

3. Results
Dependency grammar analysis
Table 1 provides the summary statistics of grammatical
relations which showed the largest difference captured
in the parser for each translation. Although the two
translations show a remarkable degree of similarity
in the frequency and type of grammatical relations
they employ, the dependencies revealed several
differences between the two renderings. The main
areas of difference were found in the use of
negation modifiers, prepositional modifiers, object of
preposition, parataxis, and in the word choices for
adjectival and adverbial modifiers.
The dependency grammar results show that Pike used
many more negation modifiers than Mitchell, which is
confirmed by word frequency analysis. Pike uses the
non-contracted verb, which places more emphasis on
negation and thus also stays closer to the original text
whereas Mitchell rarely uses a non-contracted verb
form. The word “not” is not the only word in Pike’s
translation which indicates a negation that is used with
higher frequency. Pike uses “no” with higher frequency
than Mitchell, and also “nothing,” “never,” and “none.”
The frequencies of prepositional modifier and object of
preposition relations in two texts indicate a difference
in how the prepositions are used in the text. This
result shows a higher overall frequency of prepositions
in Mitchell’s translation (Table 1). The sentence level
analysis of two texts, however, revealed that Pike is
more likely to repeat and thus emphasize the same
preposition throughout the sentence whereas Mitchell
is more likely to leave out the preposition rather than
repeat it. This finding suggests that in addition to
the overall difference in the frequency of prepositions
captured through the parser, there are indicators
that the use of prepositions, their placement and

distribution throughout the sentence, show differences
in two texts.
The comparison of two translations revealed a
higher frequency of sentences that use a semicolon
to separate sub-clauses in Mitchell’s translation
(parataxis). Mitchell frequently arranges independent
sentences using semicolons and colons, and in this
way follows closely the original text, while Pike
occasionally intersperses “but” and “and” in place of
semicolons and colons. This finding is supported by
the frequency of conjunction “but” in two translations
which is found at higher frequency in Pike’s translation,
559, than in Mitchell’s, 506. This difference in sentence
structure may provide the “edge” which Pike claims
was missing in previous translations.
An examination of the unique adverbs and adjectives
used in each translation revealed that although Mitchell
and Pike may use similar grammatical relations in
their respective renderings, their word choices are
frequently different. This suggests that a semantic
rather than the syntactic analysis may reveal additional
differences.
PCA analysis
Figure 1 shows the score plots of the translations and
suggests that the distribution of frequent terms is very
similar between the two translations. However, the
grouping of the 7th block with 4th, 5th, and 6th rather
than with 8th block, in Mitchell’s translation, calls for
a closer analysis of the 7th block of the novel and its
comparison with the 7th block in Rilke’s original text
and Pike’s translation. The last part of the novel, which
corresponds to the 8th block of text, is visibly different
in style and tone from the rest of the novel and this
difference is indicated by the location of the 8th block
in the far right corner of the plot in each version.

4. Conclusion
Our results thus far suggest that syntactic grammatical
relations reveal differences between the two
translations that are not captured when using a bagof-word approach (word frequencies of function words
and 1,000 most frequent words). In contrast, the PCA
analysis using matrices of frequent terms in the 8
blocks of text suggests that only small differences exist
between the translations, with the exception of the 7th
block of text, which warrants further investigation.
The similarity captured between translations using
the PCA analysis brings to mind Jan Rybicki’s
article “Burrowing into Translation: Character Idiolects
in Henryk Sienkiewicz’s Trilogy and its Two
English Translations” in which Rybicki analyzes
175

Digital Humanities 2011

the distinctiveness of character idiolects in Henryk
Sienkiewicz’s trilogy and concludes that: “… the
patterns of difference and similarity are almost
mysteriously preserved in the translations—so well
that the above-mentioned linguistic differences might
be the sole reason for the small differences between
the original and the translation. In the greater picture,
characters differ one from another in the translations
just as they do in the original.” (Rybicki, 2006, p.102)
The differences between two translations that were
established will help create the linkages between these
findings and the reader reception, reviews, and critical
analysis of two translations. We also hope that they
will help trace the contours along which the creation of
the new variant and new literary rendering begins to
emerge and the differences that speak directly to the
explicit, direct, and laconic style of Pike’s translation.
We plan to extend this work to include M. D. Herter
Norton’s translation (1949) of The Notebooks of Malte
Laurids Brigge and to investigate how well this method
generalizes to different translations of different genres.

Digitization efforts by many museums, libraries and
other institutions, and the massive growth of both usergenerated and professional digital content opens us
new possibilities for the study of media and visual
cultures. To explore these possibilities, in 2007 we set
Software Studies Initiative at University of California,
San Diego. Since 2009, our research has been
focused on exploring manga culture — specifically,
883 manga titles comprising 1 million digitized pages
that were available as scanlations on onemanga.com
in the Fall 2009. We have downloaded this whole
image set along with the user-assigned tags indicating
the genres and intended audiences for these titles
and begun its analysis using digital image analysis,
visualization, statistics, and data mining techniques.

show visualizations that show how visual language of
titles changes during the duration of their publication.
To research the relations between visual language,
genre and gender/age categories in manga market as
manifested in our sample (i.e. issue 2), we analyzed
connections between 35 user-assigned tags (4 for
audience type — shoujo, shounen, josei and seinen
— and 31 for genres) available for 883 titles. We
found that all tags form a connected network — i.e.
any two tags occur together at least once. While
some genre tags are more likely to be assigned to
a particular audience segment, none of these genre
tags are exclusive to male or female audiences. These
empirical findings support two ideas. First, rather than
thinking of "action," "adventure," "romance," or any
other genre category as a distinct genre, we should
instead understand them as genre traits that, according
to the perception of manga fans, can be combined in
a single title. Second, as constructed by these genre
traits, the gender categories female / male strongly
overlap.
Digital image analysis and visualization of manga
pages supports the similar conclusions. If we organize
1 million manga pages by their visual characteristics
and then select all pages corresponding to shoujo
and shounen titles, we find that these two sets of
pages form overlapping fuzzy "clouds." In other words,
while large proportions of pages have distinct visual
characteristics that identify them as belonging to
shoujo or shounen category, a significant percentage
of pages have an "androgynous" visual language.

Our paper presents our methods and some of the key
findings of this ongoing research. The discussion is
framed by three larger issues: 1) What are the new
possibilities for describing visual language of manga
made possible by using digital image analysis? 2)
What do we learn by combining the software-assisted
analysis of individual manga pages and the analysis of
user-assigned tags? 3) What does the analysis of large
cultural data sets such as 1 million manga pages tells
us about cultural categories such as style and genre?

Finally, we discuss how the analysis of 1 million manga
pages leads us to to rethink the concept of style.
Consider visualization which shows ourcomplete set
of 1 million pages. The pages in the bottom part of
the visualization are the most graphic (they have the
least amount of detail). The pages in the upper right
have lots of detail and texture. The pages with the
highest contrast are on the right, while pages with
the least contrast are on the left. In between these
four extremes, we find every possible stylistic variation.
This suggests that manga visual language should be
understood as a continuous variable.

As an example of (1), we present 2D visualizations that
show sets of manga pages organized by their visual
characteristics measured by software (for instance, the
presence of texture/detail and the amount of black in a
page). Such visualizations allow us to compare visual
language of individual titles, groups of titles, all titles by
a particular artist, or 1 million manga pages and large
sets of other kinds of images. As another example, we

This, in turn, suggests that the very concept of style
as it is normally used maybe problematic then we
consider large cultural data sets. The concept assumes
that we can partition a set of works into a small number
of discrete categories. However, if we find a very large
set of variations with very small differences between
them (such as in this case), it is no longer possible to
use this model. Instead, it is more appropriate to use

visualizations and/or mathematical models to describe
the space of possible and realized variations.

1. Extended Abstract
The problem of overlapping structures has long
been familiar to the digital humanities community.
Early on, the purely hierarchical structure has been
identified as an important shortcoming of XML for
the representation of meaningful features of complex
works in the humanities. For example, the verse and
line structures of a poem do not necessarily nest
properly, but may overlap. To capture that complexity,
it is necessary to host both structures in the same
digital object, something which pure XML cannot do
directly.
It is customary to represent the structure of a markedup document by deriving from it a graph in which the
adjacency relation among nodes corresponds to the
embedding relation among the marked-up elements
of the document. It is well known that, through such
a construction, XML documents correspond to the
subclass of graphs known as trees.
Numerous approaches to extend or specialize XML or
SGML to handle overlapping structures in various ways
have been proposed in the literature over the years
(see for instance [B1995]). Some of these approaches
work on the graph-structure view of XML. The graphstructure is no more required to be a tree, but it
must still satisfy basic constraints (e.g., finiteness,
non-circularity) that make them plausible models for
“documents.” One such proposal is the GODDAG
(General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph
[SH2004]). Roughly, GODDAGs are like XML trees
except that they allow multiple parenthood and do not
require a total ordering on leaf nodes. (Thus, XML trees
constitute a subset of GODDAGs.)

178

Digital Humanities 2011

Other proposals address the problem by working
on the markup language side. In this group, we
find pure XML solutions (which represent the nonhierarchical structures through coding conventions
and a corresponding ad hoc layer of semantics,
e.g., milestones, fragmentation, virtual elements, etc.
[B1995] [SH1999] [W2005]) and non-XML ones, based
on generalizations of XML allowing non-embedding
constructs, such as overlapping elements. Among
the latter is TexMecs [HS2003], an XML-like markup
language allowing overlapping elements (as well as
other constructs).
An interesting question is how the various proposals
compare with respect to their expressive power.
Beyond a few obvious subset/superset relations that
exist among the formalisms, very little is known in
this area. In 2008, Marcoux established a result
[M2008] linking a subclass of GOODAGs to a subset
of TexMecs. Overlap-only TexMecs (or oo- TexMecs)
is the subset of TexMecs that uses only embedding
and overlapping elements (and none of the other
constructs). A graph whose structure corresponds
to an oo-TexMecs document is said to be ooserializable. Marcoux showed (essentially) that the ooserializable GODDAGs are exactly the completionacyclic ones, thus showing that oo-TexMecs and the
class of completion-acyclic GODDAGs have the same
expressive power.
In this paper, we extend that result in two ways. First,
we define child-ordered directed graphs (CODGs), a
class of graphs strictly larger than that of GODDAGs,
and argue that, in spite of its generality, it still captures
a plausible and interesting notion of “document.” Then,
we show that the strictly stronger expressive power
of the CODG, compared to the GODDAG, vanishes
when oo-serializability is required. This constitutes a
strong indication that overlap-only markup languages
may be insufficient for representing complex document
structures.
More precisely, we show that the classes of singleroot CODGs and GODDAGs coincide when restricted
to completion-acyclic graphs. There are, however,
completion-acyclic multiple-root CODGs that are not
oo- serializable. We show that, for multiple-root
CODGs, the stronger condition of full-completionacyclicity characterizes oo-serializability.
The definition of fully-completion-acyclic graph does
not in itself suggest an efficient algorithm for checking
the condition, nor for computing a corresponding
overlap-only document when the condition is satisfied.
We present ideas that could be exploited to accomplish
those tasks efficiently.

The main conclusion of this work is that markup
languages that generalize XML only by allowing
overlapping elements may not be expressive enough
to represent complex document structures. Indeed,
our results show that the requirement that a graph
be serializable in an overlap-only language effectively
prevents the presence of too complex structures in
the graph. The new graph structure introduced in
the paper, the CODG, is of interest in itself as an
abstract document model. Finally, the ideas we present
on how to detect whether a graph is serializable
using only overlapping elements and on how to then
compute a serialization would be helpful in authoring
environments, because they would allow serializing
documents using the most simple constructs (e.g.,
overlapping elements) whenever possible, while
resorting to more complex constructs (e.g., virtual
elements) only when absolutely necessary.

For presenters and attendees at DH2011, there is no
need to sing the praises of the digital world. We are the
early adopters, the converted, the evangelists. But our
colleagues across the humanities are not yet entirely
convinced, and of more concern to me, neither are
the students. I direct the museum studies track of the
masters in public history at the University of South
Carolina, one of the oldest public history programs in
the country. It is a nationally competitive program, and
our graduates have an impressive placement record:
the Smithsonian; the National Park Service; federal,
state, and local government. And yet, since I joined
the faculty three years ago, I have been shocked
that the students – the so-called digital natives –
have little interest in the digital world as part of their
professional training. They may communicate with
each other using Facebook, share photos on Flickr,
or post to their personal blogs, but when it comes
to coursework they expect, and sometimes demand,
a traditional graduate seminar where we read and
discuss books. More than one student has balked
at my assignments, whining, “I don’t need to learn
how to program. I just want to be a regular historian.”
Unyielding in my persistence, I argue back that it is
no longer an option. Wikis, blogs, and tweeting are
everyday realities for museum professionals. At the
very minimum, all curators and collections managers
need to have a basic understanding of database
architecture in order to structure their object databases
and construct useful queries. More importantly, two
decades of digitization has created new questions
for curators of three-dimensional objects: What does
material culture look like on the web? How do you
curate it? How does the public interact with virtual
objects? What is the relationship between virtual and
physical museum artifacts?
Each fall I teach HIST 787: Material Culture Studies,
the foundational graduate seminar for the museums
track in our masters program. On the first day of class,
I ask the students to bring in five objects that describe
either themselves or their research interests. I tell them
to choose wisely, as they will be using those objects
180

Digital Humanities 2011

every week for the entire semester, but otherwise I
give no guidance to object selection. The objects serve
multiple purposes throughout the semester, but most
importantly they are part of a larger project to create an
object database that represents the changing attitudes
towards material culture in the digital age. Each year
the students must create an online exhibit drawing
from the objects in the database, the objects of both
their classmates as well as the students of previous
years. Clearly each year the number of objects in the
database increases, and the distance from the early
contributors becomes greater. I am in Year 3 of what
I anticipate to be a decade long study, and this short
paper presentation is designed to give preliminary
results. Because this course is part of a two-year
masters degree, this is the first year where the students
do not have direct access to the owners of objects from
previous classes.
I have chosen Omeka as the platform for this
assignment. Although I am well aware of the
limitations, as well as the potential, of the open source
software, Omeka has a low barrier for entry. Omeka
was developed by George Mason University’s Center
for History and New Media with non-IT specialists
in mind. CHNM’s goal was (and continues to be)
to provide museum and library professionals with a
tool that allows them to concentrate on content and
interpretation without worrying about programming. I
am concerned that by using a black box application
my students don’t fully understand the implications of
engaging with the virtual world. However, that is one of
the compromises I have made in order to encourage
budding historians to get their toes wet in the digital
arena.
For their final assignment, students must create
records for each of their objects, which includes
uploading images, entering Dublin Core metadata,
tagging objects with key words, and writing short
descriptions. The students then must curate their own
exhibit, either by using one of the theme templates
provided by CHNM or by creating their own. The open
source software allows students who are more skilled
or interested in web design to create more elaborate
exhibits.

(either formally or informally) than a few hours of online
tutorials can provide. More generously, these online
exhibits are often the first experience students have
in curating, and so one of the assignment’s goals
is for students to gain skills in developing effective
narrative techniques (useful in both physical and digital
curation). In assessing their work, it is important to be
mindful of the learning process; remember that they
are professionals in training, and they should not be
judged on their first attempt but rather on the progress
they achieve by the time they graduate.
However, as a pedagogical device, the assignment
has been tremendously successful. By working
through the process of creating an online exhibit,
the students naturally confront the many epistemic
questions relating to the use of physical objects in a
virtual environment. Students immediately recognize
the diverse challenges of working in the digital format,
from the pedestrian, such as how to search for items
when a previous user failed to enter appropriate
metadata, to the substantial, such as questioning the
ethics of using an object as a metonym in an exhibit
that is antithetical to the physical object’s authenticity.
My goal for the assignment is not for students to
become master web designers, but for them to engage
in the questions confronting digital curation.
Although I could talk at length about the implications of
this ongoing assignment, this short paper will focus on
the joint challenges of curating digital resources and
the role of digital humanities in the academic curricula
– how are universities training the next generation
of museum professionals who will have to confront
digital curation. My presentation will be a snap shot
of a longitudinal study that is currently in progress. I
will briefly describe the assignment, its goals, and the
unexpected lessons learned thus far. I hope to reach
fellow members of the academy to discuss effective
teaching techniques while at the same time seeking
feedback from museum professionals as to what skills
they believe graduating students should have. How
do professors balance the need to provide theoretical
training in how to read and interpret material culture
while fostering the development of technical skills in an
ever-changing digital landscape?

So far the results of the online exhibits have been
mostly disastrous. As a whole, the exhibits are
terrible (available at http://hist787.cas.sc.edu).
They have clunky navigation, lack any elegance in
design, and often are just plain boring. In many ways,
the exhibits are proof of my distrust of black box
software for developing online exhibits and are an
indicator that anyone who wants to engage seriously
in the virtual world needs significantly more training

1. Introduction
Research in narrative intelligence applies artificial
intelligence approaches to study human ability to
organize experience into narrative form (Mateas and
Sengers 2003). Narratives are traditionally defined
as “a series of temporally ordered clauses” (Labov
1972, p360-361). The time-centric approach leads to a
lesser consideration of space in narrative construction
and analysis. In contrast, we advocate a geospatial
narrative in order to stress the importance of space
and time in understanding the ordering and spatial
interaction of events.
We define a geospatial narrative as a sequence of
events in which space and time are equally important.
Narratives are stories that constitutes sequential
organizations of events (Franzosi 2010). Each event
in a narrative relates sequential or consequential
occurrence in space and time. The conventional
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) center on
information about spatial states of reality, and temporal
information is handled as add-ons to spatial objects.
Alternatively, we conceptualize a narrative GIS that
emphasizes representing and ordering events in space
and time as well as functional abilities to construct
meaningful geospatial narratives. While an event is a
complex, fuzzy term, we start with one basic linguistic
element of narratives: action, as the primitive data
construct to start building a narrative GIS. By relating
action events across space and time, a narrative
GIS aims to discover spatiotemporal correlates among
actions and relate actions across scales.

182

Depending on the perspectives, there are many
kinds of events, e.g. instantaneous events, discrete
events, cyclic events, transitional events, and others.
In contrast to TimeMaps (Farrimond et al. 2008), our
vision of a Narrative GIS goes beyond spatiotemporal
visualization to spatial analytics. By using action
events as the primitive data constructs, a narrative
GIS can support spatial queries of sequential and
consequential actions. A Narrative GIS is therefore
capable of revealing how time unfolds change and
space unfolds interactions (Massey 2005).
We use two distinctive corpuses of histories in
building narrative GIS databases and narrative
analytics as a proof of concepts: Dyer's Compendium
of the War of the Rebellion and the Richmond
Daily Dispatch. Frederick H. Dyers, a Civil War
veteran compiled the Compendium based on
materials from the Official Records of the Union
and Confederate Armies and other sources. The
compendium lists organizations and movements of
regiment cavalries mustered by State and Federal
Governments for services in the Union Armies.
Collaborating with the digital scholarship group
at the University of Richmond, we have started
with four files from Dyer's Compendium: the 45th
Massachusetts Infantry, the 107th Pennsylvania
Infantry,the1stCaliforniaInfantry,andthe1stNewYorkCavalry.
The Richmond Daily Dispatch was one of the primary
news media in the south during the Civil War. The
newspaper was one of the most widely distributed
newspapers of the south and included news from
the entire east coast. The Richmond Daily Dispatch
retained the reputation as politically unbiased was
published throughout the Civil War.

2. Methodology
Our idea of a narrative GIS consists of (1) semantic
elements (who did what), (2) temporal elements
(when), and (3) spatial elements (where). A geospatial
narrative object integrates the three elements and
enables search for and analysis of spatial and
temporal relationships among narrative objects. Input
data for narrative GIS vary widely from structured to
unstructured sources. In this study, both input data
are texts, albeit in very different structures. Dyer's
Compendium concisely lists regiment movements.
Richmond Daily Dispatch consists of news articles.
Spatial and temporal connections among units in
these texts are considerably different. Nevertheless,
the conceptual framework of a narrative GIS demands
the identifications of semantic, temporal, and spatial
elements from the texts to form narrative objects
and relationships. As such, our workflow includes six

Digital Humanities 2011

key steps: (1) extract text analysis units; (2) identify
action verbs; (3) identify time for words and text units;
(4) identify locations for words and text units; (5)
combine all identified elements into a GIS database;
and (6) build spatial and temporal relationships among
narrative objects. A schematic view of the workflow is
presented in figure 1

2008; Gibson 2008). These data are assembled in
GIS and each location is identified with a historically
and spatially appropriate hierarchy. The names of
geographic locations are often highly ambiguous. For
example “Georgetown” has over 70 possible locations
among U.S. cities. Disambiguating a word to its true
location is an important and difficult task. A substantial
amount of work has already been done on location
disambiguation under the heading of “Toponym
Resolution” (Leidner2007;Leidneretal2003). Figure 2
illustrates the steps in the location referencing process.

Figure 1

We begin with electronic versions of the historical
documents. The texts are split into subsets such as
newspaper articles or book chapters for processing.
These subsets are typically written as a unit and need
to be analyzed that way for successful interpretation.
For each processing unit, we apply natural language
processing to tokenize sentences and identify parts of
speech (e.g. verbs and nouns). The parts of speech
provide important clues to extract information.
The work presented here is centered on the location,
time, and other characteristics of events. The part
of speech tagging is used to identify verbs. We are
most interested in “action” verbs and refine our list of
potential candidates by removing stative and modal
verbs. Location referencing begins with recognition of
a standard grammatical structure to the way locations
appear in text. In general, locations are proper nouns
that do not directly follow a determiner (except for
physical features).
Candidate words are matched to all their possible
real-world geographic referents in the “Gazetteer
Matching” process. A number of different gazetteers
are utilized in the matching including the US Populated
Places gazetteer and State hydrography datasets from
the USGS, historical counties, states, and territories
files from National Historical Geographic Information
System, and the US Census Bureau’s historical 100
largest cities dataset (US BGN; US NHD; NHGIS

Figure 2

The temporal processing steps aim to extract dates,
durations of events and the relative temporal ordering
between events. Historical texts contain temporal
information in a variety of formats. Most obvious are
explicit dates that include information such as the
day, month and year. In addition, these texts often
include clues to derive dates and relative ordering of
events. For example words such as “yesterday“ or
“last week” allow the date to be derived based on
a temporal relation to an anchor date (Han 2006).
Similarly, relative temporal expressions allow explicit
dates to be determined based on temporal relations to
the current temporal focus (Han 2009).
Figure 3 outlines the steps in our approach.

183

Digital Humanities 2011

Figure 3

We begin by extracting anchor dates such as the
date of publication for a newspaper article and explicit
dates found in the text. We use temporal indicator
words to refine the date of events and help establish
temporal ordering. Explicit dates contained in the
text are modified by deictic or temporal expressions.
Semantic relationships between events are extracted
based on semantic indicators. When all of the temporal
information is relative and there are no explicit dates
to give an explicit order, thirteen temporal relationships
are used to find the temporal ordering (Allen 1983).

3. Results and Concluding Remarks
Thus far, our effort has been focused on extraction
of events from the natural language text sources,
anchoring the events to geographical locations and
in time, and extracting information on the actors and
objects involved in the events. Figure 4 illustrates
results from Dyer's Compendium of the War of the
Rebellion.

Figure 4

This figure shows the activity of the 6th New
York Regiment Calvary in Maryland and Virginia in
September and October of 1862. The processing
identified the events including the regiment’s
movements and splitting off of a reconnaissance
mission from Lovettsville to Smithville while the main
regiment moved to Kearnysville. While this example
from a single source, it illustrates the potential for the
system to support more complex geospatial narratives
with the addition of information from other sources.
Figure 5 shows a visualization of a Richmond Daily
Dispatch article.

Figure 5

The article describes a letter from a Union colonel to
his family. It discusses the Union’s plan to move troops
184

Digital Humanities 2011

to Alexandria Virginia the next evening. The article
illustrates that in addition to working with events that
had already occurred the approach can also be used
to help investigate the thoughts and motivation leading
to events that had yet to occur.

Workshop on Spatial and Temporal Reasoning

These examples of preliminary results demonstrate the
basic use of a Narrative GIS. As we continue building
the event narrative database, additional functions will
be built in for narrative analytics. For example, we
are interested in deciphering the local, regional and
national processes on emancipation and to identify
scalar effects on military, political, and individual
processes. One approach will be extracting reports
on battles and run-away slaves and analyze spatial
and temporal correlations among these events. When
we extract events of different categories in space
and time, a Narrative GIS will allow us to analyze
spatial and temporal relationships among these kinds
of events to draw insights into the integration of
multiple perspectives and interpretations of geospatial
narratives.

Charlotte’s Web: Encoding
the Literary History of the
Sentimental Novel

Ever since the cultural turn in literary studies,
literary scholarship has focused on examining the
cultural work performed by texts. Indeed, one of the
enduring theoretical innovations of the 1980s was the
reconceptualization of literary value according to the
concept of cultural work—the idea that texts should be
evaluated not by the innate aesthetic or formal qualities
they manifested, but according to their “designs upon
their audience” and their ability “to make people think
and act in a particular way” (Tompkins 1985). As
a result, previously overlooked or marginalized texts
have often been deemed suitable for study in the
ensuing years based largely the on degree to which
they are said to perform particular kinds of cultural
work. In one familiar example from the arena of
nineteenth-century American literature, scholars have
come to see a stereotypically sentimental novel like
Uncle Tom’s Cabin as a canonical work primarily
because its complex entanglements with the politics of
the antebellum United States allow it to be read— to
cite Tompkins once more—as part of a “monumental
effort to reorganize culture.” But while this approach
has become an important characteristic of much
literary scholarship, the question of how to measure a
given text’s capacity to perform cultural work remains
vague and often myopically focused on the synchronic
significance of the work in question at a specific point
in time.
In this paper we investigate the matter of cultural work
from the vantage point offered by current scholarship
in the digital humanities. We do so with an eye
toward developing a model of literary history that
draws on uniquely digital methods for structuring and
formalizing intertextual relationships, and that make it
possible to chart the cultural and formal significance
of literary works across space and time. Specifically,
we use Susanna Rowson’s late eighteenth-century
sentimental novel Charlotte Temple as a case study in
186

how digital literary history can evaluate the meaning
and formal significance of a text diachronically. Often
cited as one of the earliest American bestsellers,
Rowson’s work was reprinted hundreds of times
during the nineteenth century and was referenced
repeatedly in an extensive body of writing, ranging from
reviews and advertisements to melodramatic stage
adaptations and ostensibly factual regional histories
of the United States. Tracking the novel’s extended
nineteenth-century afterlife through this complex
network of external references, we demonstrate how
the application of detailed interpretive markup to the
multiple documents that reference Charlotte Temple
(instead of the novel that would, more conventionally,
be thought of as the “primary” text) enacts a theory of
literary history in which concepts of cultural work may
best be observed as phenomena that develop over
time.
While the idea of interpretive markup is not new, it is
most often used either as a means of recording a layer
of scholarly annotation on some particular document
or classifying portions of a document according to
some external taxonomy. Both uses are supported,
for instance, by the current version of the Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines, which provides
examples of specific methods for encoding “semantic
or syntactic interpretation” using a set of standard
TEI XML elements and attributes. In practice, though,
discussions of interpretive markup in digital humanities
projects often revolve around questions of readability
and the appropriateness of stand-off versus inline
markup (e.g. does excessive interpretive markup pose
problems for human readability of encoded text?
[Campbell 2002]), or issues of preservation, curation,
and reliability (e.g. what challenges for encoding
textual information accurately and reliably are created
by allowing extensive interpretive markup? [Berrie et
al. 2006]). Although such questions are important
in certain contexts, our project treats them as less
important than the question of how interpretive markup
may be enlisted as a surface for scholarly analysis—
that is, how interpretive structures can themselves be
classified and interpreted.
Our project adapts several of the interpretive structures
provided in TEI XML to represent the connection
between specific formal properties in Charlotte Temple
and external evidence of the novel’s broader cultural
influence, as attested by external references to it. We
record basic metadata about each external reference
(author, title, date and location of publication, etc.)
while also indicating which specific features of the
novel the reference comments on, as well as the nature
of that commentary. The result is a set of XML-encoded

Digital Humanities 2011

documents classified according to the interpretive work
they do: a record, as it were, of how nineteenth-century
readers interpreted and responded to the novel’s
formal properties. At the same time, a secondary
layer of interpretive markup further formalizes
the relationships we identify across this primary
layer of interpretation. Taken together, both layers
provide substantial material for further abstraction:
for instance, the automated generation of topic
maps that represent a variety of cultural knowledge
structures. The result is a web of connections in
the form of citations, references, allusions, parodies,
and comments spanning the nineteenth century,
whose formalized structures constitute the interpretive
tissue of digital literary history. The ability to map
and visualize these structures, we argue, offers
significantly new possibilities for observing cultural
work as a phenomenon that evolves over time,
and whose connection to particular texts is most
productively understood as operating at the nexus of
close reading and “distant reading” strategies.

practice they often coexist harmoniously—they inflect
the concept of literary history in crucially different ways.
The former often treats the machine-processable
language of texts as a primary axis along which
historical change in writing manifests itself: intertextual
relationships are revealed in changing patterns of
linguistic borrowing, with the emphasis on facilitating
the “comparability of texts” (Mueller 2008). The latter,
while still valuing intertextual comparison, tends to
prioritize the documentary and contextual over the
linguistic—for instance recording textual variation
across editions of the same text, or formalizing through
encoding “rich environmental contextualizations” for
the study of particular texts (Folsom 2007). Our project
borrows from both strategies, and in doing so seeks
to demonstrate in practice a method by which digital
literary history negotiates this apparent bifurcation.

Our work constitutes an initial small-scale experiment,
but it has relevance for larger questions of scale,
purpose, and method in both the digital humanities
and conventional modes of literary scholarship. In
particular, it suggests that although digital scholarship
offers a potential reconceptualization of literary history,
practices of literary history also pose interesting
challenges for work in the digital humanities. In
recent years, projects in the digital humanities have
increasingly responded to the question of scale by
refining methods for aggregating, classifying, and
analyzing enormous bodies of textual material—in
other words, by treating text as a mass of data
that can yield meaningful responses to statistical
analysis of its language. Whether offering answers
to now-familiar questions about scale itself— “What
do you do with a million books?”—or taking up
Franco Moretti’s challenge to peer into the “cellars
of culture” represented by the tens of thousands
of unread and unknown novels published in the
nineteenth century, text mining and other forms of
“computational humanities” have been increasingly
held up as a means of “checking the generalizations of
literary history”(Crane 2006; Parry 2010; Pasanek and
Sculley 2008). At the same time, long-running digital
humanities projects with deep investments in scholarly
text encoding have tended to approach literary
history from the opposite direction, emphasizing
how “craft encoding,” for instance, employs editorial
methodologies and modes of textual scholarship that
participate in “making literary history” in the digital
medium (Flanders 2009; Dimock 2007). While neither
approach directly contradicts the other—indeed, in

The Digital Dictionary of
Buddhism: A Collaborative XMLBased Reference Work that
has become a Field Standard:
Technology and Sustainable
Management Strategies

The Digital Dictionary of Buddhism (DDB) (http://
buddhism-dict.net/ddb/subscribing_libraries.html),
now on the Web for more than 15 years, has
come to be regarded as a primary reference work
for the field of Buddhist Studies. Containing over
54,000 entries, it is subscribed to by more than
38 university libraries (http://www.buddhism-dict.net/
ddb/subscribing_libraries.html). It is supported by the
contributions of over 70 specialists, many of these
recognized leaders in the field. It can perhaps be
described as example of the type of web resource
hoped for by Jaron Lanier in his book You Are Not
A Gadget, or something similar to the sort of thing
envisioned by Joseph Raben in his Busa lecture at
the DH2010, in the sense of being the fruit of the
collaborative efforts of a community of scholars that
has reached a degree of status and sustainability
such that it has been able to grow and thrive—
despite having little funding or the support of a major
organization or team of programmers—in the age
where such resources are so readily eclipsed by the
combination of Wikipedia and Google. The field of
Buddhist Studies has its own reliable, scholarly-edited,
fully documented and responsible online reference
work that has developed a center of gravity sufficient
for it to continue to grow as the resource that specialists
turn to without hesitation, and to which they may
contribute knowing that they will be clearly accredited,
and that what they write will not be deleted or changed
in the following moment by, for example, a junior high
school student.
With the DDB having a history almost equal in length
to that of the WWWeb as we know it (it went online
in 1995), there is a wide range of issues that can
be discussed beyond its present technical structure.
Of great importance are the management strategies
that have allowed its continued progress through the
188

Digital Humanities 2011

long series of changes the Web has witnessed during
this first epoch of the Internet. How, exactly, can a
project that is based on the continual development of
quantity and quality of reference data can continue to
grow to the extent of becoming the de facto primary
field reference work after exhausting the first couple
initial grants, without either becoming a fully “pay-for”
resource (perhaps being bought out by a commercial
enterprise of some sort), or being supported by some
private organization — an alternative fraught with the
danger of forcing the resource to co-opt its principles
and its objectivity?
I began the compilation of the DDB and its companion
CJKV-English Dictionary (CJKV-E) in 1986, originally
simply envisioning the eventual publication of the usual
printed work. In 1994, however, the Web made its
appearance, and the potential advantages of trying
to develop a reference work online in a collaborative
manner were immediately apparent. So in the middle
of 1995, I converted my WordPerfect word-processor
files to HTML, and placed the dictionary on the web. To
my great elation, I was soon contacted by a few good
scholars with similar interests, who were willing to offer
both content and technical advice.
During its first few years on the web, the DDB was
maintained in a simple, hard-linked HTML format.
With the help of Christian Wittern, this source was
converted to SGML, and then XML. A major turning
point in the history of the project came in January
2001, when Michael Beddow offered to help with Web
implementation, and for the first time, the raw XML
data was searched and presented to users through
a combination of Perl and XML/XSLT technology. At
that time, building a search engine that could deal with
mixed Western/CJK text in UTF-8 encoding was a not
at all a simple matter, so Michael's search engine was
a bit of a novel creation—and was able to serve its
purpose with only minor tweaks up through most of
2010, for almost a full decade.
When Michael Beddow's search engine was set up
in 2001, usage of the DDB increased dramatically.
Yet despite our repeated pleas for user contributions,
except for a very small number of “enlightened”
individuals who somehow naturally grasped the
meaning of this strange new thing called “web
collaboration,” it became apparent that there were
very, very few people willing, on their own, to take
five or ten minutes to write up and send us even
a couple of terms from their own research work.
This lack of interest on the part of users in making
contributions was extremely disappointing. Thus, while
our password security system was originally set up to
ward off hacking attempts, we decided to experiment

with using this apparatus to institute a two-tiered
system of access. In the first level, any user could
access the data a limited number of times in a
24-hour period, logging in as guest. In the second
level, contributors were granted unlimited access.
We started off setting the guest limit at fifty, but
leaving it at this amount for a few weeks we received
neither complaints nor contributions. We then began
to gradually drop the number down to forty, thirty,
and then twenty searches in a day. At twenty, there
was still nary a complaint made nor contribution to be
seen. But when we hit the number of ten, everything
changed. We were first bombarded with indignant
complaints, but holding the line, and at the same time
lowering the minimum required level of contribution
to the equivalent of one A4 page for two years of
access, eventually these complaints began to turn
into contributions. This was a watershed moment
for the project, because we found that once people
contributed one time, most of them continued to do so,
whether voluntarily, or by continued prompting through
this same arrangement.
At the time of my first public presentation of the DDB
at a meeting of the Electronic Buddhist Text Initiative
(EBTI http://buddhism-dict.net/ebti/) in 1996, the DDB
contained approximately 3,200 entries. That number
is now over 54,000, with a present average growth
rate of 4,000 terms per year. The continued growth in
popularity of the DDB, especially as a reference work
for graduate and undergraduate courses in Buddhist
Studies in North America and Europe generated one
more access problem that needed resolution—that of
how to allow for the use of the DDB in the case
where an instructor wanted to use the dictionary for
an university course. To deal with these kinds of
situations, we decided to begin to offer subscriptions
to university library networks for a modest fee. This
policy brought about an unforeseen benefit, in that we
could now provide a list of reputable institutions that
had deemed the DDB to be an academic reference
of high standards. It also generated a small but
steady income, which allowed us to pay for hardware
and software, and a couple of part-time workers to
do input and editing. Finally, in order to encourage
contribution from qualified scholars, great effort was
expended toward letting members of the field know
of the contributions being made by their colleagues.
Thus on the dictionary's web site itself, as well as on
associated news and mail lists, information regarding
new contributions is energetically distributed.
This presentation will start off with a short
demonstration of the most advanced functions of
the DDB, to be followed by a brief overview of its
189

Digital Humanities 2011

technical framework (P5- influenced XML, delivered
through XSL and Perl). We will then outline the aboveintroduced key factors of the management of the DDB
that we believe have most directly contributed to its
great success.

1. Abstract
To support the development of curricular content
for the Data Curation Education Program (DCEP)
at the Graduate School of Library and Information
Science (GSLIS), University of Illinois at Urbana
Champaign, a needs analysis case study focusing
on digital humanities centers was carried out in late
2010. Collectively the results paint an interesting
picture of the perception of humanities data curation
needs by directors and key staff. Several results
were contrary to what we anticipated; for instance,
there was only modest agreement on critical areas
of expertise needed to sustain meaningful access
to digital humanities scholarship over time. Most
importantly, there was one result that, if confirmed,
could have a substantial impact on the design of
data curation education programs. In the humanities,
center directors and managers appear to resist the

190

Digital Humanities 2011

notion that a particular staff role, that of data curator,
is specifically needed, preferring instead to develop
distributed expertise and responsibilities as part of
existing staff roles, calling on institutional resources
as needed. This suggests, among other things, that
the standing recommendation to place data curation
professionals “upstream” in projects may need to be
re-envisioned in this context.

2. Introduction
Data curation has been described as “the active
and ongoing management of data throughout
its entire lifecycle of interest and usefulness to
scholarship” (Cragin et al., 2007). Curation activities
enable data discovery and retrieval, maintain quality,
add value, and provide for re-use over time. Originally
conceptualized as an e-Science problem precipitated
by large amounts of data in digital formats, data
curation is an emerging problem for the humanities
as well, as both data and analytical practices become
increasingly digital (Renear et al., 2009; Crane, Babeu,
& Bamman, 2007).
GSLIS received a grant from the Institute of Museum
and Library Services (IMLS) to extend the existing
data curation specialization within the school's ALAaccredited master's program to include humanities
data as well as science data (Renear et al., 2009).
Among the activities carried out under the grant was
a study of data management and curation practices
in the digital humanities. The study was designed and
directed by social science researchers from the Center
for Informatics Research in Science and Scholarship
(CIRSS). The main goals were to assess the levels and
types of data curation expertise needed by researchers
actively engaged in digital humanities projects and to
better understand the potential roles that information
professionals trained to meet the unique challenges of
working with humanities data in digital formats might
fulfill.

3. Methods
To develop a rich picture of data curation practices in
the humanities, we employed a case study method,
taking digital humanities centers as our case. We
chose to focus on established digital humanities
centers in preference to libraries, repositories, or
individual research teams or scholars for a number
of reasons. First, many significant early projects were
likely to be located at or affiliated with centers—
meaning these centers have experience handling
data over longer time scales (Daigle, 2005). Second,
centers bring together faculty and staff, and we believe

this makes them sites where the most sophisticated
curation practices are likely to be found (Zorich, 2008).
We interviewed directors and upper-level staff
members at 14 digital humanities centers located in
the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and
Australia with one interview per site. High profile,
established centers were chosen that were available
and willing to participate in the research. Most centers
chosen were located at large research universities
but the size of the centers ranged from several
staff members to large units. Our intuition was that
researchers working at the level of a single project
might see data curation as something inextricably tied
to their specific job and thus not be able to envision
it as a stand-alone function; therefore, upper-level
staff with responsibilities for hiring and coordination
between projects were chosen in order to elicit views of
the curator position from that overarching perspective.
Participants were asked about a range of topics related
to data management including formats and standards,
data storage, security and redundancy, staff roles and
background, and significant unsolved problems.
Study participants completed a pre-interview
worksheet and their responses were used to guide and
focus semi-structured interviews. The pre-interview
worksheet also included a series of questions asking
participants to rank various categories of skills on
a Likert scale ranging from “very important” to “not
important at all” for curating humanities data. From
the ranked list of skills we were able to develop an
overview of researchers' views of data curation in
the context of multi-project digital humanities centers.
From the interviews, we were able to capture more
in-depth information such as complex discussions of
tradeoffs and rationales that could not be adequately
represented in a simple survey. We are therefore able
to report both quantitative and qualitative results from
our case study.

4. Results

4.1. Variability and Convergence of Skills
When asked to rank the importance of various
areas of expertise needed for a data management
professional to be effective working with humanities
data, participants revealed an unexpectedly high
degree of variability in their answers.
From among a list of 30 kinds of expertise provided
in the pre-interview worksheet, at least one study
participant gave each category of knowledge the
highest score, indicating it was “very important.” While
191

Digital Humanities 2011

we can rank order the areas of expertise according to
an average score, the differences between rankings
are not statistically significant by Chi-squared analysis.
However, we observe that a handful of skills were both
highly ranked on average and showed higher positive
skew: every respondent ranked expertise in areas
such as interoperability, markup, database design, and
metadata as being of moderate importance or higher.
Project management also had a high rank order. One
surprising result among our findings was the strong
emphasis on skills related to teaching and training.
This may be due to staff at digital humanities centers
being tasked as consultants to scholarly projects or
it may simply be due to the expectation within the
community that skills will be developed through peerto-peer training in the course of carrying out job duties.
Overall, our results coupled with interview data could
not identify a consensus as to the most relevant areas
of expertise needed by staff engaged in humanities
data curation.

4.2. Organizational and Management
Trends
Our interviews reveal a picture of current practice in
which the work of data management and curation
at digital humanities centers is parceled out among
multiple staff members at multiple levels in the
organizational hierarchy. Important data curation tasks
may be left for scholars or managers of projects to
decide individually, or they may be handled by staff,
who work on multiple projects for a center, or they may
be outsourced to other campus units above the level
of the center.
The staff who did have responsibility for data
management and curation at the centers we studied
were often either those with programming, systems
administration, or other IT training, or were people
who had received advanced training in a humanities
discipline and had taught themselves technical skills.
In keeping with the emphasis on interoperability noted
in our quantitative results and also perhaps in response
to a changing funding environment and newly available
services, we observed a trend in which efforts were
being made to move data management expertise from
the staff member who had developed it in the course of
his or her duties to a center-wide or perhaps institutionwide level where it would be a part of documentation
and institutional memory rather than personal memory.
However, our interviews with managers also suggest
that even though data management and curation
is beginning to be elevated to a higher position in
organizations, there is skepticism about the potential
192

role for a data curator at digital humanities centers.
Participants in our study were interested in adding
skills relevant to data curation to their organizations but
rather than doing so in the form of a dedicated position
for an information professional, they appeared to be
looking for staff with computing or disciplinary skills
who also had some training in data curation.
This finding is consistent with another trend we
observed. Just as digital humanities centers are
already using outside groups such as campus IT
or vendors for certain aspects of data management,
we noted an increasing orientation to and interest
in working with campus-wide services such as
institutional repositories to curate humanities data.

5. Discussion
Since effective curation, management, and
preservation of data in digital formats involves
intervention at every stage of the data lifecycle from
creation onwards, it has been a common belief in the
data curation community that information professionals
trained in curation will need to work “upstream” in
scientific labs and digital humanities centers (Swan
& Brown, 2008). The current resistance of directors
of humanities data centers to such dedicated data
curation staff must be taken seriously as it undoubtedly
reflects relevant experience and judgment, and their
sense of the sorts of arrangements that are likely to
succeed. However, our case study in combination with
prior work on the role of information work in scientific
research suggests that models of provisioning data
curation expertise may need to be more nuanced.
As the humanities become increasingly “data-rich,”
information science research on data management in
the natural sciences becomes increasingly relevant
(Choudhury & Stinson, 2007; Renear, Muñoz, &
Trainor, 2010). For example, intensive case studies
in neuroscience suggest that information services
for researchers are likely to be most effective at
project stages when information work is most routine
or when it is highly speculative, as is often the
case with new interdisciplinary research questions or
in emerging collaborations (Palmer, 2006; Palmer,
Cragin, & Hogan 2007). In the humanities we have also
seen that conceptions of what constitutes information
or support work and what constitutes professional
work within disciplines change in response to the
introduction of digital methodologies (Flanders, 2005;
Bradley, 2008; McCarty, 2009). While the distribution
of curation activities may not follow the same types
of (re)arrangements we are seeing in the sciences,
we still believe that some data curation work will be

Digital Humanities 2011

most effective upstream and integrated into scholars'
research endeavors, such as at decision points about
project planning and re-use value.

As digital curation practices evolve, libraries and
institutional repositories will likely take on a larger
role in curating humanities data in the future. The
results of our study can serve as a useful point of
comparison for future work in this area. In addition
to having someone who owns data curation problems
and manages solutions on a research-center-level,
institutions may explore both how to provide services
from a central organization (such as the university
library) and also, ways to increase the formal, inservice training available to researchers in the digital
humanities.

When to Ask for Help: Evaluating
Projects for Crowdsourcing
Organisciak, Peter

organis2@illinois.edu
University of Illinois, United States of America

A growing online phenomenon is that of
crowdsourcing, where groups of disparate people,
connected through technology, contribute to a
common product. It refers to the collaborative
possibilities of a communications medium as flexible
and as populated as the Internet. If many hands make
light work, crowdsourcing websites show how light the
work can be, breaking tasks into hundreds of pieces
for hundreds of hands. Building from the growing body
of research in the area including the author’s work on
crowd motivations, this paper outlines the necessary
steps and considerations in enriching projects through
crowdsourcing.
Though not new, crowdsourcing as it exists online
has been enabled by emerging technologies. It has
grown out of increasingly efficient – and affordable
– forms of communication. Since such collaboration
has expanded so quickly, there have been few
investigations into the design of crowdsourcing. At the
same time, the most successful projects have emerged
in an organic nature that many deliberate attempts
have failed to replicate, suggesting the need for more
investigation in the area. Jeff Howe, who first defined
the term and popularized the trend, has explained
that “we know crowdsourcing exists because we've
observed it in the wild. However, it's proven difficult to
breed in captivity” (2008).
The gaps in knowledge of online crowds are quickly
being filled however, allowing projects to move away
from reliance on serendipity. This presentation derives
from recently completed thesis work on the motivations
of crowds within crowdsourcing (Organisciak 2010).
While it will reflect that study’s findings on how, its
primary focus is on the equally important questions
of why and when in light of those findings. For which
tasks is crowdsourcing an appealing option and what
resources should be present for a project to adequately
motivate the users? A bottom-up classification of
crowdsourcing categories is proposed, followed by a
checklist of needs that an institution must consider
before attempting their own crowdsourcing.

194

Digital Humanities 2011

In this study, a sample of 300 crowdsourcing sites
was examined and classified. Synthesizing these
classifications resulted in a proposed list of eleven nonexclusive categories for crowdsourcing, six describing
method and five describing structure. Methods include
encoding, creation, idea exchange, skills aggregation,
knowledge aggregation, and opinion aggregation.
Additionally, there are financial, platform, gaming,
group empowerment, and ludic structures observed
within these systems. Derived from existing systems,
these categories and their variants offer unique design
patterns and best practice cases that can assist in
assessing the types of tasks at which they excel.
Appropriateness of the task is just one facet of running
a crowdsourcing project. The other consideration
is whether a project offers a return that potential
participants would find rewarding. In addressing this,
a content analysis was used to identify site design
mechanics related to user experience in thirteen cases
spanning the breadth of the identified categories.
These mechanics were then discussed in a series
of user interviews to determine what users truly care
about. In this study, a collection of primary and
secondary motivators are proposed as foundational
considerations in running a project. The primary
motivators seen in the user interviews were interest in
the topic, ease of entry and of participation, altruism
and meaningful contribution, sincerity, and appeal
to knowledge. A final one, financial incentive, is
perhaps the most blunt. Secondary motivators include
indicators of progress and reputation (i.e. “cred”),
utility, fun, system feedback, social networking, and
fixed windows (i.e. well-groomed quality).
An understanding of the nature of crowdsourcing holds
notable benefits to scholarship in the humanities and
social sciences. Most significantly, this is because it
allows large-scale insights into the qualitative and the
abstract, those areas inextricably linked to the limits
of manpower, unable to be delegated to computing
power. “What is the sentiment of this sentence”,
is the type of question a crowdsourcing site may
ask (Mechanical Turk, May 2nd 2010), if not always
as directly.   Since much work in the arts cannot
easily be quantified, logistics and resources often limit
humanities research to a balance between breadth and
depth; crowdsourcing offers an escape from this issue.
Consider one task that is often seen in existing
crowdsourcing sites: crowd-encoded classification.
Classification tasks are dependent on the personhours available, because person-hours are the only
dependable way to approach these tasks. Whether
directly or incidentally, online crowds can effectively
encode or classify content. Though the reliability

of the end product is often far below that of a
professional encoder, large-scale crowd projects can
often account for this through multiple independent
classifications, measuring consistency and reliability
through agreement.  Galaxy Zoo, an effort from Oxford
to classify galaxies, found crowdsourced data to be
within 10% agreement with the same data classified
professionally (Lintott et al. 2009). The high quality of
work is especially notable because the experiment and
its follow-ups received their 60 millionth classification
in April 2010.
Flickr Commons, an initiative to put photo archives on
a photo-sharing community, is a similar project that
– by way of community-based research, information
and tagging – has enriched the metadata of hundreds
of Library of Congress photographs in the United
States of America (Springer, et al. 2008). Another
pilot project involving public tagging, by the National
Library of Australia, concluded that “tagging is a good
thing, users want it, and it adds more information
to data. It costs little to nothing and is relatively
easy to implement; therefore, more libraries and
archives should just implement it across their entire
collections” (Holley 2010). The National Library of
Australia followed through on this recommendation.
Such projects are often greeted with suspicion in
professional or scholarly communities. The National
Library of Australia report notes that "institutions who
have not implemented user tagging generally perceive
many potential problems that institutions who have
implemented user tagging do not report" (Clayton
et al. 2008 qtd. in Holley 2010). The Library
of Congress report similarly notes many concerns
that critics provided, such as: “Would fan mail,
false memories, fake facts, and uncivil discourse
obscure knowledge? … Would the Library lose
control of its collections? Would library catalogs
and catalogers become obsolete?...Would history be
dumbed-down? Would photographs be disrespected
or exploited?” (Springer et al. 2008). In both cases, the
reports state that the concerns, within the respective
project’s experiences, have not manifested.
Encoding is a notable use of crowdsourcing in
academia, but not the only one. Some projects, such as
the Suda On Line, benefit from collected contributions
of expertise and knowledge. Suda On Line is a
project to translate a Byzantine encyclopedia, Suda,
into English for the first time. It has been steadily
progressing since 1998, producing a comprehensive
resource while staying at a manageable participation
scale (Mahoney 2009). In other cases, crowdsourcing
allows public and volunteer projects to compete with
the scale and quality of commercial projects, as has
195

Digital Humanities 2011

been seen in OpenStreetMap, Project Gutenberg, and
many open source projects.
As crowdsourcing continues to be tested – and if
it continues to be successful – in public institutions,
understanding how to undertake such projects
will become more important. The benefits are
being stated, and the scale and openness on
which public institutions operate makes them a
compatible beneficiary of crowdsourcing activities.
Users appear especially altruistic toward public
projects, emphasizing in this study their preference
for meaningful engagement with institutional workings
over symbolic outreach.
The study informing this work is large, and my hope
is to provide a digestible account of its results. The
reason for this goal is straightforward: there is still
much work to be done in understanding the mechanics
of crowdsourcing, but the potential is great. I hope that
the sharing of this foundational work will encourage
others to explore further.

The Cultural Impact of New
Media on American Literary
Writing: Refining a Conceptual
Framework
Paling, Stephen

paling@wisc.edu
School of Library and Information Studies, University
of Wisconsin-Madison

1. Introduction
This paper describes a survey study 1 that is
part of an ongoing effort (Paling & Martin, 2009;
Paling, 2008; Paling & Nilan, 2006) to extend Social
Informatics(Kling, 1999) to the study of literature
and art. This series of studies has focused on
the emergence of new forms of literary expression
offered by information technology, and whether and
how those possibilities are finding a place alongside
traditional forms of expression in American literary
writing. The study is meant to be complementary to
more discursive, hermeneutic views of literary work.
Discursive discussion of literary work provides rich
descriptions of work by selected authors. In contrast,
a survey enables us to look at the actions of literary
community members in the aggregate. This study is
based, in part, on the idea that various forms of inquiry
into emerging literary practices, taken together, will
provide a more complete picture than any one form
of inquiry alone can provide. Different approaches to
inquiry need not be seen as oppositional.

2. The Previous Studies
The previous studies in this series (Paling and Martin,
2009; Paling, 2008; Paling & Nilan, 2006) developed,
and found support for, a conceptual framework made
up of four key values that typify American literary
writing:
1. Positive Regard for Symbolic Capital.

Springer, Michelle, et. al. (2008). For the Common
Good: The Library of Congress Flickr Pilot Project. .

2. Negative Regard for Immediate Financial Gain.

Mahoney, Anne (2009). 'Tachypaedia Byzantina: The
Suda On Line as Collaborative Encyclopedia'. Digital
Humanities Quarterly. 3.1.

4. Positive Regard for Avant-garde-ism.

196

3. Positive Regard for Autonomy.
Positive regard was operationalized as responses
that indicated admiration or desire for particular
qualities, e.g., a desire to read an author's work based

Digital Humanities 2011

on previous work by that author. Similarly, avantgarde was operationalized as valuation of particular
characteristics, e.g., a preference for literary work that
is fresh or innovative, or electronic work that has
characteristics that cannot be produced in print form.
The previous studies examined the ways in which
literary authors could use information technology to
change those key values. They posited, and found
support for, the idea of Intensifying Use of Technology,
which has three characteristics:
1. Recognition of new forms of support for a value.
2. Incomplete rejection of traditional forms of support
for the value.
3. Placement of greater emphasis on the newer forms
of support.
For example, a fiction writer could use a hypermedia
editor to produce non-linear, electronic fiction
(recognition). She might prefer this newer form of
fiction (greater emphasis on newer form of support),
but also continue to write more traditional work
(incomplete rejection).
The original study in the series (Paling & Nilan,
2006) involved interviews with a purposive sample
for heterogeneity (n=36) of editors of American little
magazines. That study used primarily qualitative
methods. The second study (Paling, 2008) involved
the same sampling method (n=22), but focused on
American literary authors. Paling (2008) used both
qualitative data as well as quantitative data derived
from Likert scales. The third study in the series
(Paling & Martin, 2009) was a pilot survey with a
random sample (n=84), and that study led directly to
the development of the current study. The original
studies all showed the presence of intensifying use
of technology, but differed in terms of how common
that phenomenon seems to be. Because two of the
three samples were non-random, and all three were
relatively small, a larger, random sample will lead to
firmer conclusions about the research questions.

3. The Current Study
The current study concentrated on two research
questions:
1. RQ1: Do members of the American literary
community show support for Positive Regard for
Avant-garde-ism?
2. RQ2: Do the actions of members of the American
literary community reflect Intensifying Use of

Technology with regard to Positive Regard for Avantgarde-ism?
Positive Regard for Avant-garde-ism was selected
from the four key values that make up the conceptual
framework because it is the most relevant to the use
of information technology. It is directly relevant, for
example, to how much participants value the use of
information technology to produce innovative writing
that cannot be done in print. However, the other
key values play an important role in establishing the
context within which a value such as Positive Regard
for Avant-garde-ism comes into play, and they were
retained as an important part of this study.
The current study represents a clear methodological
progression along the line of research begun in the
earlier studies. A total of 900 invitations for participation
were sent out. The names were selected randomly
from a sampling frame built based on publicly available
lists from The Association of Writers and Writing
Programs and the Modern Language Association, as
well as print directories such the Council of Literary
Magazines and Small Presses' Literary Press and
Magazine Directory. This yielded a sample of exactly
400 participants. All of the potential participants live,
work, or study in America, or work for a publisher
whose primary presence is in America. An international
sample would be desirable in the future, but was
beyond the scope and funding level of this study.
The respondents were asked to complete a mail survey
composed of brief yes/no or checklist questions, as
well as questions that included Likert-type numeric
scales. The questions were refined versions from the
interviews in the earlier studies in the series. Data,
and respondent comments, from the earlier studies
uncovered minor problems with question wording,
scaling, etc. Because of that, the data from this study
cannot be combined with data from the earlier studies.
Conclusions from the current study, though, should be
given greater weight than conclusions from the earlier
studies because of the larger, random sample and the
refined questions.

4. Reconciling the Studies
Much of the apparent difference between the previous
studies seems to have resulted from the different
sampling methods used in the studies in this series.
The first two studies (Paling, 2008; Paling & Nilan,
2006), as mentioned earlier, used purposive sampling
for heterogeneity. In other words, an effort was made
to seek out editors and authors who were actively
involved in producing literature with a substantial
electronic component. The strength of purposive
197

Digital Humanities 2011

sampling is that it allows this kind of effort to closely
examine different segments of a community such as
people who participate in American literary writing.
The weakness of such sampling, though, is that it is
very difficult to create a purposive sample that reflects
not just the presence of particular phenomena, but
also an accurate sampling of how widespread the
phenomenon is.
The pilot survey (Paling & Martin, 2009) did
find limited demonstration of Intensifying Use of
Technology. One respondent showed unambiguous
evidence of Intensifying Use of Technology. A
number of other respondents (8) demonstrated
somewhat similar, but less pronounced, patterns of
Intensifying Use of Technology. This would suggest
that somewhere around 10% of the American
literary community demonstrates Intensifying Use of
Technology, although the conceptualization of that
phenomenon may need to be altered to reflect the
opinions of community members who place strong
positive value on technological innovation in literature,
but who do not actually place greater emphasis on
such forms of literature.
Taken together, the previous studies suggest that
we need to modify, but not reject, the concept
of Intensifying use of Technology. Intensifying Use
of Technology is a real phenomenon, but is not,
to date, widespread in American literary writing.
More importantly, the American literary establishment
demonstrates very limited levels of the phenomenon.
This conclusion is very similar to the conclusion
reached by Rettberg (2009). Rettberg argued that
electronic literature constitutes a literary avantgarde, but an avant-garde that is not part of
any institutionalized mainstream. However, Rettberg's
work represents the analysis of an individual directly
involved in those efforts, and did not involve structured
data gathering to address the actions of literary
community members in the aggregate. The current
study takes the contrasting approach, gathering data
from respondents across the literary community to
begin developing a larger picture of how information
technology is influencing contemporary American
literary writing. The size and type of the sample used in
this study should help resolve any ambiguities raised
in the previous studies.

Browsing Highly Interconnected
Humanities Databases Through
Multi-Result Faceted Browsers
Pasin, Michele

michele.pasin@kcl.ac.uk
Department of Digital Humanities, Kingʼs College,
London, UK

Faceted browsing is a recent paradigm in search
interfaces that allows users with little familiarity of
a subject domain to quickly explore the contents
of databases or other structured data sources. The
underlying principle of this approach can be traced
back to the work of Indian librarian S.R. Ranganathan,
who, in contrast with traditional top-down, taxonomical
approaches to subject classification, in 1933
developed a method for organizing subjects in a
bottom-up and non-hierarchical fashion. According to
this model, a classification system can be created by
combining together subject descriptors chosen from a
number of non-exclusive and non-hierarchical facets
– e.g., in the context of classifying books, these can
be genre, date or author. This method supports the
generation of a flexible system that better represents
the multitude of perspectives we could use to represent
knowledge (Broughton, 2004).
As a result of the adoption of these ideas in
computer science, researchers have been creating
search interfaces that allow the exploration of digital
resources through the manipulation of filters describing
important features of a subject domain (Broughton
2002). A well-known pioneer in this area is Marti
Hearst with her work on the Flamenco faceted browser
(Hearst, 2002), followed by a number of similar
approaches that, in general, aimed at creating more
compelling and easy-to-use user interfaces (Hearst,
2008) (Capra, 2007) or at providing software packages
that can work with different types of data sources;
these may vary from manually editable JSON files
(Huynh, 2007) to databases (Stuckenschmidt, 2004)
and RDF triplestores (Oren, 2006). A number of
projects have also proven the usefulness of this type
of interfaces to the aim of facilitating the navigation
of large repositories of humanities data, such as
artwork images (Hildebrand, 2006), music resources
(Bretherton, 2009) or multi-genre collections (McGann,
2007).

The success of faceted interfaces can be related to the
fact that they implement a schema-less approach to
classification, that is to say, they make available to the
user a number of co-existing search dimensions that
can be simultaneously used to browse and preview
the contents of a digital repository. Many are the
proven advantages of such an approach (Perugini,
2010): first, users are never asked to 'guess' the
right search terms, as it happens in classic keyword
search interfaces; second, inconclusive searches are
prevented; third, non-experts can easily 'get a feeling'
for the significance and meaning of the data available
just by looking at the available facets, thus increasing
their understanding of the domain. In conclusion, this
type of interfaces simplify enormously the exploration
of a digital repository, and, using the words of
Nowivskie, they make it easy to “explore lateral
relationships” to the point that they open “possibilities
for algorithmic serendipity in research” (Nowivskie,
2007).
An important feature that most of the existing faceted
browsers have in common is that the different facets
available equally concur to the selection of a single
result-type. For example, by manipulating variables
such as the color and the making of cars, we
can navigate a data-space of available cars; by
choosing filters representing information about genres,
publishers and years of publication we can easily
narrow down a result list of books; or, in the context
of a prosopographical database, by accumulating
descriptors about people's forenames, surnames, or
gender we would be able to refine our search for the
individuals mentioned in the database.
In our work, we intended to push the boundaries of
this approach by creating a faceted browsing engine
that, given the same set of selectable facets, can be
used to search for ‘ontologically distant’ entity types.
For example, in the context of a prosopographical
database, by manipulating the same group of filtering
options, we aimed at letting users search not just
for people, but also for factoids and sources (cf.
Figure 1). In doing so, we assumed that rich and
highly interconnected humanities databases call for
more powerful search mechanisms; such mechanisms
should be capable of revealing the intricacies of a
subject domain to the casual learner, and, at the
same time, of providing a higher level of 'algorithmic
serendipity' to the academic scholar. In other words,
we aimed at making more visible the large number
of search pathways a highly structured database can
make possible - as opposed to hiding this complexity
by providing a unique entry point to the wealth of
data available. This means that, as shown in fig. 1,
199

Digital Humanities 2011

by using facets typical of the 'people' result-type (such
as surname or gender) we would like to be able to
search for 'sources' or 'factoids'. Or, by choosing facets
typical of the 'sources' result-type (such as document
category or language) we may want to filter results
when searching for 'people'.
With this vision in mind we created DJFacet1,
a faceted browsing engine that lets users create
powerful, multi-result search interfaces. DJFacet is
written in Python and is based on Django, a
popular web application framework2 that facilitates
the development of database-driven websites by
providing functionalities that speed up the creation of
repetitive tasks. In particular, one key component of
this framework is the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM),
that is, a set of functions that provide programmers with
a level of abstraction between the database and the
application language; as a result, it is possible to invoke
complex database queries without having to write any
SQL code. This makes the whole application easier to
manage and more portable across different database
engines.
By building on the functionalities of Django ORM,
DJFacet provides a customizable and easy-to-use
environment for creating database-driven faceted
search applications. The underlying idea of DJFacet is
that since a data-structure had already been designed
and fine-tuned when the database was created, that
same structure could be used to define the search
dimensions of the faceted browser with little extra
work required. An instance of DJFacet can run just by
creating an initialization file in which we define which
are the available facets and what 'behaviour' they have
with respect to the database schema. The software
then calculates automatically all the remaining querypaths needed to show the results in the various
searches.
At the time of writing, we tested DJFacet's approach
with two humanities databases. The Paradox Of
Medieval Scotland project3 (POMS) investigates how
a recognizably modern Scottish identity was formed
during the period 1093-1286. Drawing on over
6000 contemporary charters, it provides biographical
information about all known people in Scotland during
that period. In this context we built a search interface
that features 29 facets, organized into 5 groups (cf.
figure 2). The result types are 3 (people, factoids and
sources).
The Early Modern London Theatres4 (EMLoT) project
provides its users with a major encyclopedic resource
on the early London stage, as well as a comprehensive

200

historiographical survey of the field. EMLoT identifies,
records and assesses transcriptions from primarysource materials relating to the early London stage,
as found in secondary-source print and manuscript
documents. In this case the faceted search interface
contains 24 facets, organized into 5 groups. The result
types are 7 (transcription records, primary sources,
secondary sources, events, people, troupes, venues).
By using DJFacet it was possible to allow the
formulation of queries that might not be immediately
obvious to the user. For example, in POMS it became
trivial to search for Charters mentioning transaction
events in which 'beneficiaries' of name 'William' acquire
something on the day of the 'Feast of St Patrick '.
Also, the search interface provided users with more
chances of coming across interesting connections in
the available materials. This was made possible by the
fact that the facets used in the search are ontologically
distant from the respective result-types.
However, despite the fact that this approach proved
to be, from the logical and computational point of
view, completely feasible, it also opened up a number
of research questions from the point of view of
the meaning of these multifaceted searches across
different results types. In other words, we realized that
often the accumulation of filters ontologically distant
from each other could be hardly translated by the
end user into real-world questions; analogously, the
opposite may happen, in so far as simple type of
searches may be impeded by the highly structured
architecture of a faceted browser.
In order to provide some answers to this issue
and lay the ground for a more scientific discussion
of the problem we are currently carrying out a
user evaluation study with humanities scholars. The
purpose of the experiment is to discover the degree
to which humanities scholars can make sense of the
search mechanisms provided by our faceted browser,
and, indirectly, of the complex data structures often
necessary for representing humanities subjects. We
will report on these findings at the conference, together
with a deeper analysis of the implications of using
multi-result faceted browsers in the context of complex
humanities datasets.

Civil War Washington: An
Experiment in Freedom,
Integration, and Constraint

Civil War Washington (CWW) is a thematic research
collection that strives to enable users to visualize,
analyze and interpret the physical, social, cultural,
and political transformation of Washington, D.C. The
development of Washington, D.C., during the Civil War
is pivotal in American history. When the Compensated
Emancipation Act went into effect on April 16, 1862,
Washington became the first emancipated city—and
the country's largest and most important magnet for
freed and runaway slaves. From that moment forward,
the city would lead the nation in the sometimes
tortuous route from slavery to freedom and from
an entrenched system of legal inequality to a new
commitment to equality for all. Our work on slavery,
race, and emancipation in Washington, D.C., is crucial
to our larger long-term study of the city in this time of
crisis. We are already studying Civil War Washington
from a medical perspective (the number of hospitals
jumped from three to nearly one hundred making it
a city of hospitals), from a military perspective (the
city was the prized objective of Southern military
strategy and in response the Union army made it
the most fortified city in the world), and in fact
from numerous other perspectives as well. With the
assistance of a collaborative research grant from the
National Endowment for the Humanities, our emphasis
in 2010-2013 is to study the history of race, slavery,
and emancipation in the city, a story of national
importance.
The transformation of the U.S. capital has received
surprisingly little sustained examination. One reason
for this, no doubt, is that developing a rich and
accurate understanding of the city's remaking requires
not only access to but also synthesis and analysis
of large and diverse sets of data, most of which

202

exist only in analogue form. Our project, for example,
draws on government reports, journalism, legal
documents, diaries, census records, correspondence,
city directories, poems, maps, and photographs. A
further (and we believe necessary) complication is
added by our desire to make a temporally-aware and
user-manipulable GIS a significant constituent of our
project, perhaps in some ways even its core.
The number of projects, both emergent and
established, that claim an interest in GIS and
place-based scholarship seems to grow daily. This
developing interest is reflected in an increasing
number of seminars and training opportunities focused
on GIS for the humanities, including at the University
of Victoria's Digital Humanities Summer Institute,
the Digital Humanities Observatory Summer School
in Dublin, and the NEH-funded Geospatial Institute
hosted by Scholars' Lab at the University of Virginia. In
addition, there is a growing body of work on the value of
spatial analysis in the humanities, and historians have
taken a leading role in theorizing and conceptualizing
the integration of GIS into humanities research, as well
as in advancing arguments informed by GIS-enabled
research.
In recent years, at conferences such as this, a fair
number of projects have been presented as models
for addressing the still-daunting set of obstacles to the
use of GIS for humanities projects.1 Our experience
on Civil War Washington for the past five years,
though, suggests that several important challenges
have not yet been adequately investigated (let alone
addressed). Our talk, then, is designed to be not a
celebration of goals achieved but a case study for
the consideration of several large issues that face
our project and others like it.) Whereas most projects
presented as models began with fairly well defined
sets of data,2 ours began with a research question to
which we want to apply as comprehensive a variety
of data as possible. Our goal is not the digitization of
materials for the sake of digitization but the exploration
of a complex set of questions about the transformation
of Washington, D.C. Further, our goal ultimately is
to produce both a scholarly argument of our own
and a resource that will enable our users to perform
original, and truly meaningful, research based on our
data and interfaces. Given these aims, on what basis
should one decide the best technologies and methods
for data capture, storage, and retrieval? We have
responded to these questions based in part on the
expertise of project members and the technologies
that are familiar to us and local support staff. This
strategy has the benefit of quicker development and
an ever-more-refined knowledge in specific tools and

Digital Humanities 2011

technologies. Too heavy a reliance on the technologies
and methods that one already knows, however, can
lead to overlooking a more appropriate approach or
set of approaches. 2) Given the fact that capture
and storage of geo-referenced textual data can be
accomplished in several different ways (e.g., through
wholly TEI-XML, through assigning atomistic textual
units to database fields, or through a combination
strategy that uses both XML and database), what
principles should guide the adoption of a particular
encoding strategy? What tools exist or are most easily
imaginable for making such data available for a wide
variety of research approaches? TEI began providing
for the georeferencing of textual data only with the
release of P5 in late 2007, and we believe that the
integration of textual and geospatial data remains an
underdeveloped area to which the DH community
should give greater thought. Surely it has potential
beyond its rather modest application in existing
projects. 3) How should a project deal with the catch-22
situation of wanting to develop and enable geospatial
and historical analysis using open source tools even
as the most adequate tools for the task, regrettably,
are proprietary and the use of these proprietary
tools is taught in leading DH institutions? In other
environments, work on open source GIS has emerged
as part of the larger open source and open access
movement. The Open Source Geospatial Foundation,
for example, is working to “promote the collaborative
development of open geospatial technologies and
data.”3 Humanities scholars, however, do not seem
to be involved in the organization. What is and
should be the role of humanities scholars in the
developer community for GIS software? Does the
existing open source GIS software originally conceived
of by organizations such as the Army Corps of
Engineers (Grass GIS) or NASA (MapServer) meet the
needs of humanities scholars? We have considered
these questions not merely in the realm of abstract
ideals, but as immediate and pressing concerns; we
wish to use our project's responses to them not
as recommendations but as opportunities for critical
reflection and discussion.

A Data Model for Visualising
Textuality – The Würzburg Saint
Matthew
Rehbein, Malte

1. Abstract
This short paper presents the ongoing work and
the considerations behind the project “Visualising
Textuality – New Interfaces to Historical Texts”.
The project, supported by the EU FP7 Marie
Curie Scheme, aims at implementing a “knowledge
environment” (Siemens et al) to explore and
understand better early medieval textual practices
and pre-scholastic Christian scholarship. The project
starts from a manuscript from the University Library
of Würzburg (M.p.th.f.61), dated back to the second
half of the 8th century AD and most likely of Irish
provenance. This is a parchment manuscript with 34
leaves containing a text of Matthew’s gospel along
with extensive interlinear glossing and 30 cedulae
(parchment slips) containing commentary material
bound between the pages (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1: Excerpt from M.p.th.f.61 with comments on parchment slips.

It is also an intriguing object of historical studies: its
numerous glosses (interlinear and marginal) as well
as commentaries (on parchment slips) allow insight
into practices of compilation and use of this manuscript
(cf. Fig. 1). However, it poses many challenges to
editors and researchers: different layers of writing
(strata) have been identified; the arrangement (miseen-page) of glosses and commentaries in relation to

204

the Gospel text and to each other conveys important
information but is not easy to follow; the “intertexts”
cross the logical segments of the text and the physical
boundaries and dimensions of the document pages;
the texts themselves, especially the commentaries,
have their own history of transmission; and they recite,
vary from and refer to other commentaries such as
Eusebius, Jerome or Isidor, who also refer to other
commentaries and biblical texts etc. Cahill summarizes
that the Würzburg Matthew is “a complicated jumble
and not a tidy bundle” and requires further research
(2002:25). His statement applies to all levels of
investigation: the physical (document), the logical
(texts and contexts) and the level of space and time
(cf. Fig. 2).

Fig. 2: Model illustration of the complex network of
relations based on the Würzburg glosses (not complete).

It is the aim of this research project to find adequate
means for representing such a complicated network
of information, for visualising these relations and
for allowing the researcher to navigate through this
data in form of a “knowledge environment”. The fact
that this all is a “complicated jumble” has to be
seriously taken into consideration. The data that is
outlined here consists of numerous combinations –
of semantic relations, chronological dependencies,
spatial transmissions, topological information – each
of which may carry an important detail for research.
What serves for the first time for an in-depth and
comprehensive research, has its risk in getting lost
in information. Thus, it seems to be crucial for the
scholar to focus his or her attention up on what (s)he
is interested in. Support for this needs to be provided
by the knowledge environment.
The project is in the first year of its three years
implementation plan. At the time of the DH conference
(June 2011), most of the textual work on the
manuscript shall be completed, so that preliminary

Digital Humanities 2011

considerations about the setup of the envisaged
knowledge environment and what is more important
about the underlying data model will be discussed
and presented. This data model is an abstraction of
document, text and context and encompasses entities
of different types (such as segments of texts, zones in
a document, time, space, scribes, sources, metadata)
and relations among them (such as “origins from”,
“uses”, “was written by”) as well the interface to
external data (such as the Patrologia latina database)
to link to text variants and contexts.

Toward a Demography of
Literary Forms: Building on
Moretti's Graphs
Riddell, Allen B.

allen.riddell@duke.edu
Duke University

Why do novelistic genres end? Why do we see gothic
and industrial novels, Bildungsromane and mysteries,
all disappear after periods of popularity during the 18th
and 19th centuries? How literary forms—novelistic
genres in particular—come and cease to be has long
been an area of inquiry, and the work of Franco Moretti
(2005) in Graphs, Maps, Trees has given the topic new
energy.
The years since the publication of “Graphs” in 2003
have seen the resources available for investigating
patterns in 19th century literary production expand
immeasurably. For example, scans of over 7,800
volumes of 19th century British novels are now
available from the University of Illinois-UrbanaChampaign’s collection alone. Those interested in
extending or challenging Moretti’s observation that
novelistic genres tend to arrive in “bursts” linked to
social generations—or, in general, in contributing to
Moretti’s proposed “sociology of literary form”—now
have access to a wealth of new data. Given the
continuing interest that Moretti’s work has generated
among students of the human, social, and natural
sciences, this represents an important opportunity.
My contribution explores further the prospects for a
“demography of literary forms,” building on Moretti’s
proposal for research at the intersection of literary
history and sociology.1 First, I consider opportunities
to improve Moretti’s original “generational model”
of cycles in literary forms, offering new methods
to remedy identified evidential gaps. For example,
Moretti’s periodizations of genres—e.g. Courtship
Novel, 1740-1820—have been criticized as too neatly
falling on certain “focal dates” such as years falling
at the end of a decade (Shalizi, 2006). I present new
evidence in support of this criticism and demonstrate
a method for making periodizations reproducible by
others. Being able to reproduce Moretti’s results will
hopefully make the research program itself more
open to experimentation and invite collaboration. My
method uses bibliographic databases to establish
the period during which the vast majority (~90%) of
206

the novels in a given genre were published. This
provides a reproducible periodization suited to an
inquiry into social history.2 I also briefly discuss the
application of classification algorithms from machine
learning to identify possibly overlooked genres in
Moretti’s dataset. The new method for periodization is
demonstrated in detail for two of the forty-four genres in
Moretti’s dataset, the silver fork and Newgate novels.3
Second, in order to offer an alternative to the
generational model, I argue for and attempt to
test the hypothesis that the observed clustering of
genre appearances and disappearances can also
be explained by positing a “carrying capacity,” an
upper limit on the number of established novelistic
genres able to be supported by writers, readers, and
publishers in any given year.
Finally, I explore the suggestion that generational
changes in “mental climate” might manifest themselves
not (only) in changes in novelistic genres, as
suggested by Moretti, but rather in topical changes
within novelistic genres. In studying a topic model
(Steyvers et al., 2007) of the 7,800 volumes in
UIUC’s 19th century novels collection, I observe some
evidence for topical trends cutting across multiple
genres. For example, starting in the mid-19th century
there is a proportional rise in a cluster of words
suggestive of farming and rural life.
Moretti’s work has been a touchstone for numerous
discussions connected to the digital humanities—
for example, the fate of “close reading”. Perhaps
more significant in the long-run is the interest
his work has gained from scholars in the social
and natural sciences, with examples ranging from
formal reviews like that of statistician Cosma Shalizi
(2006) to more informal commentary on quantitative
literary history from social scientists like Henry Farrell
(2010) and Andrew Gelman (2010). Finding scholars
outside of literary studies and literary history publicly
engaging with research is an important development.
Given the desirability of new models of research
in the humanities, Moretti’s program can claim a
interdisciplinary following that makes revisiting and
extending his work of particular significance.

1. Introduction
How were computers introduced to the public and
how did humanities issues figure in the introduction
of computing? The time has come in the digital
humanities to think historically about computing in
the humanities as Willard McCarty has pointed out
in Humanities Computing and other venues. This
paper describes a study of public representations of
computing in Canada using the Globe and Mail, our
major national newspaper. This paper restricts itself to
what we call the incunabular years when computing
was still a curiosity and business applications didn’t yet
dominate the public discourse.
References to digital computers in the Globe and Mail
start in 1950 with a report of the annual meeting in
London, England of Ferranti Ltd. This report describes
under the heading of “Instruments” the development of
a digital computer that was probably the predecessor
of the Ferranti Atlas which pioneers like Susan Hockey
worked on.
"The instrument department has a design team of
considerable strength working in conjunction with
Manchester University on the development of an
electronic digital computer." (Globe and Mail, Oct. 31,
1950, p. 21)

207

Digital Humanities 2011

From this first reference to digital computers buried in
a business report, interest in and then anxieties about
computers grow steadily through the 1950s and early
1960s until by 1964 the Globe runs a full page story
in “The Woman’s Globe and Mail” on “Will Computers
Replace the Working Girl?” by Michelle Landsberg
(Globe and Mail, May 21, 1964) that warns of the
effects of automation on women who do most of the
clerical work that can be automated. Computers go
from being objects of curiosity in research labs at
the University of Toronto with speculative utility to
instruments that are changing the nature of office work,
especially for women. It is this “incunabular” period that
interests us, partly because it is a period when the
academy is one of the major sites where computers are
being installed and because academics are explaining
computers to the broader community. This paper,
using these early stories about computers, will tease
out a history of early representations of computing in
Canada. Specifically we will:

Once gathered we coded the articles for content
analysis. The coding rubric was developed iteratively
as we read articles and developed hypotheses. For
example, during the coding we became interested in
gender and went back over the early stories to recode
materials. Below is an example of the codes applied:

2. Discuss the ways computers are presented to the
public in the first decade and a half. Who is
represented as having access to digital computers?
What tasks are they presented as suitable for?
3. Discuss how computing jobs like data-entry, training
and programming are gendered in the public
discourse of the Globe.
4. Discuss the first references to the installation
of computers at Universities and how these
installations were presented to the public.
5. How was research computing presented and
how were humanities applications of computing
presented?

2. Methodology
The Globe and Mail online archive, unabashedly
titled “Canada’s Heritage from 1844,” provides a fulltext historical database of articles, ads, editorials
and special features. In order to document the
early discourse around computers we searched and
collected all references to the word “computer”
for content analysis coding and reading. The first
reference we found dates back to 1897, though in this
case it is not a reference to digital computers, but
the computer as a type of job. The first reference to
digital computers dates from 1950 and the number of
references per year remains fairly low until the early
1960s when computing takes off as a subject of news,
advertising and opinion.

208

- Type of reference (i.e. news, classified ad, feature)
- Photos (i.e. were there photos and what do the
photos show)
- Category of Application (University, Science,
Military, Automation, Industry, Government, and Arts
and Humanities)
- Gender of Named People (male, female, both, none)
- Discourse like “Brain” (Is the computer described as
a giant “brain”)
- Types of computers mentioned in the references
where applicable

Close reading and content analysis led us to identify
and follow a number of themes running through
the stories in these incunabular years. For example,
related to the Ferranti mentioned in the first reference,
is a Canadian turn from being oriented towards
computing in the UK to being oriented towards
computing from the USA. This turn is obviously a much
larger issue for Canada after the war than just a change
in where computers are coming from, but you see the
turn in the articles from the 1950s. Bylines from London
dominate in the early 50s, but by the end of the 1950s
New York begins to be source of information about
computers outside of Canada. You can see the early
orientation towards the UK in titles like the 1955 article
“Britain Leads in Office Automation.” But, by 1961,
in a comprehensive pair of articles on the computer
industry, it is clear that US companies dominate. As
the author Hugh Munro puts it, “Ferranti is the only
company that designs and manufactures in Canada
– specializing in big installations – which means the
country is heavily dependent on the United States,
where the other companies are based, not only for
supplies but for technological advancement in the
computer field.” (Munro, “Surging Computer Industry
Confident It Has Only Begun”, December 6th, 1961, p.
23.)

4. Exclusionary Practices: Gender and
Computing
One theme that stands out in the early representations
of computing in the Globe is how women

Digital Humanities 2011

were excluded from computing. Advertisements for
programmers are in the “Help Wanted Male” section. It
isn’t until 1960 that a woman is named in a story and
then she is discussed as an exception. The exclusion
of women gets discussed explicitly in 1964 when
Michelle Landsberg writes the extraordinary feature
“Will Computers Replace the Working Girl?” mentioned
above (Globe and Mail, May 21, 1964). This feature
confronts the effects of automation on women who
happen to do most of the clerical work that is being
automated. In the full paper we will contrast the
exclusion with what we know of pioneers like Beatrice
Worsley who was one two staff hired initially by the
University of Toronto Computing Centre.

Computers and the Working Girl; Title, Illustration and Text

5. Computing in the University
The second story published about digital computers
in the Globe is much more substantial than the
Ferranti reference and it describes the first research
computer installed in Canada at the University of
Toronto. The story titled “Junior Electronic Brain Cost
$100,000” dates from 1951, was accompanied by two
photographs, and is about the UTEC Jr. computer
installed at the U of T’s Computing Centre. It is really
the first significant story about computing in the Globe,
which is significant. In the full paper we will go into
some detail about this first significant representation of
computing as it illustrates many of the other points we
want to make.

the first ads for computing courses at U of T and the
first reports of computers at other universities. By 1957
we see an article about computing in the arts and
humanities. This article, titled, “Strange Music Made By
an Electronic Brain” reports about a music composition
experiment.
"To the casual observer, the squeaks, squawks,
groans and hints of tunes were a harsh cacophony. To
Professor C. C. Gotlieb and his colleagues, the sounds
were the Iliac Suite, a string quartet composed by the
electronic brain at the University of Illinois. It was an
experiment in composition designed by Prof. Gottlieb
and his fellow-workers with the university’s electronic
brain to show that humans are not the only ones that
can compose music."
What stands out about this and subsequent stories is
that they are about the computer as an extraordinary
device best understood as an “electronic brain”
performing tasks that are human. The stories don’t
really report humanities applications differently from
scientific and engineering ones. Instead this research
brain is presented as answering questions and
completing tasks from all fields – it is a general purpose
inquiry engine that the U of T Computing Centre is
turning to questions and academic tasks from one
field to the next. The brain is curious as we are,
and the stories convey a sense of the discovery as
Gotlieb’s team crosses disciplines discovering new
uses for the computer. What remains to be seen (in
a future study) is how the public discourse matches
or reflects the evolving discourse within the academy
and especially in humanities computing circles. We
humanists, after all, are also reading the news; did we
come to computing influenced by news of its promise
or were we concerned about how it might affect our
work?

Much could be said about the U of T Computing Centre
and the birth of academic computing in Canada. Here
we will restrict ourselves to the way computing was
presented to the public as starting at the University of
Toronto. The U of T Computing Centre stayed in the
news for decades, along with its director, Dr. Gotlieb,
who was the most frequently mentioned expert of
the period. But academic computing is not just about
Gotlieb and research at his Centre. By 1955 we see

1. Introduction
Over the years, digital libraries and textual archives
have collected, described, and classified texts and
multimedia objects. These kinds of repositories are
effective in compiling, describing, and disseminating
the cultural heritage such as the artistic and literary
expressions. Also, many of them, following the
developments of Computational Linguistics, have
incorporated tools for textual analysis as part of their
end-user services. Nevertheless, these systems are
weak in terms of relationships. Of course, they are
configured in such way that it is possible to relate
the digital objects compiled; thus, for instance, it is
easy to retrieve a set of visual artefacts sharing the
same subject matter. However, these relationships
are based on the traditional criteria of classification
and description (metadata and keywords), without
any intention of exploring the nature or specific
characteristics of the relationships that the Art History
discipline’s phenomena maintain among them.
We should not overlook the intrinsic relationship
that exists among texts, concepts – or ideas –,
words and visual artefacts in the construction of arthistorical knowledge (Mitchell, 1994). As Heffernan
(2006) argues for the case of words and images, this
relationship should not taken as a simple reproduction
of art works by a set of words, but rather the
conjunction of visual artefacts and words generates
new knowledge. This is one of the reasons for which
we can contend that these relationships deserve to be
treated as a research object in themselves.

210

Therefore, our intention is to explore the potential
relationships that could be established among these
entities: texts, concepts, words, and visual artefacts
with the aim of investigating how these relationships
are able to produce new significant knowledge or are
able to open new understandings.

2. Religo
Religo is a system that enables the construction of
interpretations based on relationships. According to
the researcher’s needs and the art historian’s research
habits and procedures, the question of text and image
induces us to design a system to establish relations
between various kinds of objects (texts, images,
videos, etc.), to provide new possibilities for analysis
and research, which are offered only partly by the state
of the art.
Currently, in the most significant projects1 working on
texts and images – although with interesting and useful
features – some limitations can be found in terms of:
- functionalities: only tagging or object manipulation;
- usability: complex and without a user-friendly
interface;
- purpose: oriented to social participation (this
feature often does not reach the entire scholarly
community).
Taking into account this state of the art, Religo does not
reduce the relationship to the concept of pure tagging
or to the idea of simple connection between entities,
but treats it as basic element for interpretation and
analysis, making itself the subject of research in order
to create new knowledge.
Religo relates the domain entities creating two
logical levels: the expression one, consisting of
digital objects on which the interpretation can be
developed; and the semantic one, consisting of digital
concepts (the relationships between digital objects
and the predications on themselves) that allow the
interpretation to be built (Buzzetti, 2004)2.
This means that, when a digital concept is the subject
of interpretation, it is placed on the expression level,
becoming a digital object itself.
An example is the Michelangelo’s masterpiece The
Last Judgement, analysed and interpreted by the
Spanish author Francisco Pacheco in his 17th treatise
The Art of Painting (1649). In this case, The Last
Judgement would be the digital object, and the
interpretation given by Pacheco, the digital concept.
However, insofar as the Pacheco’s interpretation is

Digital Humanities 2011

also subject of interpretation and analysis by the
modern historiography, it in turn becomes a digital
object.
The entities of the domain can be submitted to a
number of general operations (such as selection of
parts, links, free tagging or metadata encoding, etc.)
and others more specific according to their particular
features (specific operations on texts and image).
In every operation the centrality of the relationship is
clear: from its creation, made easily by a simple drag
and drop of selected portions of objects, up to reach
the composition of documents as result of the different
entities relationship that themselves constitute the new
knowledge of the study process.
A more evident utility of this new use of relationships
can be seen in the search and navigation functions, for
example to improve the search capability because it
ensures a higher degree of precision and recall3.
As an example, searching for the word emblema,
Religo returns both entities containing emblema as
textual occurrence (W) and those where emblema
does not appear (NW) but which are related to W
(Figure 1). Thus, the relationship gives relevance and
importance to the entity NW, which otherwise, from a
purely textual standpoint, would go unnoticed or simply
would not exist.

As a more concrete example, let us consider the
following domain:
The Art of Painting by Pacheco discusses
Michelangelo and his works, including The Last
Judgement. It also treats other painters such as
Velázquez or Tiziano, other works such as The Final
Judgement painted by Pacheco himself, the portrait of
King Phillip II painted byTiziano, and other artists such
as Dolce, Paleotti, Lomazzo, or Céspedes.
Religo allows relationships to be created between
these objects:
[Pacheco] author of [The Art of Painting]
[Michelangelo] painter of [The Last Judgment]
[The Last Judgement by Michelangelo], [The Last
Judgement by Pacheco] described in [The Art of
Painting]
[Phillip II by Tiziano] mentioned in [The Art of
Painting]5
[The Last Judgement of Michelangelo] influences on
[The Last Judgement of Pacheco]
[The Last Judgement of Michelangelo] used as
example by [Dolce, Pacheco, Lomazzo, Céspedes]
[Dolce, Paleotti, Lomazzo, Céspedes] cited in [The Art
of Painting]
[The Last Judgement of Michelangelo] illustrates
concepts of [deviations of decoro, terribilità,
movements and affetti]
[The Last Judgement of Michelangelo] described with
terms [artificioso, espantoso, terrible, horribilidad,
feroz]
These relationships themselves become new entities
of the domain, forming an interconnected network and
producing the following new knowledge level:

Figure 14

Relationship also affects the display of the entities:
that is, in addition to the classical view as list, Religo
provides a view as graph, creating a network between
the various domain entities which on one hand allows
the reconstruction of interpretive reading by simply
moving the focus between digital objects, on the other
hand enables a contextualized vision of every digital
object. These features, typically used during the work
process, are also useful in order to share and exploit
the research results.

[Lomazzo] [Céspedes] cited by [Pacheco] to define
the concept of [painting]
At this level, we can see how the result specifies
the connection among the different theorists cited by
Pacheco and the concepts that he defines in The Art
of Painting until creating another richer level:
[The Last Judgement] used as example by [Pacheco,
Dolce] to illustrate idea of [deviations of decoro]
[The Last Judgement of Michelangelo] used as
example by [Pacheco, Lomazzo] to illustrate the
idea of [movements and affetti]

211

Digital Humanities 2011

[The Last Judgement of Michelangelo] used as
example by [Pacheco, Céspedes] to illustrate the
idea of [terribilità]
What we can deduce from this result is that, from
the second half of 16th century, The Last Judgement
by Michelangelo plays the role of universal reference
to illustrate or exemplify a wide range of aspects
concerning the visual arts, being used by each
author in a different way. The Art of Painting, as an
encyclopaedic treatise, brings together many of these
interpretations, which Pacheco unifies into a single
point of view.
The most interesting results arise when we use a
complete repository of works, images, and texts. For
example, if we consider a repository of Spanish 17th
treatises, as ATENEA Project6, we might find the
following types of relationships:
[The Last Judgement of Michelangelo] described
by [Pacheco, 1649] and [Carducho, 1634] only
mentioned by [Martínez, ca. 1675]
[The Last Judgement of Michelangelo] described by
[Pacheco] and [Carducho] with coinciding terms
[confusión, temor, horribilidad, terrible].

3. Conclusions and Future Developments
As an initial task, Religo is provided with all the typical
features to operate on texts and images in terms of
combination of interacting tools for example to describe
and catalogue visual artefacts, to analyse images, to
manipulate images, or to annotate images (whole or
partly).
Together with the standalone version, an online should
be allowed in order to ensure content sharing and
social tagging in expert contexts of usage.
Moreover, the system would be generalized for use in
other different domains and would have the capacity to
handle other types of entities such as audio and video.

Development of Digital Projects
as Learning Strategies. The
Desingcrea/Diseñoteca Project
Rodríguez, Nuria

nro@uma.es
University of Malaga (Spain)

into a web portal also dedicated to industrial
design (Desingcrea). The idea was that Desingcrea/
Diseñoteca would be developed progressively through
the collective work of students, who would be
responsible for the preparation of its material and
content, through tasks incorporated into the teaching
programme of certain subjects of the degree. Once
developed, the Desingcrea/Diseñoteca system would
work as an online resource available to all students,
who could use it as a tool for consultation, study and
debate.

In the last Digital Humanities conference in London
(July 2010), several of those present expressed
the need for educational strategies based on digital
projects. The reasons can be summarised as follows:
firstly, given the difficult sustainability of these types
of projects, the help of students in their development
could be a key factor in their upholding. Secondly,
participating in real digital projects could help these
students gain an array of essential competences in
the digital society in which they will develop their
professional work.

3. Desingcrea/Diseñoteca: Design and Structure

Bearing this in mind, the aim of this paper is to present
a case of educational innovation, financed by the
University of Malaga since 2006, which I believe can
respond to the concerns expressed in London.

Desingcrea/Diseñoteca focuses on the industrial
design, therefore the entire information published on
this website is around this subject matter. As well
as informative sections, created by the students,
such as directories, bibliographical indexes, etc., the
Desingcrea portal has resources common to web 2.0,
such as the publication of news and articles as blogs,
the possibility for users to evaluate the contents, RSS,
tag clouds and the capacity to link these contents
to other existing resources on the Network (text,
images, web pages, etc.). It is therefore possible to
create a real, open and global network about industrial
design, which students use as a personalised learning
environment. [Fig. 1 and 2].

2. The Desingcrea/Diseñoteca Project
The Desingcrea/Diseñoteca project was originally
created to redefine the practical aspect of certain
subjects within the degree of Technical Industrial
Design Engineering given in the Polytechnic Institute
of the University of Malaga.
Specifically, our aim was to develop collective learning
strategies that could lead to significant and relevant
training, involving the student in the development
of his/her own knowledge. In order to do this
we decided that the new possibilities of virtual
interaction brought about by the Information and
Communication Technologies, as proposed in the
Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) theory, social
participation web environments (2.0), combined with
the educational principles of Pedagogic Constructivism
(Mitchel Rescnick, 1996) and Conectivism (G.
Siemens, 2006), offered the perfect framework on
which to base this project.
Taking an objective based educational model as a
starting point, we decided that all these strategies
revolved around a common objective: the development
of an industrial design database, which we called
Diseñoteca, which in turn would be integrated

Desingcrea/Diseñotca is a web application developed
specifically by computer engineers from the University
of Malaga for this project1. Updates carried out
on the system aimed to transform an informational
system, based on the «database» philosophy, into a
learning community, based on the «social network»
or «2.0» theory, bringing together users interested in
industrial design, amongst them our students, who
were responsible for its dynamization.

information that enrich the description of the object.
Besides, in this way the collective participation in the
creation of contents and the exchange of ideas is
increased.
Likewise, students can assess these records using
tools common to the repositories of the social web. This
assessment will act as a co-evaluation, complementing
the final grade given by the teacher. [Fig. 3].

Fig. 2. Blogs written by students at Desingcrea website.

The Diseñoteca database, which is integrated into the
Desingcrea website, is also being developed through
the collective work of students. Industrial design
objects are registered in a structured manner within
Diseñoteca. It is made up of data records in which
participants describe and classify the design objects
according to a protocol of standards and metadata.
[Fig. 3]

Management and monitoring of students. Each teacher
is assigned a specific number of students to monitor.
A series of features have been installed on the system
so that students are monitored in the most complete
way possible. In this way it is possible for the teacher to
see the records that have been created and edited by
any student and consult his/her record history, seeing
the different actions and tasks that have been carried
out. This way the system not only shows us the amount
of time that the student has been connected to the
Internet, but also the tasks that he/she has actually
carried out and therefore if the student has really been
working. [Fig. 4].

Fig. 4. Display for the teacher profile with
the report of the student´s work and actions.
Fig. 3. Diseñoteca’ s record. Simple display
showing the assessment given by students.

In order to create this data register, the principal source
used was The Categories for the Description of works
of Art (CDWA), of the Getty Research Institute (1998),
which was updated in the work Cataloging Cultural
Objects (Baca, 2006), of American Library Association
Editions. The result is a more specific example of this
standard that we call Categories for the description of
industrial design objects (CDOID), and that will be the
object of a future publication.
The system offers students the possibility to discuss
the records of their classmates, contributing data and
214

Finally, given that one of the aims of Desingcrea/
Diseñoteca, as mentioned, is to work as an
information and meeting website for all those
interested in industrial design, a validation tool has
been incorporated into the system as a means
to guarantee the quality of the process. That is,
information introduced into Desingcrea/Diseñoteca is
not made public to users until it has been corrected and
validated by the teacher in charge.

the Learning of Students?

Cabero Almenara, J. (2007). Diseño y producción
de TIC para la formación: nuevas tecnologías de la
información y la comunicación. Barcelona: UOC.

According to results obtained since this project began
in 2006, I list the following aspects which could be
applied to any similar, digital based projects.

Fisher, D. L., KHINE, M. S. (2006). Contemporary
approaches to research on learning environments:
worldviews. New Jersey: World Scientific.

- The students have become familiar with work
concepts and systems common to the design
and execution of digital projects, offering them an
invaluable preparation in facing this type of project in
the future. For example, they have become familiar
with the use of metadata, and have become aware
of the need for their systematic and coherent use, an
idea that is not always sufficiently adopted amongst
humanities specialists.

Lévy, P. (1994). L'intelligence collective. Pour une
anthropologie du cyberespace. París: La Découverte.

- With regards to the pedagogic use of 2.0 tools,
the potential of blog type applications to encourage
critical thinking should be underlined. News and
articles published by students, as contents on the
Desingcrea portal, can be discussed and assessed
by their own classmates, favouring the exchange of
ideas and encouraging debate amongst them.
- The possibility of linking information published on
Desingcrea/Diseñoteca with other news, portals and
sites on the Network, helps students to familiarise
themselves with the idea of the Network as a
global data repository where knowledge is produced
through the significant connection of information
nodes.

An Ontological View of Canonical
Citations
Romanello, Matteo

matteo.romanello@kcl.ac.uk
Kings College London

Pasin, Michele

michele.pasin@kcl.ac.uk
Kings College London

Canonical citations are references to Classical (i.e.
Greek and Latin) texts that are expressed by scholars
by means of an abridged canonical format (Romanello
2008; Romanello 2007). They fulfil the function of
providing an abstract reference scheme for texts
(somehow similar to the function of geographical
coordinates to express references to places) since they
allow us to express references to them no matter what
particular text edition we are actually looking at. For
example, the reference to the twelfth book of Homer's
Iliad expressed as “Hom. Il. XII 1” can be resolved to
the text of the same passage as established in various
critical editions of that work, where “XII” and “1” are the
“coordinates” that allow us to locate that precise text
passage within all critical editions of Homer's Iliad.
Historically, canonical references are the result of an
effort – whose origins can be traced back to the
Renaissance (Martin 2003; Berra 2011) – made by
the scholarly community as a whole to provide a
precise, stable and shared way to refer to Classical
texts. Since the early stages of Humanities Computing
and Digital Humanities (Bolter 1993; Crane 1987;
McCarty 2005), canonical references were regarded
as the ideal candidate on which to experiment the
potentialities of hypertext: indeed they can be seen
as hyperlinks in potentia pointing a text from within
another. More recently (Crane et al. 2009) they were
considered as a discipline-specific kind of named
entities that Classics scholars should be provided with
tools to search for within their texts.
J.D. Bolter describes classical philology as “the art of
explicating an ancient text by exploring its relationships
to other specific texts and to the corpus of ancient
literature as a whole”. In such a discipline the act
of referring to texts – that J. Unsworth has listed
among the “scholarly primitives” (Unsworth 2000) –
becomes even more crucial than in other disciplines
since texts are the very research objects of classical
philology and references to them play a key role
216

in constructing argumentations.As N. Smith (2009)
has already pointed out, canonical citations reflect
an ontological view of texts in this specific domain
and specifically how classicists perceive ancient texts
as objects. In this paper we present the Humanities
Citation Ontology (HuCit)1, an ontology that aims at
characterising the semantics of citations as they are
normally conceived and used in humanistic disciplines.
We claim that the specification of such an ontology is
worthwhile for at least the following reasons:
1. it allows us to disentangle from an ontological
point of view the complex relationships between, for
instance, a canonical reference found in a journal
paper and the manuscripts and editions of the text
that we can access via that reference;
2. it allows us to define types of references and
alternative representations of the same reference:
this is an important step towards tools that allow
automatic formatting of such references according
to various styles (as it happens already for modern
bibliographic references with Zotero);
3. it provides us with a way to access the meaning
of canonical references beyond their surface
appearance, which might vary substantially as in the
case of “Hom. Od. I 1” and “α 1”, two canonical
references to the same passage but conforming
to different citation styles.From an initial analysis
of the relevant literature we concluded that none
of the existing ontologies actually model the deep
meaning of canonical references. An interesting
attempt to formalise citations by means of an
ontology is CITO (Shotton 2010) which however
looks exclusively at modern bibliographic references
and focuses in particular on citation types. As it
was observed already (Smith 2009; Mimno et al.
2005), the distinction made by FRBR (Functional
Requirements for Bibliographic Records) between
a work, its expressions and its manifestations can
be adapted to represent texts in the Classics
domain as well. In this paper we propose an initial
implementation of a canonical reference ontology
based on FRBRoo which is the result of a process
aimed at harmonising FRBR with the CIDOC
Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC-CRM) (Doerr
& LeBoeuf 2007).
A key aspect we have to face is to determine at
which ontological level of the cited object a canonical
reference is pointing to. A citation such as “Hom.
Od. I 1” is it referring to the abstract notion of
Odyssey (i.e. a work in the FRBR model) or to a
particular version (e.g. edition, translation, etc.) of
that work (i.e. a FRBR expression)? It might help to

Digital Humanities 2011

observe that this reference can be solved by a human
reader for example into the text of that passage in
French translation: therefore it is not being specified
at the expression level. The textual coordinates of the
citation, namely “first line of the first book”, expressed
by the string “I 1” clearly refer to a logical citation
scheme that applies already to the abstract notion of
Odyssey (i.e. a FRBR work). Thus we can say that
a canonical citation follows a given citation scheme
that characterises a particular literary text and might
differ from one to another. That citation scheme is
a conceptual object and is the result of the work of
scholars to guarantee the ability of citing literary texts.

In the framework of a Classics cyberinfrastructure
(Crane et al. 2009), such an ontology is meant to
support the interoperability of tools that are being
currently developed to extract (Romanello et al. 2009),
retrieve (Smith 2009) and solve (Ruddy & Rebillard
2009) canonical references.

To illustrate the notion of logical citation scheme
as opposed to a physical one let us examine a
single case, that is the Athenaeus' Deipnosophistae.
Scholars cite this work by means of canonical
references that follow a logical citation scheme derived
from a physical one (e.g. “Ath. Deipn. XV 694 e-f”). The
textual coordinates “694 e-f” refer to the pagination of
the edition of the text by Isaac Casaubon dated 1598,
and specifically to sections “e” to “f” of page 694 of that
edition. At first it seems a physical citation scheme. But
since all editions after Casaubon's provide the readers
with marginal numbers referring to that pagination it
became a logical citation scheme: indeed 694 does not
refer anymore to a physical page within more recent
editions such as Olson's.

Canonical citations have both form and content.
Different citations might differ by form but they can
still have the same content. The content of a citation
is the abstract reference of which that citation is an
expression. For example, a citation to the first line of
Homer's Iliad can be written in several ways according
to different citation styles. Nevertheless “Hom. Il. I 1”,
“Α 1” and “Homer, Iliad 1.1” are different expressions
of the same canonical reference to Homer's Iliad
(cited by book and then by line). Given all these
reasons, we propose to introduce - among the others
- the classes Citation, Reference and Citation_Style to
the "E28 Conceptual Object" branch of CIDOC-CRM
(we will discuss the details of this approach at the
conference, also in the light of most recent activities
to harmonise CIDOC and FRBR). Further work is then
required in order to extend this conceptual model so
that it can support more complex reasoning tasks, such
as translation mechanisms among different citation
schemes, or the automated extraction of citations from
non structured materials.
To sum up, in this paper we describe the
implementation of an ontology to model canonical
references that builds upon the solid conceptual
models already defined by CIDOC-CRM and FRBRoo.

Alma Cardell Curtin and
Jeremiah Curtin: the Translator’s
Wife's Stylistic Fingerprint
Rybicki, Jan

jkrybicki@gmail.com
Pedagogical University of Kraków, Poland

1. The Problem
Poland’s first literary Nobel Prize winner, Henryk
Sienkiewicz (1846-1916), owed his great if shortlived fame to the very numerous if very mediocre
translations by Jeremiah Curtin (1835-1906), diplomat,
ethnographer, polyglot. Born in a Catholic Irish family
in Wisconsin, he graduated from Harvard and was
posted as a secretary to the American mission in
St. Petersburg, Russia; his fluency in Russian made
him a popular figure among the local aristocracy.
Paradoxically, it might have contributed to his conflict
with Ambassador Clay and precipitated the end of
his diplomatic career (1869). Curtin switched to two
professions he continued till the end of his life: that
of the ethnographer (employed, for a time, by the
Smithsonian Institution) and of the literary translator.
In 1872, he met and promptly married Alma Cardell
(1847-1938), who soon abandoned her post as a
teacher in a Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home (for which her
studies at the Barre Academy had made her more
than qualified) to become her husband’s secretary,
amanuensis and editor; until her peripatetic husband’s
death, her life was to be led in hotels and boarding
houses around the globe – especially after the Curtins
stroke gold with Sienkiewicz’s international bestseller
Quo vadis (1896). Alma devoted much work to virtually
all publications signed by Jeremiah: his translations of
Sienkiewicz and of other Polish authors (Orzeszkowa,
Prus and Potocki); his translations from the Russian
(Gogol, Zagoskin’s and Alexy K. Tolstoy); and his
ethnographic studies on myths of Native Americans,
Ireland and Slavic peoples. She also published and
edited three books on Mongols after her husband’s
death.
Yet the story of Sienkiewicz’s translator is most
extensively told in Memoirs of Jeremiah Curtin (1940),
published after the death of Alma Cardell Curtin.
Although written in first-person narrative, they have
been since proven to be the work of the wife.
Michael Jacek Miko? has shown that Curtin’s alleged

218

Digital Humanities 2011

memoirs are in fact a compilation of “somewhat edited"
fragments of Alma’s diaries and letters to her family
(Miko? 1990). The same diaries (and not the Memoirs)
show the extent of Alma’s contribution to Jeremiah’s
translations: after a whole day of taking her husband’s
dictation, he would go to sleep while she would copy
and correct the day’s work (Miko? 1994). And although
she knew no Polish and, at most, but a little Russian,
it is not implausible to suspect that some traces of
the translator’s wife’s hand might have been left on
Sienkiewicz’s fiction in English. In the most radical
hypothesis by Cheryl L. Collins, Alma, “held hostage
by Jeremiah’s almost pathological restlessness," could
have been “his full partner" in his literary work (Collins
2008).

The analysis included all original works by Curtin
(12 extensive studies) and a great majority of his
translations (21 novels or long novellas).
Figure 1. shows the patterns of similarity and difference
of word frequencies in all texts studied. The bootstrap
consensus tree neatly divides Curtin’s oeuvre into
two discrete groups: the upper branches are his
translations while his Memoirs and his ethnography
lie below. Yet the Memoirs are placed away from his
ethnographic studies; also, what has been proven by
Miko? to be Alma’s work, lies close to two of Jeremiah’s
books on the Mongols, published by Alma after his
death.

This presents a nice authorship attribution problem.
All that could have been done in this respect with
traditional methods has been done by Miko?; the rest is
the attributor’s nightmare, as all work published under
Curtin’s name has been preserved in manuscripts in
Alma’s hand alone. And while traces of the style of the
Memoirs could perhaps be found in Alma’s editions of
Jeremiah’s ethnographic works, it is highly uncertain if
similar traces can at all be found in his translations.

2. The Method
All hope there is lies in non-traditional methods
of authorship attribution, developed at least since
the seminal Inference and Disputed Authorship: the
Federalist (Mosteller, Wallace 1964) and proven to
be helpful in plagiarism detection (although Alma’s
is plagiarism a rebours). This study applies Cluster
Analysis to normalized word frequencies in texts;
as shown by (to name but a few) Burrows (1987,
2002), Hoover (2004, 2004a) or Daren-Oskam (2007),
this is one of the most precise methods of “stylistic
dactyloscopy." A script by Maciej Eder, written for
the R statistical environment, converts the electronic
texts to produce complete most-frequent-word (MFW)
frequency lists, calculates their z-scores in each text
according to the Burrows Delta procedure (Burrows
2002); selects words for analysis from various
frequency ranges; performs additional procedures
for better accuracy (Hoover’s culling and pronoun
deletion); compares the results for individual texts;
produces Cluster Analysis tree diagrams that show the
distances between the texts; and, finally, combines the
tree diagrams made for various parameters (number of
words, degree of culling) in a bootstrap consensus tree
(Dunn et al. 2005, quoted in Baayen 2008: 143-147).

Figure 1. Consensus tree for all texts

The length of the word list used in this study (all the
way to the 5000th most frequent word in the corpus)
can raise doubts as to the validity, in this context, of the
term stylistic similarity: after all, words so far down the
frequency-ordered word list are often quite meaningful
and might reflect differences of content as well as of
style. Any chance of finding traces of the translator’s
wife’s hand in the translations as well as in the Memoirs
has to rely on somewhat shorter lists (tentatively, from
10 to 150) from the top of the frequency-ordered
most-frequent-word list; dominated as it is by functions
words and aided by a 100% culling rate (which limits
the analysis to words that appear in all texts studied)
and personal pronoun deletion, it might help purge
any impact of the texts’ content to try to bring, say, a
book on Irish myths and a translation of Sienkiewicz’s
historical romance, to a common stylistic, or perhaps
simply lexical, denominator.

219

Digital Humanities 2011

The new result is presented in Figure 2. The texts
attributed to Mrs Curtin either by Miko? or by Figure
1. are still immediate neighbours; more interestingly,
the Memoirs (and the two “Mongol" works) now grow
on the same branch with two translations: Lillian Morris
and For Bread.

in America, 1876-1879) and both feature a strong
female protagonist. If it ever made sense for Curtin
to give his wife a somewhat freer hand at shaping
the final version of the English version of this or that
Sienkiewicz text, it would have been on the occasion
of these two stories. After all, during the work on
Lillian Morris and For Bread in the Irish summer of
1893, Jeremiah was busy, struggling with several other
projects at the same time: he was collecting material
for one of his Irish mythologies, translating a couple
of other short works Sienkiewicz, and writing a lengthy
“Translator’s Preface’ to the Polish writer’s another
historical romance, Pan Michael.

3. Conclusions
So far, attempts at finding stylistic traces
of the translator or the editor have been
only partially successful. Word-frequency-based
stylometric methods have shown that they are better at
attributing the author of the original than the translator
(Rybicki 2009, 2010; Rybicki, Eder 2010), or that Henry
James’s switch from writing to dictation left no stylistic
trace (Hoover 2010).
This time, however, it is possible that the translator’s
wife has left her mark. First, Miko?’s attribution of the
Memoirs of Jeremiah Curtin is visible in the consensus
tree diagrams; second, the diagrams seem to validate
the suspicions of Mrs Curtin’s significant contribution
to The Mongols: A History and The Mongols in Russia.
Even more importantly, the most frequent words
in two of the Sienkiewicz translations seem to
exhibit a greater affinity to the Memoirs. It is
hardly a coincidence that the two short stories
depart from Sienkiewicz’s usual male- and Polanddominated writing. Indeed, Lillian Morris and For
Bread are two of Sienkiewicz’s so-called “American
stories" (written during or immediately after his stay

Evaluating Digital Scholarship:
A Case Study in the Field of
Literature

Evaluating and receiving credit for digital scholarship
within traditional disciplinary areas in the humanities
has been a concern much discussed, not only within
the digital humanities community, but at think tanks on
the future of scholarly publishing, within institutions, at
professional associations in the various disciplines of
the humanities, and in journal and newspaper articles.1
Over the past few years The Modern Language
Association has taken the lead in encouraging the
recognition of digital scholarship in promotion and
tenure cases. Its 2006 Report of the MLA Task
Force on Evaluating Scholarship for Tenure and
Promotion (http://www.mla.org/tenure_promotio
n) offered unequivocal support of digital scholarship.
Among its recommendations are the following: "The
profession as a whole should develop a more
capacious conception of scholarship by rethinking the
dominance of the monograph, promoting the scholarly
essay, establishing multiple pathways to tenure, and
using scholarly portfolios . . . .[and] departments
and institutions should recognize the legitimacy of
scholarship produced in new media, whether by
individuals or in collaboration, and create procedures
for evaluating these forms of scholarship.2"
This report and others (see "Our Cultural
Commonwealth: The report of the American Council of
Learned Societies Commission on Cyberinfrastructure
for the Humanities and Social Sciences" etc.) make
it clear that the Humanities must broaden traditional
definitions of scholarship and reconceptualize its
methods of evaluation. But it still falls to us in the digital
humanities to articulate the scholarly content and value
of our work and to propose explicit procedures for
effectively evaluating it.

221

Digital Humanities 2011

In 2008 the MLA’s Committee on Information
Technology released an Evaluation Wiki3 (based on
the work of Geoffrey Rockwell who served as a
member of the Committee from 2005-08) that provides
a framework for departments to evaluate this new
scholarship. As a result of this work, the authors of
this paper led a workshop in evaluating digital work for
tenure and promotion at the 2009 MLA convention in
Philadelphia. The workshop was designed to provide
both a framework from within which digital scholarship
could be evaluated, as well as a forum for the authors
to evaluate just how difficult it was for non-specialists to
come to terms this new work. With this in mind, several
themes were addressed in the workshop design:
1. The
impediments
involved
in
evaluating
digital scholarship, particularly in terms of
interdisciplinarity, authority, and use of standards;
2. Issues of disciplinarity: digital scholarship does not
fit comfortably into the what is currently valued in the
profession;
3. The absence of expertise at the departmental level
in evaluating digital scholarship handicaps both the
evaluators and the candidates;
4. The intellectual stakes of such work;
5. The value and credit accorded to interdisciplinary,
multi-institutional, collaborative work.
In the field of literary studies the gold standard
for tenure and promotion is the publication of the
monograph. Editorial scholarship -- textual criticism,
book history, scholarly editing, the sociology and
bibliography of texts --particularly in North America,
has been consistently devalued since the rise of literary
theory. That the digital is conducive to the kinds of
projects that have been denigrated by the academy
(certainly since new literary criticism), including
pedagogy, public humanities, and the creation of
scholarly editions, has made the argument for including
this work in tenure and promotion cases all the more
difficult. These aforementioned themes and questions
were meant to engage the group in questioning such
values.
The workshop was structured around case studies
based on the experiences of individuals in the field.
In some instances the case studies were anonymized
(as several of the workshop leaders created studies
based on their own scholarship), others were not (as
when it was clear who the author was from the online
scholarship under discussion).
Attendees were seated at tables of eight and for each
of three rounds had two case studies to choose from.
222

The first round of case studies were what might term
fairly traditional digital scholarly editions. This type
of digital scholarship was chosen because it most
resembled analogue scholarship. Nevertheless, when
we opened the conversation up for discussion, the
opening remark by a Departmental Chair questioned
that the edition under discussion should be counted
towards scholarship at all, as in her opinion, the
creation of scholarly editions fit squarely into the
category of service. This became a recurring theme
of the workshop: individuals who did not understand
the theoretical and technical imperatives behind the
scholarship consistently categorized the work as
service. It became clear that the production of editions,
whether distributed in analogue or digital form, were
not viewed as scholarship on par with critical theory.
Moreover, when the authors of case studies explained
the theoretical methodology implicit in their research
in terms of the technologies used, non-technical
participants consistently complained that the authors
were engaging in techno-speak jargon. Participants
also complained that the work was undertheorized:
however, when it was pointed out that theories
common to digital scholarship (for example, the
limitations of particular metadata schemes, issues
arising from the hierarchical nature of XML, or the
impediments to using a standard such as TEI for
genetic editing) were evoked and challenged, these
participants felt that it was not sufficient to rely on
theoretical perspectives not normative to the discipline
of literature (i.e. coding was not satisfactory as a basis
for the field).
Subsequent case studies teased out issues of the
implications of, in effect, outsourcing the evaluation
of scholarship to (scholarly) presses and journals, the
vast majority of which have not developed an economic
model for publishing digital scholarship. Discussions
circled around alternative models of validating digital
scholarship, focusing on the work, for example, of
NINES. Indeed, the success of the NINES model was
so apparent in these discussions that NINES has
committed its next two Summer Institutes (generously
funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities)
to evaluating digital scholarship.
Although the writing is on the wall that our field
must change to encompass new scholarship and
new scholarly forms as engendered by the new
technologies, the impediments to evaluating this
scholarship by non-specialists are paramount. The
digital archive may have been the first form to
challenge the primacy of print scholarship, but new
forms of scholarship are emerging that will even more
radically challenge the status quo.

Digital Humanities 2011

It is clear from the research carried out by the authors
in the preparation and delivery of this workshop, the
creation of the CIT Guidelines, and the development
of the NINES Summer Institutes, that it is imperative
for the Digital Humanities community to take a more
proactive role in supporting departments as they are
increasingly called upon to evaluate digital scholarship.
This burden cannot continue to be borne solely by
each individual candidate, as is currently the norm.
The overriding question for these activities must be
how do we provide a framework so that evaluators can
evaluate the research within the technological context
within which the scholarship is undertaken.

The Cairo Genizah is a collection of about
250,000 manuscript-fragments of mainly Jewish texts
discovered in the late 19th century. Most of the
fragments were written between the 10th and the
14th centuries. Today, the fragments are spread out
in libraries and private collections worldwide. The
Friedberg Genizah Project (www.genizah.org) is in the
midst of a multi-year process of digitally photographing
all of the extant fragments. As of March 2011, the
virtual library of the project holds over 250,000 digital
images, and 200,000 additional images are expected
to be integrated over the next few years. Unfortunately,
this huge collection is far from being entirely cataloged,
despite the ongoing effort to document and catalog
all extant fragments. Moreover, the existing catalogs
differ greatly in the amount and type of the data they
present. Many of them record briefly the content of
the fragment, without any information regarding its
physical attributes.
We present a system for collecting all catalog data
that can be extracted automatically from the fragment’s
image, mainly: the exact dimensions of the fragment;
224

number of columns; number of lines; size of the
margins; the fragment’s physical status (torn vertically,
horizontally, missing corners); and several additional
features. Our system differentiates between bifolios
and single pages, and in the first case collects the
above data for each page separately. Besides the
above attributes, which are expected to be found in
every modern catalog, the system extracts some finer
data that may be relevant to paleographic studies, such
as density of lines (line height, inter-line space) and
density of characters (number of characters in a fixed
unit of length).
In addition to the detailed physical description of a
single fragment, the huge database generated by the
system serves for supporting identification of “join”
candidates in the Cairo Genizah. A join is a set of
manuscript-fragments that originate from the same
original codex, but are scattered today under different
shelfmarks, possibly in several different libraries. In
a previous work, we described a system for the
automatic identification of joins by ascertaining the
degree of handwriting similarity between pairs of
fragments. By querying the database and applying
some basic rules for a good match, taking into account
the completeness or incompleteness of the fragments,
we can significantly improve on the quality of the
results obtained by just analyzing the handwriting
similarity.
Another aspect introduced in this paper is the proper
conditions for taking digital images of manuscripts that
are necessary for achieving this kind of results. We
argue that, today, the function of such digital imaging
is not only conservation and accessibility, but these
images should be considered as potential inputs to
image-processing algorithms and processes, and the
computer should be therefore taken into account as
one of the “clients” of the images. Hence, appropriate
conditions should be considered in advance when
digitizing manuscripts. Among these conditions we
mention the following:
- Choosing
the
optimal
background
for
foreground-background
separation.
The
background color should contrast, not only with the
color of the fragment material, (vellum or paper),
which is some hue of light brown, but also with
the color of the ink, usually dark brown or black.
Otherwise, text will be erroneously recognized as
part of the background, and characters will be
interpreted as holes in the fragment. The common
practice in some libraries to digitize manuscripts
on white, brown or black background should be
considered therefore as an imperfect one, because
these colors do not contrast well with the manuscript

Digital Humanities 2011

and the ink colors. Our study shows that the best
contrast for these colors is provided by a blue
background. Indeed, when we started digitizing
the huge Genizah collection at the Cambridge
University Library, we used blue as the standard
background color for all images and the same
practice was followed in the digitization of the
British Library Genizah collection. Note that since
with such contrasting colors the computer can very
effectively differentiate between the fragment and its
background, it is possible to automatically change
the color background to any color desired by the
user.
- Avoiding the use of clips, weight bags, notes,
etc. Every significant element in the image should
be easily identified and recognized by the computer,
and the best segmentation is achieved by color
separation. On the other hand, when there is a need
for use of extra elements with no significance to
appear, such as elements to hold the fragment or
keep it flat, we recommend that they be of the same
color as that of the background. Notes (such as
shelfmark numbers) should be of a fixed size and
shape, with some apparent icon on them, so as to
enable the software to identify them easily.

- Use of a ruler in the image. Placing a ruler in
the image enables the software to automatically
determine the exact dpi of the image, and thus
assess the various measures in some recognized
unit, such as cms or inches. This practice is crucial
especially when different images are taken with
different lenses or when the camera is not fixed in
the same position throughout the entire process. The
ruler should be distinctive from the fragment; hence
a wooden brown ruler or a see-through plastic one
will not make a good choice.
Unfortunately, when such aspects are neglected,
the application of computerized methods as
described above and harvesting their results become
unnecessarily difficult, and the quality of obtained
results is adversely affected.

of Digital Humanities, 2010). Further, the Digital
Humanities Summer Institute at the University of
Victoria has had participants from every continent,
except the Antarctic. Finally, the Text Encoding
Initiative Consortium has members and users from
around the world, with a growing number of projects
based in Asia (Siemens, 2008c). These collaborations
are possible given the advances in computers and
telecommunications. The recruitment of the right
person is no longer limited by geography (Cramton et
al., 2005).
However, these types of teams encounter the general
challenges associated with collaborative work, but also
with more specific ones relating to the geographical
distribution of members. Despite this increasing use
of research teams, protocols to prepare individual
researchers to work as part of a team, particularly
within those groups which cross language, culture,
and country lines, are not widely developed. Our
work is designed to identify effective work patterns
and intra-team relationships and describe the support
and research preparation that is required to develop
international research collaborations. The results will
enable those who work in such teams to recognize
those factors that tend to predispose them to success,
and perhaps more importantly, to avoid those that may
lead to problematic interactions, and thus make the
project less successful than it might have otherwise
been.

2. Context
1. Introduction
Interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary projects are
becoming an important part of academic life.
Research questions are becoming more complex
and sophisticated, requiring a team approach to
address (Newell et al., 2000, Hara et al., 2003).
At the same time, funding agencies are also
encouraging these types of projects through their
granting programs. One result of this increased level
of research collaboration is that teams have members
located at other institutions, whether nationally or
internationally. Digital Humanities as a community
is becoming increasingly international in focus. For
example, the Digging into Data Challenge was
jointly sponsored by Canada’s Social Sciences and
Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), the British
Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and the
American National Endowment for the Humanities
(NEH) and National Science Foundation (NSF) and
required each research team to have membership
from at least two of the participating countries (Office
226

While there is a growing knowledge base of the
benefits and challenges inherent in academic research
teams (See, for example: Bracken et al., 2006, Choi
et al., 2007, Fiore, 2008, Kraut et al., 1987), little
knowledge exists about the ways in which teams
with memberships across universities and disciplines
work together (Garland et al., 2006), much less about
teams with members from multiple country, culture and
language groups (Setlock et al., 2004, Shore et al.,
2005).
At a practical level, geography presents relatively
simple challenges. As time zones increase, the
flexibility in scheduling meetings decreases while the
cost of face-to-face interactions increases. Technology
may not always be capable of overcoming these
challenges. Distance between team members limits
the amount of interaction needed for creativity and
innovation (Cummings et al., 2005, Lawrence, 2006).
Further, some technologies and software may not be
available in some countries due to infrastructure gaps

Digital Humanities 2011

or government policy (for example, the Great Firewall
of China).
At a more complex level, differences in culture and
language may impact on various aspects of team
work such as structure, management, communication,
conflict expression and resolution, decision making,
and appropriate team behaviour and may be further
complicated by professional and academic cultural
differences (Dafoulas, 2002, Setlock et al., 2004,
Shachaf et al., 2007, Fry et al., 2007, Lee-Kelley et
al., 2008, Dekker et al., 2008). At a very basic level,
teams must decide a working language, a decision
that may be political in nature (Butler, 1998, Deepwell
et al., 2009, Bournois et al., 1998). And even with
a common language, members may find that they
must still translate terms. For example, institutions in
different countries define a research assistant (RA) in
a variety of ways. In Canada, an RA is generally a
graduate student who works on a research project on
a part-time basis while in the United Kingdom, an RA is
a post-doctoral fellow who is on a full-time contract for
a specified period of time. As a result, confusion can
occur among team members when they use common
terms in different ways.
Research suggests several factors that may minimize
the impact of the above challenges. First, education
and training may mitigate the impact of cultural
differences because team members may share
professional norms. University education is fairly
similar across countries (Dafoulas, 2002, Lee-Kelley
et al., 2008, Nason et al., 1998). Teams may
also find it beneficial to spend time in members’
cultures to create understanding of differences and
similarities (Nason et al., 1998, Bagshaw et al.,
2007). Finally, teams may also consider creating a
cultural profile, both by country and professional/
discipline culture (Dafoulas, 2002, Zakaria et al.,
2008). This profile can be combined with team
norms to express understandings of time, deadlines,
language, communication channels, conflict resolution
mechanisms, and other issues (Saunders et al., 2004).
However, more research is needed to understand
the supports and research preparation that is needed
to ensure effective collaborations in teams with
memberships from many countries, cultures, and
language groups.

3. Methodology
This paper is part of a larger project examining
research teams with multi-country, culture and
language representation, led by a team based in
Canada, United Kingdom and Germany (For more

details, see Siemens, 2010). The larger study uses a
combination of data collection methods including an
ethnomethodological approach with diary/log studies
of research teams in the midst of their collaboration
(Garfinkel, 1984) and semi-structured interviews with
individuals who have experiences in the types of teams
under investigation (Marshall et al., 1999). This paper
will report on the findings from the interviews.
Digital Humanities community will serve as an
exemplar case study population given the community’s
international focus and collaborative networks. To
achieve their objectives, and because of the variety
of skills and expertise that these projects require,
DH researchers must work collaboratively both
within their institutions and with others nationally
and internationally and often across disciplines.
Team members include humanities, social science
and computer science scholars, undergraduate and
graduate students, research assistants, computer
programmers and developers, librarians, and others.
At present, several research projects involving national
and international teams with funding ranging from
thousands to millions of dollars are already in place
with others in development. In addition, several DH
research centres have faculty and research staff drawn
from several countries, creating a mix of languages
and cultures.
This research project builds on earlier work on
DH research teams presented at previous digital
humanities conferences (Siemens, 2008a, Siemens,
2008b, Siemens et al., 2009a, Siemens et al., 2010).

4. Preliminary Findings
At the time of writing this proposal, interviews are being
conducted and data analysis completed.
The benefits to the Digital Humanities community will
be several. First, the study contributes to an explicit
description of the community’s work patterns and
relationships, particularly as the Digital Humanities
community continues to become international in focus
(Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, 2010,
Tei-C, 2010). This research demonstrates that much
of digital humanities research is accomplished within
interdisciplinary research teams, which are developing
tools and processes to facilitate this collaboration. One
particular issue highlighted in this research relates to
challenges experienced within teams with members
from various countries and cultures (Siemens et al.,
2009b). Second, it is designed to enable those who
work in such teams to recognise factors that tend
to predispose them to success, and perhaps more
importantly, to avoid those that may lead to problematic
227

Digital Humanities 2011

interactions, and thus make the project less successful
than it might otherwise have been.

Language resources are the bread and butter of
language documentation and linguistic investigation.
They include the primary objects of study such
as texts and recordings, the outputs of research
such as dictionaries and grammars, and the
enabling technologies such as software tools and
interchange standards. Increasingly, these resources
are maintained in digital form and distributed via the
web. However, searching on the web for language
resources is a hit-and-miss affair. One problem is that
many online resources are hidden behind interfaces to
databases with the result that only a fraction of these
resources are being indexed by search engines (He
and others 2007). Even when resources are exposed
to online search engines, they may not be discoverable
since they are described in ad hoc ways that prevent
searches from retrieving the desired results with high
recall or precision.
This paper describes work being done in the
context of the Open Language Archives Community
(OLAC) to develop a service that uses text mining
methods (Weiss and others 2005) to find language
resources located within the hidden web of institutional
repositories. It then uses the OLAC infrastructure
to expose them on the open web and make them
discoverable through precise search.

230

2. The OLAC Infrastructure
As set out in its mission statement, the Open Language
Archives Community1 is “an international partnership
of institutions and individuals who are creating a
worldwide virtual library of language resources by:
(i) developing consensus on best current practice for
the digital archiving of language resources, and (ii)
developing a network of interoperating repositories and
services for housing and accessing such resources.”
With respect to best practices, the community has
thus far focused on developing recommendations for
the metadata description of language resources2 so
that they can be discovered in search with high
precision and recall. The OLAC metadata format3 is
an extension of Dublin Core4—the dominant metadata
standard in the digital library and World Wide Web
communities (Bird and Simons 2004). To support the
need for precise search, the community has adopted
five specialized vocabularies5 for use in describing
resources: subject language, for identifying precisely
which language(s) a resource is “about” by using a
code from ISO 639;6 linguistic type, for classifying
the structure of a resource as primary text, lexicon,
or language description; linguistic field, for specifying
relevant subfields of linguistics; discourse type, for
indicating the linguistic genre of the material; and role,
for documenting the parts played by specific individuals
and institutions in creating a resource.
With respect to the network of interoperating
repositories, there are now more than 40 institutions
that are sharing their language resource metadata to
create a virtual digital library with over 90,000 holdings.
Participating archives publish their catalogs in the XML
format of an OLAC repository7 and these repositories
are “harvested” thrice daily by the OLAC aggregator
using the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) Protocol
for Metadata Harvesting8 (Simons and Bird 2003)—
another standard of the digital library community.

3. Mining for Hidden Language Resources
The Open Access movement9 has led to the
widespread uptake of self-archiving of research results
by university faculty and staff. It stands to reason that
among the millions of resources deposited into openaccess institutional repositories, there are thousands
of language resources. But these resources are not
typically accessible via general web search. This is
because they are hidden behind the search interfaces
of hundreds of repositories and they lack precise
identification as language resources. The question is,

Digital Humanities 2011

“Can we find the language resources in institutional
repositories and then make them easy for the language
resources community to discover?”
Our research addresses the problem by using text
mining techniques. We have begun by training a binary
classifier that identifies the likely language resources
within an institutional repository. We used MALLET,
the Machine Learning for Language Toolkit,10 to train
a maximum entropy classifier. For data to train the
classifier we needed a large collection of metadata
records covering the full range of human knowledge
that were already classified as to the nature of their
content. For this purpose we used the collection of
more than 9 million MARC catalog records from the
Library of Congress collection that was deposited into
the Internet Archive11 by the Scriblio project.12 We
used bag-of-words features extracted from the title and
subject headings of each MARC record. To label each
record as to whether it was a language resource or not,
we mapped the Library of Congress call number onto
the appropriate binary label based on a prior analysis
of the Library of Congress classification system. The
resulting set of 9 million training records was then given
to MALLET to train a binary classifier for language
resource identification.
The resulting classifier was applied to over 4 million
Dublin Core metadata records that were collected by
doing a complete harvest of nearly 700 institutional
repositories using the OAI Protocol for Metadata
Harvesting. The list of base URLs to harvest was found
by going to the University of Illinois OAI-PMH Data
Provider Registry13 and querying for all repositories
with the word “university” in their Identify response.
When applied to a metadata record, the classifier
returns a number between 0 and 1 representing the
probability that the resource is a language resource.
This probability was added as a new metadata element
to each harvested record. We then implemented an
extension to the OAI-PMH interface on our metadata
aggregator that allows us to request a ListRecords
response of a given size that is a random sample of the
records falling within a given probability range.
Figure 1 shows the result of evaluating the
performance of the classifier by means of manually
inspecting ten random samples of 100 records each
representing the full range of probabilities assigned
by the classifier. In the manual evaluation of the
classifier results, each record was assigned to one of
three categories: not a language resource, a resource
about a specific language, or a resource about human
language but no language in particular. Figure 1 plots
the number of specific language resources found in

each sample of 100 as the lower line; the upper
line adds the non-specific language resources. (Not
plotted are a sample of 500 records for .001 < p < .01
in which were found 0 specific language resources
and 4 non-specific resources, and a sample of 200
records for p < .001 in which 0 language resources
of either type were found.) The graph demonstrates
that the probabilities assigned by the classifier accord
well with the actual proportions discovered by manual
inspection, thus providing evidence for the validity
of the classifier. The notable deviation from the
expected trend is in the highest probability range.
Inspection of the records in question showed that the
majority of false positives were items from computer
science about programming languages and formal
language theory, leading us to hypothesize that the
training data from the Library of Congress catalog was
underrepresented in this area.

Figure 1: Evaluation of language resource classifier

Of the 4 million harvested records, only 52,000 indicate
a probability greater than .01 of being a language
resource. Multiplying the proportion of actual language
resources found within each probability range by the
total number of records falling within each range leads
to the estimate that there are approximately 8,000
specific language resources within the set of 4 million
harvested records.

4. Exposing the Once-Hidden Resources
The next step in our research is to apply a multiclass
classifier for language resource types to the metadata
records for the 52,000 candidate language resources,
as well as a named entity recognizer for language
names. The metadata records to which language
resource type and language identification can be
assigned with high probability will be enriched using
the OLAC metadata vocabularies. They will then be
entered into the combined OLAC catalog by creating a
new OLAC data provider for these language resources
that have been mined from institutional repositories.
The final paper will report on the results of these efforts
231

Digital Humanities 2011

at metadata enrichment and show how the results
are exposed to users through the two main OLAC
services that support language resource discovery: an
indexing service that provides a web page of relevant
resources for each of 7,670 distinct human languages
(as identified in the ISO 639-3 standard) and a faceted
search service that makes it easy to find resources of
interest by clicking on selected values of standardized
descriptors to successively refine the search.

Knowing and Doing:
Understanding the Digital
Humanities Curriculum
Spiro, Lisa

lisamspiro@gmail.com
Rice University

As the digital humanities have become more visible,
attracting attention both from publications such as
the
Chronicle of Higher Education and from
universities eager to develop emerging areas of
research and teaching, commentators have been
debating what qualifies as digital humanities and
whether the community is sufficiently inclusive. In
part, as Geoffrey Rockwell suggests, this debate
reflects digital humanities’ failure to provide multiple
paths to entry. In the past, many entered the
digital humanities by apprenticing with established
practitioners, but such opportunities are not available
to all (Rockwell 2010). New educational programs
such as the MA in Digital Humanities at University
College London and the proposed MA in Knowledge
and Networks at Duke are being put forward to
address these needs, joining established programs at
Kings College London, University of Alberta, and other
universities. As educational opportunities expand, the
digital humanities (DH) community should examine
how digital humanists are being trained (Hirsch
& Timney 2010). Based on this knowledge, the
community can create a more coordinated (though still
flexible) approach to the DH curriculum that reflects
its own commitment to openness, collaboration,
interdisciplinarity and experimentation. Education is
fundamental both to how the community comprehends
itself and how it brings in new members. As Melissa
Terras observes, curriculum “can be seen to define the
field in the way the publication record cannot,” serving
as a “hidden history” that reveals what knowledge
experts believe to be crucial and how that knowledge
is transmitted (Terras 2005, p.1). By examining digital
humanities education, we can participate in a concrete
conversation about how to make the field both
more inclusive and more targeted toward the core
knowledge and skills that digital humanists need.
In order to understand how the digital humanities
are taught at universities today, I will look at both
curriculum and courses.1 First, to get a broader
perspective on the digital humanities curriculum, I will
examine degree requirements and curriculum plans

232

Digital Humanities 2011

for digital humanities undergraduate, masters, and
Ph.D. programs. How are digital humanities degree
programs structured? What courses are deemed
necessary, and how are they sequenced? To what
extent are projects and/or internships required? How
do explicitly digital humanities programs compare
to more traditional programs that include a digital
humanities component? How are collaboration and
interdisciplinarity inculcated? Case studies of several
programs will be offered to elucidate different
approaches.
I am also analyzing a collection of over 200 DH syllabi2
for both graduate and undergraduate courses. These
syllabi represent a variety of approaches to digital
humanities, such as media studies, text encoding,
programming, and information visualization, and come
from a range of departments, including history, English,
digital humanities, library and information science, and
computer science. I am examining:
- What do these syllabi say about how knowledge
in the digital humanities is categorized and
conceptualized?
- What are the course goals? How is learning
assessed?
- How do these classes balance theory and practice?
- To what extent do the courses reflect “digital
pedagogy,” the thoughtful use of technology to foster
learning?
- To what extent are blogging, Twitter, or other forms
of networked communication part of the course?
- What are the most frequently assigned readings? Is
a DH “canon” emerging?
- What
are
some
typical—and
atypical—
assignments? To what extent are projects required?
How are projects structured and evaluated?
- How does the course reflect the practices and norms
of its departmental home? For example, how do
courses on digital history compare to those on digital
literary studies or digital media studies?
- How is humanistic as well as technical knowledge
woven into the course? What scholarly values do
these courses promote?
I plan to use a combination of manual and automated
methods to analyze the syllabi corpus. I am tagging the
syllabi using a set of custom keywords so that I can
sort them easily and see emerging patterns. I am also
compiling a linked bibliography of readings assigned in
DH courses. In addition, I will experiment with methods

such as topic modeling and word frequency analysis to
categorize the syllabi and extract key concepts.
Although my research is still underway, my initial
analysis of a subset of approximately 50 syllabi
suggests that:
- Digital humanities courses tend to use readings that
are freely available online, such as A Companion
to Digital Humanities and Digital History: A Guide
to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past
on the Web, as well as blog posts by authors such
as Dan Cohen and Bill Turkel. Given its apparent
interest in up-to-date, openly accessible information,
the community would benefit from openly sharing
educational resources such as syllabi, assignments,
exercises, and tutorials.
- While many digital humanities courses do focus
on text, as Melissa Terras noted in 2006 (Terras
2006), they have expanded to include topics such
as geospatial scholarship, multimedia design, and
information visualization.
- Many courses require students to create scholarly
digital projects, whether as individuals or in teams.
In a sense, this research updates Melissa Terras’
2005 study of the curriculum in humanities computing,
charting how the field has changed in the last five
years. I am returning to Terras’ question about whether
the digital humanities curriculum reflects the field’s
research agenda and whether DH has emerged as an
“ academic subject,” capable of standing on its own
(Terras 2005). I also hope my research helps to inform
the digital humanities curriculum going forward. While
the digital humanities curriculum should be nimble
enough to keep up with the pace of technological
change, diverse enough to encompass the variety of
approaches to “big tent” digital humanities, and flexible
enough to reflect the strengths of particular institutions,
the community can benefit from greater coordination
and sharing of educational resources to save labor,
spread ideas, and provide greater coherence across
programs. Of course, my analysis will focus on the
characteristics of current DH education programs
rather than on emerging areas of skill development, but
I hope to document innovative educational approaches
as well as points of consensus. Developing a DH
curriculum may make it easier for departments (and
individuals) to understand what they need to do to beef
up their digital humanities portfolio and how they can
specialize in particular areas of knowledge. Although
my study will not define such a curriculum (which
should be worked out by the community rather than an
individual), I hope that it will illustrate trends and gaps
in digital humanities education.

in 15th Century Middle Dutch
Historiography.

A scholar or student who wishes to engage in ‘nontraditional’ authorship attribution would be wise to
choose a test corpus that is as free as possible of
‘interfering’ features such as genre, external editing, or
a corpus that is stretched over a large number of years.
The higher the consistency throughout the corpus,
the larger the chance of a successful investigation of
authorship and/or stylistic features.
Medieval manuscripts are characterized by a much
greater amount of, what we could call, ‘interfering’
features. Scribes manually copied texts again and
again, not seldom altering the content and often
altering the orthography. Most original works have
been lost, just as much of the copied material. To add
even more difficulties, what we nowadays will easily
refer to as ‘original work’ is much less clear-cut in
the Middle Ages. Our modern notion of ‘copyright’ is
virtually unknown to medieval men and women and
for a long time the concept of auctoritas (author) was
primarily used in referral to classic writers such as
Aristotle and Augustine. Many of the medieval texts are
thus written anonymously.
The situation could be characterized as chaotic by
scholars used to relatively straightforward text corpora.
Before you can begin your quest for a medieval author,
you first have to find out what content is scribal related
and what can be attributed to the author. And just
when you think you are making some progress, you
find out that your ‘author’ has been merely compiling
source texts, who he (or she) is copying word for word.
A scholar addressing these texts should therefore
meticulously peal of the different layers of the text.
When confronted with these scenarios, it might not
sound that surprising that the number of studies
involving the use of computational techniques and
medieval texts is not that great. In recent years though,
some progress has been made (e.g. Van DalenOskam and Van Zundert 2007; Van Dalen-Oskam,

Digital Humanities 2011

Thaisen and Kestemont 2010). Most of all, these
studies show that it is possible – using computational
techniques such as Burrows’ Delta – to overcome
some of the difficulties in distinguishing for instance
scribal and authorial layers within a single text.

2. The Case
In this paper I will contribute to this evolving field of
research and discuss some possible methods that can
be used to differentiate these different layers within
medieval texts. Although the text corpus that I will be
using originated from fully tagged TEI/XML files, for this
purpose I will be using plain text files. This could be of
great interest to scholars who are not able or not willing
to spend large amounts of time, energy and skill in
preparing their texts. The texts are transcribed without
changing spelling to modern use (thus euen instead
of even and Iherusalem instead of Jherusalem), but
abbreviated words are expanded.
One of the more interesting aspects of this particular
text corpus is that it has been written by a single
person, whose name is recorded in one of his charters:
Hendrik Gerardsz. van Vianen, most likely secretary
of the Utrecht Land Commander of the Teutonic
Order. The Teutonic Order was one of the three major
military orders – beside the Knights Templars and
Hospitallers – that defended the Holy Church in the
Holy Land, the Iberian Peninsula and the Baltic region
and received goods and land all over Europe, including
the Low Countries. Hendrik van Vianen wrote at least
25 Middle Dutch charters containing land contracts
for the Teutonic Order between 1479 and 1491. He
also wrote a few Latin charters between 1489 and
1509 that are not included in this study. Furthermore,
he manually copied a manuscript containing a Dutch
version of the popular Sachsenspiegel that belonged
to two Land Commanders of the Teutonic Order in
Utrecht. Last but not least, he was responsible for
a chronicle on the history of the Teutonic Order,
known as the Croniken van der Duytscher Oirden or
Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik (Stapel and VollmannProfe 2010). Codicological evidence suggests that
the manuscript of his hand, now in Vienna, is an
autograph, although it is not sure whether parts of the
text existed before. Autographs are relatively rare in
a medieval context, a recent survey of Middle Dutch
manuscripts mentions barely more than a hundred
examples (Houthuys 2009).
As a result, we have the unique opportunity to study
a medieval text corpus – perhaps not as large as
the ones modern literary scholars work with, but still
substantial in medieval terms – of around 131.000

words that includes the work of a single person working
as manuscript scribe; writer of land charters; and
possible author of a history of his order.
Ever since the Croniken van der Duytscher Oirden
has been studied in a scholarly context, there have
been questions about the original composition. The
original Middle Dutch version of the chronicle consists
of a long prologue, a part that contains the deeds and
lives of the Grand Masters of the Order, alternated by
privileges granted by popes and emperors. It ends with
a history of the regional bailiwick of Utrecht and its
Land Commanders. Especially that last part is often
put aside as a later addition to the chronicle. It is an
interesting question, the more so since it has historical
significance in the sense that it has an influence on the
original function and aspiration of the text.

3. Methods
To examine the relationship between the different parts
of the text corpus we have collected, I employed
several methods, but for now, I would like to focus
on the use of the Delta Spreadsheets, freely made
available by David Hoover (Hoover 2009). Some
primary samples were selected from of the text corpus
using the Intelligent Archive (Craig, Whipp and Ralston
2010) to create word frequency lists: the combined
charters; the Sachsenspiegel; the table of contents of
the Croniken; its prologue; some of the privileges; three
parts of the Grand Masters’ part; and the bailiwick
chronicle. These were computed against 2000 word
pieces, overlapping and 500 words advancing. The
results are shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3.

Figure 1: Moving Delta, Charters

Figure 2: Moving Delta, Saxons’ Mirror

235

Digital Humanities 2011

Figure 3: Moving Delta, Croniken

What stands out is that in all three instances, the
primary samples of the table of contents and the
bailiwick chronicle (in light and dark blue) outperform
the other samples, especially if one leaves out the
samples in Figure 3 which perform off course very well
in their own consecutive areas.

4. Conclusion
What can be concluded from this observation? I think
the table of content and the bailiwick chronicle best
describe the personal writing style and orthography of
Hendrik van Vianen. In both the charters, the copied
Sachsenspiegel and the Croniken this layer is present,
and it raises the question if he indeed can be held
responsible for the bailiwick chronicle and the table of
contents. The table of contents is clearly written at a
later stage, added at the end of project, as is shown
by watermark evidence and the distribution of some
abbreviations and specific letter forms, quantified in
Figure 4 and 5 below.

Figure 5: Use or absence of
abbreviations in “ende” (Dutch for “and”).

Moreover, to what extent can Hendrik van Vianen still
be held responsible for the rest of the chronicle? Was
there an older exemplar of a chronicle available to him?
It is hard to say for certain. There is a good possibility
that he was not so much the – what we would now
call – author, but more a compiler for large parts of
the chronicle. The old source texts would then form
another layer within the text. Again, in the Middle Ages
it is not always possible (and even helpful) to make
a strict distinction between the two. An old-fashioned
approach to research the sources of the chronicles
and how these source-texts were implemented could
be a logical step further and will be one of the issues
addressed in the remainder of this project.

Reforming Digital Historical Peer
Review: Guidelines for Applying
Digital Historiography to the
Evaluative Process
Sternfeld, Joshua

jsternfeld@neh.gov
National Endowment for the Humanities, United
States of America

From teaching students how to vet online websites, to
formal peer review of digital publications, to evaluation
of scholarship for tenure review, the need for a
rigorous methodology to evaluate digital historical
representations has never been more apparent.
Sophisticated databases, digital libraries and archives,
and virtual reconstructions have collectively reshaped
engagement with the past that has challenged the
boundaries of traditional historical practices. University
professors encourage students to create mash-ups of
historical multimedia content to be posted as YouTube
documentaries. Museums employ mobile applications
enriched with augmented reality to draw visitors
further into an exhibition. Geospatial visualizations
and virtual architectural reconstructions bring the past
alive and challenge entrenched scholarly and popular
perceptions.
While attention and resources have (justifiably) been
focused on content creation and tool development, the
digital history community has, until recently, neglected
the development of a methodology that can evaluate
digital work while meeting the needs of this shifting
landscape. This has begun to change, as leading
scholars in digital history have taken up the clarion call
for reform of the peer review process. The perception
is that peer review has become outdated and stagnant,
promoting conservative scholarship while also failing
to exploit more dynamic means of communication
and commentary through social media and Web 2.0
technologies. Robert B. Townsend, in a American
Historical Association (AHA) blog posting proclaims,
“The challenge lies in developing new forms of
peer review better fitted to the online environment,
both before publication (in the development and
assessment stage) and after publication (as a means
of validating the value and quality of the work).”1 While
Townsend and others have highlighted the ills of the
current peer review system, they have yet to propose
a set of review guidelines or methodology that would
237

Digital Humanities 2011

bring together the interests and special knowledge of
multiple disciplines.
In my DH2010 presentation, “Thinking Archivally:
Selection, Search, and Reliability as a Framework for
a New Digital Historiography,” I proposed a framework
for evaluating digital historical representations called
digital historiography.2 Digital historiography is the
interdisciplinary assessment of digital historical
representations across diverse formats. It promotes
the rigorous and coherent use, recombination, and
presentation of historical information through digital
technologies. Digital historiography also accounts for
the increased reliance on complex information systems
to organize and represent historical data. The merging
of historiography with archival theory and new media
studies – along with numerous other fields such
as museum studies, information science, and other
humanities disciplines – ensures a comprehensive
examination of a representation.3
Three fundamental areas of archival theory were
raised in last year’s presentation as fundamental to
unlocking the trustworthiness and soundness of a
representation: content selection, search functionality,
and metadata. Through a series of illustrative
examples of historical representations it was shown
that these areas convey a representation’s historical
contextualization, where context is defined as the
formal and humanistic relationships among data and
resources. 4
Whereas last year’s paper focused on the theoretical
underpinning of digital historiography, this year’s
presentation will provide a programmatic framework
that scholars, archivists, librarians, curators, editors
and technical specialists may adapt and apply to
their own work. There are already a number of
promising developments underway in establishing a
set of guidelines and practices for digital humanities
evaluation, particularly in literature; nonetheless, a
similar approach in digital history has been lacking.5
This paper will provide a guide to evaluating digital
historical representations using a series of exploratory
questions. The following questions may provide an
entry point with which to kick-start an analysis. It should
be noted that these questions do not evoke clear-cut
responses, but rather require deeper interpretation of
the representation:
- Is
the
representation’s
historical
content
comprehensive or representative of the period/
event/issue in question?

238

- How do metadata schema and other descriptive
information shape the interpretative possibilities of
the representation?
- What capacity does the user have to repurpose
historical data for additional study? To what extent
does a user have sufficient contextual information
such as the content’s provenance to conduct such
repurposing?
- How does the user search or navigate within the
representation? In what ways does the interface
facilitate or prohibit advanced humanistic inquiry?
These questions apply a combination of historical and
archival understanding to address a representation’s
approach to selection, search, and metadata. At a
more general level, they suggest the need within digital
historiography to develop a peer review methodology
that examines the intersection of technological and
humanistic components of a representation.

2. A Three-Axis Framework for Peer Review
This paper will propose, based on the sample
questions above, three interlocking axes for a
peer review methodology: Historical Content, User
Experience, and Creator Intent. Critiques of digital
representations have all too often isolated one axis at
the expense of considering the others. Scientifically
driven user or human-computer interaction studies
may overlook the unquantifiable nuances of historical
contextualization. Similarly, an analysis of content
often neglects a representation’s user interface and
how it may affect information access. Perhaps
the most disregarded of the three areas is the
creator’s intent for constructing a digital historical
representation. In the fierce competition for funding
in the digital humanities, developers must be able to
justify their resource-intensive project, which raises
basic questions surrounding the representation’s
purpose and its contribution to historical scholarship or
programming.
For the purpose of demonstrating how to apply digital
historiography to peer review, a single digital historical
representation will be selected and the audience will
be guided through a brief, yet systematic evaluation.
In terms of historical content, we will consider
the representation’s engagement with relevant
scholarship. Although a digital representation’s format
may seem to belie traditional modes of historiography,
it will be argued that a representation’s demonstrated
recognition of historiographic trends is essential
for establishing whether it advances new areas
of historical understanding. Unlike a text-based
monograph, analysis of content depends on the

Digital Humanities 2011

capacity of the user to generate, not just consume,
plausible knowledge; therefore, peer review may focus
more on the questions that may be posed through a
representation rather than the construction of a single
argument.
In terms of user experience, this presentation will
focus on the question of access to historical content.
More than just a scientific optimization of keywords,
a reviewer must consider the user experience as
a culmination of design features, tool functionality,
and search capability. This raises issues regarding
the application of standards and best practices. The
selection of an appropriate metadata schema or
digitization standard will determine a representation’s
interoperability with other resources, which will in turn
influence historiographic assessment.
Finally, consideration of authorial intent, embedded
within elements such as a site’s introductory statement
or contextual essays, provides a third axis that can
anchor both a representation’s content and user
experience. The core question to be considered here
will be the representation’s intended or anticipated
audience. Digital technology has enhanced access
to historical knowledge for a wider public, which
has placed additional responsibility on the part of
the creator to consider how historical information is
selected, presented, and most importantly, handled by
diverse types of users.

3. The Benefits of Peer Review to Digital History
A peer review system that follows shared and accepted
standards and methodology may have significant
benefits for advancing digital historical scholarship
and digital humanities infrastructure in general.6
Representations may be assessed on the merits of
content and usability. In terms of scholarship, digital
historiography may liberate scholars and developers
to consider how to harness technologies in service of
historical inquiry when all too often the reverse seems
to hold true. The time for experimentation for its own
sake has passed, and we should begin to consider
how technology might contribute to more sustainable
development of innovative modes of scholarship.
This presentation is not intended to provide a fixed
method for peer review; rather it will encourage a
revival of humanities-driven interpretative analysis that
addresses central areas of scholarship, audience,
argument, and most importantly, inquiry. Peer review
must be contingent on the unique set of questions
related to a representation’s subject area and formal
qualities. Those in attendance will have the opportunity
to take away a set of general questions that they

may use to devise their own review criteria, or that
may stimulate further dialogue about the peer review
process. Perhaps most significantly, this presentation
will defend the need for collaborative, transparent
review that brings together subject and technical
specialists, which can spark evaluation of noteworthy
digital work that continues to elude mainstream
academic recognition.7

You Suck at Narrative:
Disciplinarity, Popular Culture,
and the Database Logic of
Photoshop
Stroupe, Craig

cstroupe@d.umn.edu
University of Minnesota Duluth

The series You Suck at Photoshop first appeared
as a three-and-a-half-minute hoax circulating on
the web in late 2007—a one-off Internet meme
satirizing home-made, how-to videos ubiquitous on
YouTube. Conceived and performed by advertising
professionals Troy Hitch and Matt Bledsoe, the
video featured an ironic, My-Last-Duchess-style
commentary by a fictitious computer geek Donny
Holye, who unintentionally reveals messy details of his
marital, legal, and emotional life while demonstrating
techniques of Photoshop. That same fall, in a special
issue of PMLA on “Remapping Genre,” some of the
leading voices in the emergent field of the digital
humanities discuss the database as a cultural form,
and debate the political, ideological, and practical
impact of databases on the work of the humanities,
and the practices of narrative in particular. The
varied contributions to “Remapping Genre” provide
a dramatic tableau of twenty-first-century academic
humanities confronting the database as a cultural
discourse, and speculating on whether it represents an
alien nemesis from the world of corporate capitalism,
the long-sought embodiment of implicit literary ideals,
or a value-neutral complement to narrative linearity.
This presentation argues that “Remapping Genre” and
You Suck at Photoshop not only share an historical
moment, but constitute a common critical effort to
understand and respond to the historical rise of
databases in cultural practice. Invoking this unlikely
affiliation might seem to announce another scholarly
incursion on the popular realm under the pirate flag
of Cultural Studies.  The relationship suggested here
between academic and popular cultures, however, is
less a territorial rivalry than a mutually transformational
dialogue.    And, in fact, this transformation is
well underway.    On one hand, as contributors to
“Remapping Genre” amply document, literary studies
is rapidly adopting frictionless, digital tools to perform
its daily work: from personal, bibliographic browser
plug-ins like Zotero, to online databases like The Walt

240

Digital Humanities 2011

Whitman Archive, to vast digitalization initiatives like
Google Books.  Less recognized, on the other hand,
is the degree to which popular, database-driven New
Media like Facebook, online games, and the web itself
are increasingly being constructed not only by the work
of programmers and designers, but by narratives that
users, players, and an emerging circle of professional
critics employ to shape, remember, and publicize their
experiences of virtual database environments.  Such
narratives reveal how the texture of language—the
friction of fiction—is an integral part of how databases
are culturally constructed and experienced, and the
extent to which that use of narrative language is
conditioned by a literary sensibility.
This talk will analyze clips from You Suck at
Photoshop—as well as background on the series’
circulation and presentation on the web—to examine
the interplay of narrative and database as textual and
cultural logics, as well as to suggest the historical
transformations that such an emergent dialogic is
producing in the relationship between the academic
humanities and popular culture. Like Donny Hoyle’s
conflicted relationship with Photoshop’s remorselessly
vast database of tools, the Digital Humanists featured
in “Remapping Genre” express ambivalent responses
to database-driven tools of their own academic trade,
and debate Lev Manovich’s claim that database and
narrative are “natural enemies…[c]ompeting for the
same territory of human culture, each claim[ing] an
exclusive right to make meaning out of the world” (225).
Ed Folsom’s and Kenneth Price’s digital project The
Walt Whitman Archive provides a common case in
point, serving to ground, historicize, and set in relief the
critical differences among these scholars, which echo
concerns and anxieties within the profession at large:
questions concerning the degree to which databases
may or may not threaten narrative forms of thought
and meaning (N. Katherine Hayles); the ideological,
as opposed to the supposedly libratory, effects of
databases, especially mediated by large, corporate
interfaces like Google (Jonathan Freedman); the
extent to which the seemingly new logic of databases
remediates pre-digital, even ancient literacies (Peter
Stallybrass and Meredith L. McGill); whether or not
the database can be called a genre, perhaps even
belonging to the “epic” genre that crosses national
and historical boundaries (Wai Chee Dimock); and the
problems of deciding whether a tool like The Walt
Whitman Archive is really a database at all (Jerome
McGann).
Beyond particular insights into the database/
narrative question, this talk will explore how the
very unlikeliness of this dialogue of You Suck

at Photoshop and “Remapping Genre” points to
emergent affinities and even alliances among popular,
academic, and economically “productive” discourses.
If these potential alliances have not been sufficiently
described, it is not from lack of trying, however. In
his monumental book The Laws of Cool, for instance,
literary critic and digital theorist Alan Liu attempts
to imagine the relationship between the cultures of
“the literary”— not just “works of literature as such,”
he says, but “the underlying sense of the literary”—
and of digital “knowledge work” characterized by
an ethos of “cool” (1, 3). “In [capitalism’s] regime
of systematic innovation [and creative destruction],”
he asks at the beginning of the book, “is the
very notion of the literary doomed to extinction if
—or, rather, especially if—it dares to imagine a
literature of the database, spreadsheet, report, and
Web page?” (3). Essentially, Liu is questioning just
how “the contemporary humanities and arts…[might]
not only make contact with the generations of cool but
lead them beyond the present limitations of cool” (381).
In his somber Epilogue, Liu declares, “I am a believer
at heart…. I think literature will indeed have a place
in a new-media world…. But what the eventual nature
and position of that literature will be among the
convergent data streams of the future is something I
do not yet know how to theorize” (389). Like Richard
Lanham, Katherine Hayles, and other scholars leading
the search for the Holy Grail of would-be database
literature, Liu tends to look for examples in highcultural practices of Internet Art, or what he more
inclusively terms “ethical hacking,” but Liu ultimately
finds them “too closely associated with anarchist,
Situationalist, radical leftist, and/or high-theoretical
paradigms…to offer persuasive models for an art
that might affect the knowledge worker in his or her
ordinary cubicle” (397-98). This talk will argue that such
persuasive models, or perhaps models of models, can
be found in the ordinary cubicles of slackers like Donny
Hoyle—but only if academic culture can develop the
critical idiom to describe them.

Medical Case Studies on
Renaissance Melancholy: Online
Publication Project

digital methods and tools, and finally to reflect on the
evolution of the project in the years to come.

Suciu, Radu

This project uses the TEI recommendations for the
transcription and the encoding of early modern medical
texts. The TEI has been demonstrated to be the most
comprehensive way of transcribing rich, complex texts
by a number of major projects 1. TEI documents are
then stored in an online database that uses and adapts
the open source CMS Omeka 2, now a standard tool
for the creation of online repositories of documents
and virtual exhibitions. We shall present the way in
which we have used and adapted Omeka’s plugins and
themes. We shall also discuss the metadata structuring
choices we have made. Since this is handled directly
by Omeka, it facilitates the creation of an OAI
repository, which can be made directly accessible to
data-harvesters 3 and eases integration with research
management applications such as Zotero.

Université Paris-Diderot France

This paper presents the intermediary results of our
ongoing research project at the Université ParisDiderot as part of a post-doctoral bursary awarded by
the Mayor of Paris’s Research in Paris 2010 program.
The project aims at combining traditional research
methods (research, annotation and publication of early
modern texts and documents) with open source tools
and standards (Omeka, Zotero, TEI), with the goal of
publishing an online encyclopedia of case studies on
medicine and melancholy in the late Renaissance.

2. Historical Background
The principal research question asked is: how did the
Renaissance physician position himself in relation to
his patient, and how does he attempt to document
his ‘clinical’ experiences in writing? The case histories
of those suffering from melancholy are instrumental
in understanding this issue: tormented by various
hallucinations and deliria, the melancholy see what
is not there and live in a world of strange delusion,
variously believing that they have no head, or are made
of brick, or of butter, and so forth. The patient who
famously believed his body to have been transformed
into butter feared even approaching the oven (an
awkward situation since his line of work was in baking
bread), while yet another was convinced he was
missing one leg, bitten off by an imaginary crocodile.
Cases such as these are at the heart of our research:
we have examined not only early modern medical
documents, but also many important collections of
commonplace books in our search for case studies,
patient descriptions, medical observations, and socalled ‘curative epistles’.

3. Online Publication of the Research Materials
Rather than a traditional publication in print, the results
are being progressively published online with the aid
of a number of open source tools. The principal aims
of this paper are to present the various preparatory
research stages, the choices made in implementing the

4. Methods and Tools: TEI Transcription,
Omeka, Zotero Integration

5. Conclusion: Putting the University Database
on Virtual Exhibition
The textual documents transcribed and added via the
Omeka database are to be accompanied by critical
annotations, literary transpositions or references and
by a collection of images or an index of commonplaces.
The website, unlike a scholarly publication, will
be more easily accessible and reach a wider
audience, while the database, making use of Web
2.0 technologies, will function as a virtual exhibition,
an online ‘cabinet of curiosities’, allowing readers
to interact with, comment on and contribute to the
published materials. With this in mind, the ultimate
aim of this digital humanities project is to generate
a broader interest in early modern research and
history by focusing on melancholy, a subject that has
never ceased to influence and inform disciplines from
medicine to literature.

Dictionaries lie at the core of the human ability to
conceptualize, systematize and convey meaning. But
a dictionary (both print and digital) is many things at
once: a text, a tool, a model of language, and a cultural
object deeply embedded in the historical moment of
its production (Tasovac, 2010). While it is true that
we now live in the age of the electronic dictionary
(de Schryver, 2003), dictionaries have always played
an important role in the interplay between production
technology and knowledge taxonomies (McArthur,
1986; Hüllen and Schulze, 1988; Hüllen, 1999). In
this respect, historical dictionaries remain particularly
valuable objects of study because they illustrate
sociolinguistic perceptions and reveal culturally
shaded conceptualizations of lexical knowledge of
a particular epoch — often in stark contrast to our
contemporary attitudes and values. Moreover, they
pose a veritable challange for text encoding, semantic
markup and database modeling (Fomin and Toner,
2006; Nyhan, 2006; Nyhan, 2008; Mooijaart and
van der Wal, 2009; Lemnitzer et al., 2010). This is
why all dictionaries, including retrodigitized historical
dictionaries, are important for digital humanities, and
why DH — with its concern for (abstract) modeling
of knowledge and its (practical) implementations in
humanities research — can integrate and propel
different trains of lexicographic and metalexicographic
thought at the intersection of language and technology.
Many DH research projects have aimed to produce
electronic editions of printed lexicons (see for instance
Morrissey, 1993; Lemberg et al., 1998; Christmann,
2001; Fournier, 2001). In such efforts, retrodigitization
is usually based on one of two approaches: either
the production of “faithful“ digital copies (at the
cost of reproducing factual or typographic errors),
or the structural modelling of the content, which

243

Digital Humanities 2011

treats the print edition as a data source, rather
than as an immutable text to be reproduced in
its entirety (Lobenstein-Reichmann, 2008). In either
case, retrodigitization projects tend not to involve any
degree of re-editing or expanding the actual content of
historical dictionaries.
We agree with Kirkness (2008) that digitalizing
historical dictionaries can increase and optimize
their use value, especially in global, networked
environments. But we also feel that one central
aspect is often overlooked in current studies of
retrodigitized dictionaries: users interacting with a
historic lexicon do no longer necessarily have active
command of the text's primary language. Even
when historical dictionaries are retrodigitized with
the user's needs in mind, the focus is usually
on easy-to-handle navigation, presentation layout
and retrieval of elements from a full-text search
(Christmann, 2003); or on uniformization of existing
data elements, such as dates (Kinable, 2006). While
these efforts are worthwhile and necessary because
they contribute greatly to editions that are more
usable and eﬃcient than their hardcopy counterparts,
electronic dictionaries remain in essence lookup tools
(for words encountered in a given text) rather than
exploratory tools (for unknown words or concepts).
This, we believe, can reduce both their scholarly and
popular appeal.
It may seem unlikely at ﬁrst that historical
dictionaries can generate non-academic interest,
but experience has shown that there is a broad
audience outside highly professionalized linguistic
circles that is both curious and enthusiastic about
exploring the historic and ethnographic fabric of a
language (Kirkness, 2008). In our own web-project
— “Reklakaza.la” (Serbian for “hearsay”) — we
have been publishing online selected entries from
the classic, 19th-century Serbian Dictionary by Vuk
Stefanović Karadžić and linking them via social
networks Twitter (http://twitter.com/ Vuk_Karadzic)
and Facebook (http://facebook.com/reklakaza.la). The
project has gained more than 24,000 fans on Facebook
alone, becoming a platform for bringing meaningful
humanities inquiry into the public conversation,
fostering the sense of community, sharing, and mutual
learning that proves the relevance of the humanities
in today's world despite academic budget cuts and
declining job opportunities.
The success of our pilot project has strengthened
our conviction that a modern, electronic edition of
Karadžić's dictionary is long overdue. Vuk Stefanović
Karadžić (1787-1864), the linguist, folklorist and
reformer of the Serbian language, published his
244

landmark Srpski rječnik, istumačen njemačkijem i
latinskijem riječima — Lexicon Serbico-GermanicoLatinum in two editions (1818 and 1852). This ﬁrst
lexicon of the modern Serbian vernacular, rather
than the Church-Slavic hybrid language used by the
educated elites up to the 19th century, has a unique
place in the history of not only the Serbian language,
but the South Slavic diasystem in general (Дмитриев
and Сафронов, 1984; Wilson, 1986; Стојановић,
1987; Eschker, 1988; Potthoff, 1990; Ивић, 1990;
Vitalich, 2005; Кулаковский, 2005). The text is rich
with ethnographic and anthropological material. Not
only do many entries contain examples of Balkan
folk storytelling, but some are themselves structured
as historical, cultural and ethnographic narratives
that offer informative sketches and sometimes even
very detailed accounts of the myths and realities of
the Balkan past (see, for instance, entries for кмет,
отмица, мора, хајдук, etc.).
Though it was republished twice (in 1898 and 1935),
the Lexicon has not been reprinted since (other than in
facsimile editions). Meeting the needs of modern-day
users, however, presents a host of editorial challenges.
The entries in the Lexicon are written mainly in a dialect
which is on the margins of contemporary standard
Serbian. Thus, the lexicographic material is not always
entirely understood by contemporary speakers, and
can often appear obscure or unwieldy. It is hard for
the average user to answer questions such as: what
was the early 19th-century equivalent of a mod-ern-day
Serbian word? What household objects, for instance,
are listed in Karadžić‘s dictionary? What words were
difficult or impossible for Karadžić to translate into
German or Latin?
Our “Annotated Digital Edition of Vuk Stefanović
Karadžić’s Srpski rječnik” is therefore conceived as
a resource that caters to access needs and habits
of modern scholars, teachers, students, and, last but
not least, general readers. The entries are marked up
XML, in compliance with the Guidelines of the Text
Encoding Initiative (Burnard et al., 2006). In this, initial
phase of the project, we are focusing solely on text
encoding, but in view of the potential use in a data-base
driven web-application at a later stage.
In addition to marking up existing structural elements
of a dictionary entry (such as lemma, part of
speech, senses, deﬁnitions, translation equivalents,
examples etc.), our work supplies important additional
information that will enhance the modern-day user's
interaction with the dictionary, including:

Digital Humanities 2011

- standard Serbian equivalents to dialect word forms
(e.g. бичевање vs. бичкарење, мешина vs.
мљешина, енглески vs. инглешки);
- Serbian ekavian word-forms to both standard and
east-Herzegovina jekavian entries (e.g. терати vs.
тјерати, терати vs. ћерати);
- both the original 19th-century accentuation (e.g.
кòчија̑шки) and its modern-day graphic equivalent
(кòчија̄шкӣ);
- indications when modern-day accentuation differs
from the from found in the Lexicon (e.g. мо̑ре vs.
мо̏ре, das Meer, mare);
- an extension of the extant cross-reference system
through linking synonymous and near-synonymous
entries that have been overlooked by previous
editors (e.g. жаба and напнигуша; обрљуга and
неопера).
- labeling of Turkisms overlooked by previous editors
(e.g. була, инћар, џукела);
- marking up persons, places and dates for easy
indexing and analysis;
- indications of word usage (eg. ист. and ист.
кр. as <usage type="geo">East</usg> for better
statistical analysis and possible further processing
and creation of geo-spatial word maps etc.);
- marking up instances where Karadžić uses a ﬁrstperson narrative to explain an entry;
- indications of the edition in which entries appeared
for the ﬁrst time, etc.
Furthermore, we are assigning semantic domain
labels to word senses in accordance with Magnini
and Cavaglia, 2000; Bentivogli et al., 2004, crossreferencing senses with the Transpoetika Dictionary
— a bilingualized, Wordnet-based Serbian-English
dictionary (Tasovac, 2009), and providing English
glosses in addition to the existing German and Latin. All
of this will help us meet our goal of moving beyond the
current paradigm of limiting retrodigital text editing to
the creation of electronic replicas of hardcopy lexicons
or semantically structured electronic representations
of the original data source. We are interested in
hybrid approaches that respect the integrity of the
original text, but also take advantage of the digital
medium to create modern, deeply-encoded, usercentered editions of historical dictionaries, which can
not only provide look-up mechanisms for particular
words, but also function as exploratory tools for various
types of knowledge discovery.

Some practical advantages of our edition of Vuk
Karadžić's dictionary will include reverse look-ups,
allowing a user to search an English, German, or Latin
word and ﬁnd its Serbian equivalent in the Lexicon. The
domain labels will provide researchers with valuable
and, for the ﬁrst time, measurable information about
the clusters of paradigmatically related terms, as
well as the extent of domain ambiguity and domain
variability. Users will be able to treat semantic domains
as thematic entry points into the dictionary, looking up,
for instance, all entries that belong to AGRICULTURE,
FOLKLORE, HISTORY or GASTRONOMY; while
our logically and semantically consistent markup of
Karadžić's own usage notes will make it possible for
users to easily explore regional and dialectological
distribution of entries in the Lexicon, offering a basis for
subsequent work that could involve data visualization,
statistical analysis, text mining etc.

Probabilistic Analysis of Middle
English Orthography: the
Auchinleck Manuscript
Thaisen, Jacob

jthaisen@gmail.com
University of Stavanger

The bulk of the literary materials that survive from
the Middle English period are scribal copies, rather
than authorial compositions. Such copies pose a
challenge to the stylometrist, the reason being that
copies written in a single scribal hand may have nonidentical orthographic profiles. Their non-identity is a
product of their transmission history, as the typical
copy will contain both spelling forms originating in
the exemplars and other such forms introduced by
the scribe. Historical dialectologists have developed
methods for separating the mix of scribal usage
and exemplar usage typically recorded in a single
scribal copy. Although powerful, these methods rely on
questionnaire-based interrogation of text samples and
subsequent visual analysis of spelling forms arranged
in tables. The arrival of digital transcripts has sped up
the data collection process and has led to compilation
of fuller profiles, but the questionnaire itself has stayed.
Thus, these methods fail to take full advantage of the
digital medium.
This presentation demonstrates that a purpose of
identifying and isolating locations in which the makeup
of the spelling system changes during the full text of a
longer Middle English literary manuscript may be met
by probability-based comparison of text samples. What
spelling forms happen to be attested in a given text
is a function of what words happen to make up that
text. The direct comparison of texts is therefore not
readily possible. It has typically been made possible by
considering profiles recording only the spelling forms
of those words which may reasonably be expected to
occur in every text, such as function words like "such",
"that", and "these". The alternative solution proposed
in this paper is to base assessment of similarity on
"models" of text samples' spelling–exhaustive profiles
of which letters and letter sequences occur in them
and with which frequency. I shall refer to single letters
as unigrams, ordered sequences of two letters as
bigrams, etc. Such models are easily compiled from
electronic diplomatic transcripts. The dissolution into
n-grams is equal to identification of the between texts

because comparison of the building blocks is in itself
relatively independent of the word level.
Similarity is measured between a text sample (the
test sample) and a model derived from another text
sample (the training sample). It is expressed as the
overall probability that the test sample is an instance
of the same spelling system as the system modelled.
Computing this probability proceeds, with a trigram
model, from consideration of each unigram in the
context of the bigram preceding it–the reader may
correctly recognise the "Markov assumption" in this
description. What is output, however, is the reciprocal
of the average probability per gram. This entity, called
"perplexity", will conveniently always be a positive
number larger than 1 with the present type of data.
Moreover, techniques exist for "smoothing" a model,
that is for reducing its dependence on the words
constituting the training sample. This reduction is
achieved by statistically manipulating the probabilities
computed for the training sample n-grams. Smoothing
additionally leads to probability being assigned to
spelling forms unattested in the training sample.
It is these properties of these techniques that makes
their application on n-gram models based on Middle
English texts further increase the comparability of
those texts. Probabilistic modeling techniques have,
however, as far as I am aware, rarely been applied
for the stylometric analysis of Middle English materials,
and it has yet to be established which specific
smoothing technique produces the most satisfactory
models of those materials.
A simple example may illustrate. The spelling forms
<suich, suyche, such> for the word "such" are found
in text A, while the same word is spelt <suche> in
text B. Intuitively, the text B spelling form <suche>
falls within the range of variation characteristic of
the spelling system of text A but happens to be
unattested in it, while other known Middle English
forms such as as <swylke, suilk> do not. The present
methodology involves dissolving <suche> into <su,
suc, uch, che, he> and establishing the smoothed
conditional probability for each of these trigram building
blocks in text A (thus obtaining a intuition that the
spelling form is possible in the spelling system of text A.
In practice, however, the quantification is not effected
for the individual form but for the whole of text B in
relation to text A.
To illustrate the adequacy of perplexity-based
comparison in stylometry, I trace changes in spelling
in a large manuscript collecting several Middle
English literary works. The corpus is the Auchinleck
manuscript, Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland,
247

Digital Humanities 2011

Advocates' MS 19.2.1, produced in the LondonWestminster area in the first half of the fourteenth
century. The potential influences on the scribes include
the literary structure, as the codex's total of almost
59,000 lines of text are divided between no less
than forty-four literary works representing a range
of genres. A map showing locations in which the
spelling system changes during the full text of the
Auchinleck manuscript may be expected to reflect the
literary structure only if the exemplars did so and
the Auchinleck scribes reproduced them slavishly. By
contrast, it is the boundaries of the scribal contributions
that will be visible in the map if each scribe thoroughly
converted into his own spelling system when copying.
Six scribal hands are present. Of these, Scribe 4's
contribution is too short (551 words) to constitute
a reliable sample, while the usages of the other
five scribes should be visible. They are distinct in
terms of their typological classification on the dialect
continuum, although they fall into an eastern cluster
and a western one. Dialect analysis has thus placed
Scribe 1 in Middlesex, Scribe 2 on the GloucestershireWorcestershire border, Scribe 3 in London, Scribe 5
in Essex, and Scribe 6 in Worcestershire (McIntosh,
Samuels, et al 1986, I: 88; LPs 6510, 6940, 6500, 6350,
and 7820).
To be able to compute and compare probability
for sections of the Auchinleck manuscript against
one another, I obtained a digital transcript of its
text from the Oxford Text Archive (Burnley and
Wiggins 2003). The transcript is suitable, because
rather than modernise the spelling forms found in its
source, it reproduces the source in conformity with
standard practice of diplomatic transcription. My tool
for constructing models and computing perplexity is
the SRI Language Modeling Toolkit (SRILM; Stolcke
2002); this toolkit is freely available for noncommercial
purposes from the website of its SRILM constructed
and smoothed an interpolated model for every 200line section; the smoothing technique selected was that
described by Witten and Bell (1991). This technique
was developed for purposes of text compression at the
level of the word but it is appropriate for application on
Middle English spelling data too. The reason is that the
technique effectively assigns probability to collocating
letters as if they were a single letter, rather than a
series of independent units.
The toolkit took the same modified transcripts of all the
sections as the input and computed their similarity with
the models. The computation resulted in a separate
model for each section, and for every such model,
a separate perplexity for every section. I established
the mean perplexity and standard deviation for the
248

perplexities obtained for each model. The box and
whisker graph below shows the results. In this graph
the vertical axis gives perplexity and the horizontal
axis position in the text of the Auchinleck manuscript.
The diamond represents mean perplexity and the Tbar represents half a standard deviation, so that one
upright T-bar and its reverse together indicate an
interval of one standard deviation from the mean. A
dashed vertical line appears for ease of reference
at the boundary of a scribal stint as established
by palaeographers (Bliss 1951), with the outlined
numbers identifying the scribes.
As is apparent, the figure distinguishes the scribes
of the Auchinleck manuscript. The rises and falls
in mean perplexity during the text strongly correlate
with the boundaries of the scribal stints, while mean
perplexity is relatively constant within every such stint.
Repetion of the experiment with other divisions of the
text produced results sufficiently similar to Figure 1 to
establish the pattern as being a property of the data
rather than an artefact of the method.
It would have been time-consuming indeed to conduct
a questionnaire-based interrogation of the full text
of the Auchinleck manuscript. Visual analysis of the
resulting profile to identify and isolate locations in
which the spelling system changes would, moreover,
have been complex, because of the amount of data
and difficulty of isolating the diagnostic features.
Perplexity-based comparison as illustrated above, by
contrast, requires little preprocessing of the transcript,
is effected in an afternoon, and is based on all the
available data.

In the very early days of the world wide web,
but well into a period in which our community
understand the positive and transformative impact
that computational technique has had on scholarly
editing, Fortier reminded us that literary studies is
and always has been focused on the study of texts
regardless of interpretive theoretical predisposition.
In digital literary studies, that textual focus manifests
in a number of theories about the nature of the
text in general and the electronic scholarly edition
in particular, and has developed such that a basic
typology of electronic scholarly editions is relatively
straightforward to construct via the approach taken
in handling textual materials. Well into what is often
called the age of Web 2.0, it is worth noting that
prominent types of electronic scholarly editions were
largely developed before the ubiquity of the world wide
web that we now enjoy and do not accurately reflect its
current academic engagement. Indeed, given that we
have now entered a new phase in the social formation
of the web, we can no longer ignore the influence
of new networks and connections on the scholarly
digital edition. Our understanding of the electronic
scholarly edition requires reconsideration in light of the
collaborative potential of current and emerging digital
technologies; put another way, we need to extend our
typology in light of new models of edition production
that embrace social networking and its commensurate
toolkit. We propose that, while the digital medium is
most certainly a productive space in which to analyse
editions (as proposed by Hans Walter Gabler), the
social incarnation of the digital edition allows us to
249

Digital Humanities 2011

refocus our systematic analysis of texts, thus furthering
the reconfiguration of the hierarchy for reading both
texts and editions.
This working paper offers a new understanding of
the historical underpinnings of the scholarly and
digital editions, and envisions the possibilities of the
scholarly social edition. It is generally accepted that
there are several basic models for electronic editions
of a scholarly nature, each put forward before the
advent of the world wide web -- each demonstrating
disparity within and among approaches in handling
the text that lies at their centre. Using Unsworth’s
scholarly primitives as a model for describing the set
of activities common to humanities scholars, we have
developed a functional definition for the strategies
employed by expert readers: Analysis, Synthesis,
Communication, and Dissemination. New methods of
engagement are both social in nature and reflect
the interrelated nature of these strategies: analysis
and synthesis grow from communication that, in
turn, affects dissemination, and so forth. Based on
recent research concerning the reading strategies of
expert or professional readers, and the current state
of digital humanities scholarship, the next step in
the development of the scholarly edition is one that
reflects the importance of collaboration, incorporates
contributions by its readers, and where the editor
acts as a facilitator for user involvement rather than
enjoying an unassailable final word. Our model of the
social edition points to new methods of engagement in
digital literary studies. The social edition embraces the
collective (but without losing sight of the individual) and
accepts that no edition is ever truly complete.
Despite Stephen Nichols’s call to ‘dismantle the silo
model of digital scholarship,’ many digital editions, like
print editions, continue to exist as self-contained units
that do not encourage interaction with other resources.
Instead we would argue that the social edition grows
from Greg Crane‘s exhortation: ‘[w]e need to shift
from lone editorials and monumental editions to
editors as … editors, who coordinate contributions
from many sources and oversee living editions.’
The movement toward social edition production
has already begun, with projects such as EEBO
interactions, ‘a social networking resource for Early
English Books Online’ (http://eebo-interaction
s.chadwyck.com) and George Mason University’s
‘Crowdsourcing Documentary Transcription: an Open
Source Tool,’ (http://scripto.org/) which is
described as ‘an open source tool that would allow
scholars to contribute document transcriptions and
research notes to digital archival projects, using the
Papers of the War Department as a test case.’ These
250

projects, among others, point to a growing need in
the scholarly community to expand our knowledge
communities using the social technologies at our
disposal. With the understanding that we cannot
prophesize the exact nature of the social edition at this
current juncture, we do, however, wish to reiterate the
importance of seeing the scholarly text as a process,
and the initial, primary editor as a facilitator, rather than
progenitor, of knowledge creation.

1. Introduction
This paper describes the methodology used in
the creation of digital chapters and subsequent
recreation of digital entities or objects derived,
modified, transformed and visualised from XML
encoded scholarship. It considers the changing
function of traditional printed theses and how the use of
technologies affects the representation and functions
of graduate digital scholarship.
This paper is based upon the working methodologies
of two PhD theses. Specifically, Webb’s thesis
examines the creation of factlets and subsequent
visualisation of factoids, which inform not only
the source information and encoding but also the
development and completion of historical research
outputs. These outputs, supported by XML, XQuery
and factlets, demonstrate the use of digital technology
as an essential feature of humanities research and
its methodologies. Teehan’s thesis reflects upon
current digital representation models for pre-existing
sources relevant to humanities research. Focusing on
transactional, or functional, documents, it proposes
a methodology for contextually modeling and XMLencoding those resources, using established software
engineering and computer science paradigms such
as Use Case analysis and UML modeling, which
foreground the User. Both theses examine procedures
and strategies for conducting humanities research
using digital tools and applications. Thus, this paper is
252

Digital Humanities 2011

central to a reflective and reflexive process resulting
from, and in, the critical self-evaluation of the theses
and their outputs.
Traditionally, research outputs codified as chapters
or sections can be seen as the final manifestation
of a PhD thesis and reflect the use of print
or static technology. The functionality of these
outputs varies according to different headings and
ranges from literature reviews, general narrative
and concept generation, to the development of
structured arguments based on theory and source
material, to the provision of essential referencing
and bibliographic material. These functions are
referred to as “generic characteristics of academic
discourse” (Mingwei, 2010) in linguistic structural
analysis. Chapter functionality represents and reflects
the original research statement and provides the
means to convey and articulate traditional scholarship
within the medium of print. The use of XML, and XSLT,
along with the provision of software libraries, creates a
framework to add dynamic functionality to an otherwise
static text. “Generic characteristics” (Mingwei, 2010)
are encoded, which enable the use of the described
framework.
This approach reflects the innate capability of the
digital medium to layer extra functionality over the
restricted functionality of printed works. Rather than
creating just a single representation of scholarly output,
the use of XSLT and software libraries generates
and encourages a reflexive process between text,
argument, narrative and source material.
These methods change reader and user activity - one
user may be a reader while another may have access
to an interactive environment. Different user roles
and environments transform the user from a passive
participant to an active one. The realisation of various
use cases enables the user to do more than just read
the text and this activity realises the importance of data
reusability.
Figure 1 outlines the process involved in creating
multiple representations of digital scholarship and will
be used to detail the various stages involved in creating
new digital objects based on specified use cases.

Figure 1: The stages of creating new research outputs,
various chapters are defined by various use cases.

2. Stage 1 - Defining the Use Cases, Creating
the Model, Encoding the Source
Text is innately encoded with semantics and
functionality and each chapter or section in a
piece of scholarship establishes or conveys various
essential processes in the life of a text. These
processes consist of deduction, concept development,
narrative, consequence, etc., and it is these “lexical
relations” (Eggins, 2004) within a text which develop
specific research statements. Other bibliographic
properties of a section are concrete rather than
abstract and provide essential functionality e.g.
references, footnotes, paragraphs and titles.
Despite these multiple perspectives, transformation
of a born-digital text (a thesis) into both the print
and digital media relies upon the existence of a
single, defining text-model. Figure 1 shows the process
involved in creating new research objects. The first
stage makes possible all subsequent processes;
creating a unifying model allows the generation of
XML schema and subsequent XML encoding in order
to manifest the new research objects (the various
chapters in a research thesis). The model is driven
by specific Use Cases such as the production of both
a static printed version of the text, and an interactive
digital version.
The source chapters are encoded at the final
stages of the research process, rather than during
the writing process. The model considers both
presentation properties (chapter, paragraph, section),
which allows for transformations specifically for
253

Digital Humanities 2011

presentation purposes, and semantic properties which
encode the “textual semantics” (Eggins, 2004) of the
text, its logical class (Teehan, 2010). This approach
makes the text reusable and ensures “a single
lexical can function very differently” (Landow, 2006) in
different environments.
The model is translated into a schema which allows
us to mark up the content of the scholarship, including
narrative which in historical research pertains to
‘logical’ rather than ‘ideological’ content. We view
narrative as the logical information contained in the
text that contributes to a narrative of the past (Coffin,
2002). The encoding of dynamic narrative and data
supports the creation of new research outputs as nonlinear components derived from the text.

interaction between the narrative and various digital
objects within the digital medium. Figure 2

3. Stages 2 and 3 - Realising Use Cases

4. Conclusion

Stage 2 and 3 are the realisation of the various Use
Cases. The XSLT transforms and software libraries
are templates from which different text from different
sources can be modified and transformed, in effect
creating a suite of tools.

This paper demonstrates the process and production
of support tools for digital scholarship, and how the
creation of appropriate templates can make manifest
various representations of Digital Humanities PhD
theses from a single model. The Use Cases are reliant
on the ability of the encoding and the schema to
encapsulate both the functions of the text and the
various transformations and software libraries. Figure
2 demonstrates the interactions between the encoded
text, the transformations and the outputs.

These various macros are supporting tools for
manifestations of a text. Our encoded texts depict the
various functions embedded in standard print theses,
but augment those capabilities for these born-digital
theses. Here, two specific Use Cases address (i)
the creation of a dynamic bibliographic referencing
model, and (ii) the context-dependent presentation of
boundary objects.
A referencing model in XSLT can automatically create
a dynamic bibliography for a chapter with features
including “intertextual links” (Samraj, 2008) between
the text and source material. Software libraries can be
used to support the innate variability of a boundary
object, which is defined as an object with user
dependent functionality and meaning (Thomas). Thus,
depending on the User’s activity and perspective, the
presentation of the boundary object will change; for
instance, a table diagram, static in the print version,
may become interactive within a digital context.
These low-level Use Cases support our higher level
one; dynamic creation of static or interactive versions
of a base text-model. The print model transforms
the original text to a print ready text, and can
account for various institutional templates. Embedding
references to the various primary sources used in
the XML encoding instructs an XSLT to create a
hypertext of linked resources and creates “intertextual
links” (Samraj, 2008) and boundary objects for user

254

Current research students in Digital Humanities
constitute a newly ‘born digital’ generation, the
nature of whose outputs differs markedly from earlier
generations. Reflections on this changing process
should also include an analysis of new methods
and techniques to create dynamic scholarship. The
encoding of the final phase in a PhD thesis
allows scholarship to be reused, modified, visualised
and transformed, allowing for greater distribution
and accessibility of digital scholarship. Thus the
dissertation, in its multiple representations, can not
only remain central to the discipline of Digital
Humanities but shape its future development.

This paper presents preliminary results on
using computational analysis to understand the
representations and constructions of gender and
the body in fairy tales. While scholarship on
contemporary fairy tales utilizes various cuttingedge theories, ranging from postmodern narrative to
feminist theories of gender performance (Bacchilega
1997, Benson 2008, Smith 2007, and Tiffin 2009),
little of the research on canonical fairy tales or
oral folktales incorporates these recent theories.
Additionally, folkloristic research on fairy tales, whether
contemporary or traditional, would benefit from
incorporating computational methods such as network
analysis. These methods allow scholars to test their
theories more quickly and empirically.
Our research utilizes nearly three hundred canonical
fairy tales and oral folktales, deemed canonical
because they are from well-known collectors such
as the Brothers Grimm, or because the tales are
examples of well-known plots spanning time and space
in Europe (such as “Snow White” and “Cinderella”). We
combine textual and network analysis with disciplinespecific expert oversight for a large-scale, theoretically
informed discussion on gender and the body that would
not be possible without both in tandem. A feminist
critique of fairy tales is predicated upon the notion that
fairy tales construct and represent bodies differently
according to gender, yet no studies have shown
whether this difference actually exists in canonical
tales, or have addressed what this difference would
mean for studies of cultural values and narrative
strategies (Bottigheimer 1987, Haase 2004, and Stone
2008). Computational analysis of how bodies and
body parts are depicted in the text provides empirical
evidence against which this and other aspects of
feminist theory can be tested.

Digital Humanities 2011

Humanities scholars have already established a
vast theoretical and methodological framework for
interpreting texts, and they ought to be able to view
their data in the context of those theories developed
within their disciplines. This study combines traditional
critical analysis with computational tools in an attempt
to utilize the best of both worlds.

2. Data
Our analysis uses a hand-coded database
representing a geographically and temporally diverse
sample of tales. Careful attention was paid to the tale
tellers and collectors for further study of the context in
which bodies are depicted.
Fairy tales as a genre span oral, communal
performances and literary, single-author renditions. In
order to represent this spectrum, our database tracks
specific references to bodies in six tale collections.
We collected 13 data points from nearly three hundred
tales (Tale, Collection, Author, Teller, Collector, Year
of Writing/Collecting, Year of Publication, Tale Type,
Region, Original Language, Gender of Teller/Writer,
Gender of Collector, Gender of Editor) and categorized
another 14 data points for every mention of a body in
each tale, some evident in the texts (Noun, Adjective,
Surrounding Text, Page Number, Gender, Young/
Old, High/Low, Quoted Speech, Skin Tone) and
some requiring interpretation (Positive/Negative value,
Grotesque, Violence, Nudity, Move).
The database variables were chosen in light of preexisting work on structure and theory, creating a layer
of interpreted data that would not be found in full-text
analysis alone. The “Tale Type” classification system
gives tale plots numbers so that their transmission
can be traced as tales migrate across linguistic
and national boundaries. This is what allows us to
generalize about the worldview contained within the
tales, as the same plot with variations occurs between
multiple ethnic groups. The concept of “Moves” breaks
up tale plots into 5 distinctive plot pieces based on
folkloristic theory of how tales are structured.

3. Methodology
We use co-occurrence and vector analysis to explore
the database. Each field is compared against several
others in order to find correlations. For example,
“beautiful” may only be referenced with young women,
or old rich men may only appear in tales from
certain tellers. Using dimensionality reduction, we
can find which body parts tend to be discussed in
tandem in various situations. We also explore how the

256

representations of bodies change throughout the plots
of tales using Bengt Holbek’s “Moves.” Holbek built on
the work of Vladimir Propp, who identified the most
important plot points in sequence that could occur in a
fairy tale (31 points, or “functions,” total) (Holbek 1998).
Holbek condensed Propp’s functions into five “Moves,”
or clusters of thematic actions that move the tale’s plot
forward.
Finally, networks of database data are generated
and analyzed to test the hypothesis that fairy tales
construct bodies differently according to gender.
This analysis serves both as empirical evidence
to test a theory and also as an exploratory tool,
revealing possible correlations or links between body
representations that are not immediately apparent in
the texts.
Folklorists approach fairy tale interpretation in many
ways: ethnographic approaches seek connections
between the taletellers’ lives and the tales’ content;
historical approaches search for and analyze the
origins and diffusion of tales; structural analyses seek
to understand the underlying narrative of the tales;
psychological approaches search for latent meaning in
the tales; and feminist and sociohistorical approaches
interpret the meanings of the tales as they relate to,
convey values from, and inculcate values of the social
world. Feminist scholars have been particularly active
in critiquing the normative beauty scripts and gender
roles promoted in fairy tales. This study investigates
how gender roles are constructed and situated in
fairy tales, which is why we encoded categories to
investigate links between gender, age, and social
position, as well as where in the tale’s structure these
social values are relevant. We also hope to obtain
information about how female and male bodies are
valued differently, hence the relevance of variables like
“grotesque”.

4. Preliminary Results
Second-wave feminists such as Simone Beauvoir
developed the notion of the universal masculine
perspective, the idea that in Western culture, the
public, unmarked, assumed universal position is in fact
specifically male. Our data supports this assertion in
terms of female bodies being marked within fairy tales,
but we also believe that the same principle applies to
the age of bodies. Youthful bodies are assumed to be
the unmarked universal category in fairy tales.
The descriptions of old bodies are strikingly polarized:
old people are more likely than young to be described
as evil or good, wicked or wise. These findings
suggest that old bodies must be differentiated in fairy

Digital Humanities 2011

tales, because they are no longer in the supposedly
universal category of youth. Old bodies are qualified
with more descriptions in order to give audiences a
sense of who these characters are, since they don’t
fall into the category of the youthful protagonist, with
whom listeners are supposed to easily identify. If the
bodies in fairy tales had the same meanings across
age and gender, we would have seen a proportional
relationship between the number of references to types
of bodies, and the number of adjectival descriptions
attached to each. However, the data shows that young
men are associated with adjectival descriptions less
frequently than any other type of body. Old women,
in contrast, are associated with adjectival descriptions
more than any other grouping. Further, a wider variety
of adjectives are used to qualify old bodies than young
compared to the proportion they are mentioned. Figure
1 shows a sample of which adjectives are associated
with mentions of various bodies.

for digitizing and interpreting these texts could yield
valuable insights.
As digitization is interpretation (Tarte 2010), it is
necessary to be especially careful and theoreticallygrounded when choosing variables and selecting
exactly what data will populate the fields. The scholar
must also decide the most fruitful analyses to run
on the data available. These studies ought to also
include computational analyses that are not linked to
previous critical theories (like word frequency or cooccurrence), however, in order to check against biases
which might creep into variable choice. The ultimate
goal is to turn well-researched, theoretically sound
scholarly observations into machine actionable data
which can be analyzed to test the scholar’s hypotheses
and open the door for future studies.

The UCLA Encyclopedia of Egyptology (UEE) is a
digitally born online publication which provides users
with several interfaces to access and reproduce
content. Supported by several grants from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the UEE is a highly
mediated, peer reviewed information resource on
Egyptian history, art, archaeology, geography and
language, in which authors selected by an editorial
committee are commissioned to write substantial
articles with thorough bibliographies and web links.
Articles will be regularly updated and previous versions
of the text and other assets will remain available
throughout the lifetime of the resource, which in
principle is built for digital eternity. This time scale
may prove not to be of the same longevity as the
preservation of ancient Egyptian cultural heritage, but
is nevertheless fitting the mindset of scholars who
routinely deal with objects of 4000 years old.
The UEE is an English language resource, while all
head words or entry titles are translated also in Arabic,
French and German. The English abstracts are also
translated in Arabic and a standard feature of each
article. The content of the UEE is available in two
forms: the Open Version makes use of eScholarschip,
the online publication platform of the University of
California. Articles are presented in alphabetic order
of the titles, and can be downloaded as PDF
(http://escholarship.org/uc/nelc_uee). The UEE Full
Version provides a much more sophisticated platform,
where users can access information through a wide
range of searches, either based on the underlying
subject structure, article links, metadata, or through
an interactive time-map, which provides access to
articles, images and 3D VR reconstructions which
refer to the same area, the same time period or
both. The granularity of the time map encompasses
regions (using either modern or ancient subdivisions),
ancient sites, or particular features of the latter, such
as a specific gate way, or altar. At present the Full
Version is not yet publicly online, but will be moved
from development to production in the near future.

project development website at http://uee.ucla.edu.

The presentation will focus on the many lessons
learned while developing the project, including the
workflow of all the tasks which are literally performed
“behind the screen”. Since this is an international
project with editors in the United States, Canada,
France, Belgium, Great Britain, and Egypt, with authors
as well as peer reviewers from all over the world,
the project relies on a large number of disparate web
services, which are partly for free, partly subscription
based. The commissioning phase is tracked through a
number of online spread sheets through Google Docs.
Authors receive an invitation by email, which provides
them with the scope of the entry, a document with clear
indications of what should (not) be included, in order to
avoid duplication with related articles. Once an article
has been submitted, the peer review platform provided
by eScholarship, is used, which enables tracking and
automated prodding for authors and peer reviewers.
Since many of the authors are non-native speakers
of English, the UEE offers a substantive copy-editing
service, which streamlines the terminology, spelling
and links of the articles. The project coordination,
which involves communication on the progress of the
extensive mark-up in TEI which is the next phase
of bringing an article to online publication, makes
use of the commercial project management software
BaseCamp (http://37signals.com/).

agreement does not necessarily guarantee digital
preservation, because the libraries, at the forefront of
digital repository preservation as they are, are also
faced with the enormous costs and practical problems
of digital preservation. The awareness of the problem
is, however, a considerable part of the solution. The
financial sustainability is an enormous conundrum.
Users have come to expect free, high quality content,
academics celebrate the virtue of open access, and yet
to build a high quality resource comes with very real
costs that need to be covered. The presentation will
outline some of the avenues explored to ensure that
the UEE will have a long prosperous life.

An important point of discussion is the digital and
financial sustainability and the different solutions the
UEE has proposed to enable the project to expand
and be constantly renewed, which is perhaps the
greatest asset of an online resource. The history
of the venerable printed predecessor of the UEE,
the Lexikon der Ägyptologie (published from , shows
that bibliographies are outdated in five years after
publication, while Egyptological scholarship begins to
be outdated in approximately 20 years. Authors are
therefore asked to provide twice an update of their
article, and after that potentially a new entry will be
created, because the development of the discipline is
not only reflected in article content, but also in the
structure of the resource, the selection of entry titles,
and the emphasis on particular sub fields. The strict
version control has, therefore, an added benefit: over
the course of time the UEE will become effectively a
history of Egyptological thought and methodology.
This requires, however, that the digital content remains
available, and that the editorial process will keep
on running, two very demanding conditions. As for
digital stability: all assets of the UEE are housed
in the UCLA Digital Library, and are accessed
from a front-end server which is at present housed
at UCLA’s Academic Technology Services. This

Alan
Liu’s
“Imagining
the
New
Media
Encounter” (2008) calls for “a poiesis of digital
literary studies” through which we can renegotiate
the relationships between new and old media as
productive encounters rather than as something other
than “conversion” encounters. Liu helps us open
up a critical space in which to rethink how the
problematic notion of “conversion,” with its implications
of oppositional media, complete transformation, and
religious fervor, shape our understandings of related
pairs: writing and encoding, mimesis and creation,
imagination and simulation. We suggest that our
understanding of text markup is closely implicated
in our reimagination of writing, and that the modes
of modeling suggested by possible worlds scholars
may destabilize our understanding of mimesis and its
role in both literary composition and text markup. In
short, we propose considering markup as a “worldconstructing” (Doložel 1997) form of discourse.
Our starting point of reference is the long-standing
conceptual tension within the markup (and especially
the TEI) community between two models of markup.
The first is rooted in mimesis and surrogacy: the
domain of transcriptional and editorial markup. The
second is more concerned with meaning creation and
the domain of annotation, interpretation, authoring.
These two models have different textual commitments
and establish different relationships between text,
markup, reader, and encoder. In the first, the encoder
uses markup to transact a connection between a
text and a reader; it is understood that the markup
is non-transparent, but its role is to communicate
about the text and about its own role as transmission
medium, so that the reader can (to the greatest
extent possible) apprehend some truth of the text.
The primary commitment, the goal of the exercise,
is for the reader to have access to the text (that is,
to some textual artifact that pre-existed the markup
relationship). Some form of this approach is extremely
260

common in current applications of the TEI Guidelines:
for thematic research collections, scholarly editions,
linguistic corpora, oral histories, digital archives, and
the like.
The second model, though much less common in
practice, is of great importance theoretically as a
counterpoise to the first, and its importance has been
shadowed forth by a number of key interventions
during recent years. Theorists like Renear (2000)
and McGann (2004) in very different ways have
suggested that the performative and illocutionary
qualities of markup bear close scrutiny. SperbergMcQueen and Huitfeldt (2000) explored how markup
represents meaning (and by extension, suggest a
shift of emphasis onto markup itself as a meaningbearing system, apart from the text it marks). Flanders
(2006) and Flanders and Fiormonte (2007) have
turned attention to the rhetoric of authorial markup
and to its significance for scholarly communication,
thinking of markup as a discourse that is situated at the
boundary of production and reproduction. In this more
“authorial” model, the encoder uses markup to transact
a connection between herself and a reader that
concerns a text. The role of markup is to instantiate, to
bring into communicative reality, the encoder’s ideas
and beliefs about a textual ecology that is oriented
towards a particular textual artifact but is not limited
to representing that artifact. Rather, the markup may
represent a much broader context of interpretation,
related information, and argumentation for which the
text itself is only the catalyst or point of inspiration.
The most common examples in the present day
include annotation, “interpretive” markup such as the
association of themes and keywords with spans of text
(e.g. using the TEI @ana and interp mechanism), and
the creation of new documents such as articles using
an XML markup language as an authoring system.
But these examples do not really give us a field
within which to consider what —in a radical sense—
we might mean by “authorial markup”, or to pursue
the full critical pressure of McGann’s challenge to the
markup world: “No autopoietic process or form can be
simulated under the horizon of a structural model like
SGML” (McGann 2004, 201-2).
The way these questions are framed within the
digital humanities—as an opposition between mimetic
representation and presentation on the one hand, and
generative or creative authorship and interpretation on
the other—has a correlate in literary history. As Doležel
argues (1997), possible world texts, with their “worldconstructing” features, contrast with the strongly
mimetic and material world truth claims of “worldimaging” texts. We suggest that an exploration of a

Digital Humanities 2011

“possible worlds” ontology of non-mimetic discursive
modes may offer a critical vocabulary for thinking about
the relationship of authorial markup to other encoding
models. It can also help us describe how authorial
markup might leverage the formal tools of a structural
model in order to enact a generative or poetic mode of
markup.
We focus in particular on the authoring, interpretation,
and markup of texts from the early modern period that
concern themselves with precisely this domain. While
Gottfried Leibniz nominally inaugurated discussion
of possible worlds (in Essays on the Goodness of
God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil,
1710), early modern writers from Thomas More and
Sir Philip Sidney to René Descartes and Margaret
Cavendish were concerned with the ability of the
written word or number to, as Descartes put it, write
about that “which does not actually exist…but is
capable of so doing” (Descartes, Writing, 332). Such
propositional discourse refers less to a verifiable “real”
than to a set of possibilities without a fixed ontological
status. Instead, as Ruth Ronen suggests, “their state
of being is confined to what meaning-units of the
text reveal” (Ronen 1994, 98-9). The early modern
romance in particular (of which Cavendish is a major
exemplar) is the single prose genre most invested
in explicit exploration of the mimetic/poetic distinction
and in which narrative structures themselves enact
the generative logic of world-construction. Cavendish
herself argues in her 1667 A New World Called the
Blazing World, that her “romancicall” tale offers readers
a model by which “they may create worlds of their own,
and govern themselves as they please" (Cavendish
225). Her model of romantic poiesis draws on a poetic
tradition exemplified by Sidney’s Defense of Poesie
(1579), which refutes directly the critique that poiesis
is a form of feigning, by suggesting an epistemological
and ethical role for generative authoring.
When we turn from Cavendish’s own authoring
process to our own use of markup as a means of
representing and interpreting her text—and of creating
a new work of scholarship of which we are the authors
—these arguments have a double impact. Within the
world of an encoded text, the “meaning-units” include
(for our purposes, most significantly) the markup itself.
The markup itself becomes a world-generating mode
of knowing that must carry several registers of meaning
arising from different kinds of scholarly agency. There
are also important questions which we will address in
the full paper about how we can anchor and access the
domain of meaning such a world establishes.
Following Saul Kripke’s assertion that “possible worlds
are stipulated, not discovered by telescopes,” we see

in both Cavendish’s authoring and our reading and
encoding of her text a series of generative or poetic
“stipulations” that carry both epistemological and
ethical implications (cited in Doložel 1998, 787). We
stipulate that a given structure can be characterized
as a poem, or that a new paragraph begins in
this place. Because there is such agreement (e.g.
on disciplinary grounds) about how we read and
name literary structures, this stipulation reads like a
statement of fact, but if we consider more unfamiliar
genres (or genre-resistant texts, like the confounding
recursive narratives of Mary Wroth’s Urania or
entries in commonplace books), the contentiousness
of the assertion becomes more apparent. Possible
worlds theory elaborates on what such stipulations
accomplish, and on the terms in which we can
understand the truth-value of what is created thereby.
In the full version of this paper, we will consider how
schemas may operate as another way of modeling
the possible worlds of texts and genres, and also how
possible worlds theory may help us envision more
radically authorial forms of markup that may push our
ideas of text encoding as scholarly communication into
new terrain.

1. Short Paper Abstract
In October 2006 a small group of developers of
tools for digital textual scholarship, gathered under
the leadership of the Huygens ING, concluded
that there was an urgent need for a more
collaborative approach to digital tool development
in the humanities. Several problems plagued the
field: high duplication of effort, a shortage of quality
software development, poor exchange of development
and methodological knowledge, institutionalized
development, and consequent problems of nonsustainability and obsolescence. In 2008 this initiative
became a formal European funded project, COST
Action IS0704 'Interedition'. Since then, Interedition
262

Digital Humanities 2011

has been improving cooperation and fostering
interoperability in tool development for digital textual
scholarship. 1 This paper will reflect on the first results
that have emerged meanwhile.
We have identified four significant obstacles to
the widespread use of digital tools by humanities
scholars. First, applicability of tools to humanities
research is often lacking: in many cases the tools
are not tools researchers need. Second, development
capacity within the humanities is extremely limited
compared to scientific fields. Third, the sustainability
of these tools, in terms of their ongoing support
and maintenance requirements, is historically very
low. Finally and perhaps most critically, tool and
infrastructure availability and development is highly
institutionalized: scholars outside large research
projects or institutions often find themselves unable to
take advantage of the development work that might
otherwise benefit them substantially.
The researchers and developers in the Interedition
project have come up with an approach to the
problems of applicability, availability, and sustainability
that revolves around the concept of ‘microservices’.
A microservice is, ideally, a very small application
whose functionality is available over the Web by means
of a lightweight protocol (e.g. REST). Microservices
can be used programmatically in conjunction with
other such services, in multiplicative combinations, to
answer the individual need of any research project.
Microservices share a set of deceptively simple
principles: they are cheap and fast to develop;
cheaper and easy to maintain; address very specific
needs (that are shared between many researchers);
implement simple protocols that are easier to reuse
and exchange; can be combined to create larger
workflows useful to the individual scholar. This idea
is not new: already service-based architectures such
as SEASR/MEANDRE, and commercial services such
as Yahoo! Pipes, feature a ‘modular’ model, and
such architectures are increasingly considered to be
the best approach for software development within
humanities research.2 However, given the variety of
contexts and environments in humanities research, it
is critical that tools not be tied to a single unifying
infrastructure, which is a drawback of systems such as
SEASR or Yahoo! Pipes. If we are to make maximally
efficient use of humanities development capacity, any
scholar or developer should be able to contribute his
or her work to other projects with a minimum of effort;
this means that we cannot insist upon a standardized
infrastructure, platform, computing language, or even
data format. Moreover, there is no guarantee that any
such single infrastructure will be indefinitely available;

the infrastructure thus becomes a single point of
failure.
Over the past two years, Interedition has been putting
its theory to the test by exploring effective development
methods for tools for text criticism and literary analysis,
using the very limited resources available through
the COST framework. The result is a open-source
development ‘collective’ cooperating in ‘bootcamps’.
Cooperation does not require everyone to have the
same research goal, nor need they agree on the 'right'
way to approach textual scholarship. The resulting
tools are furthermore not tied to or centralized in
any single institution. The combined efforts of the
participants become a collection of microservices,
varying widely in implementation language, platform,
hosting provision, etc., according to the resources
and expertise available to the individual participant.
The only technical requirements placed on any
microservice are that it be web-accessible to other
services using a REST-like protocol, and that
information on its input requirements and output results
be available via an HTTP GET request.3 Thus, even
with a wide variety of implementation practice, small
microservices can be built up to perform tasks in a
larger workflow for ‘real’ and varied research purposes.
Current ‘live’ microservices are open source, which is
crucial both to the proposed model of cooperation for
research and development, to intellectual and scientific
transparency, and to sustainability. Many of them
are hosted on free cloud computing infrastructures
(e.g. Google App Engine or Heroku4) for increased
availability and reliability.
As a proof of principle Interedition chose to implement
as a microservice architecture a tool commonly wanted
for textual scholarship—collation of text witnesses—
and worked to design a set of web-based services that
could improve upon existing technologies. Designing
collation software for textual editors that would
substantially improve upon existing tools like the
NINES project’s JUXTA5 and Peter Robinson’s
COLLATE6 has been a significant challenge, and
one that has allowed the team to thoroughly
test their development model and architectural
approach with an important problem which, if
solved, would immediately benefit a broad community
of scholars. The result is CollateX7, developed
as a technical and methodological successor to
COLLATE, which reached the end of its supported
life around 2007. We will describe CollateX’s
decentralized development within the Open Source
community and how ‘bootcamps‘ brought together
an international team of developers and domain
263

Digital Humanities 2011

experts for requirements analysis, coordination of
development efforts and collaborative work on the
code base. We will also explain how Interedition’s
design principles were implemented by splitting the
collation process into functional tasks, each of which
can be implemented with a variety of small and welldefined software services; these services are then
loosely coupled to produce “the simplest solution that
could possibly work” for the different use cases to be
addressed. Three clearly separate functional tasks—
input tokenization, the alignment itself, and analysis
or visualization of the results—were identified and
implemented as microservices.
This ‘microservice model’, as exemplified by CollateX,
has another important advantage: it fits well with
current directions of thought on the form and function
of future digital scholarly editions. Rather than
simple and static online republication of books, it
is likely that future editions will be dynamic openended research environments8 composed of smaller
scholarly components from many different sources.
It is an ultimate goal of Interedition to leverage this
microservice architecture to facilitate such ‘distributed
editions’.

2. Poster Abstract
This poster presentation will demonstrate in detail
the technical aspects of Interedition’s ‘microservices
model’ for interoperability. The poster will serve as
the technical annex to the short paper on Interedition
and its development principles, and will describe in
detail the working of the various components that
make up CollateX, Interedition’s foremost proof-ofconcept implementation. At the poster presentation
CollateX will be running on a laptop to demonstrate its
capabilities.
We will also showcase some digital humanities
projects that are benefiting already from Interedition’s
approach to tool building. Examples include TILE
and T-PENN, both of which focus on the common
task of transcribing images of text and aligning this
transcription with the associated regions in the image.
When their commonalities are examined, a similar
set of core services might be deduced and a robust
set of modular services designed to improve upon
the advances these tools have already made. We
will take a more in depth look at the Beckett Digital
Manuscript Project on which the Centre for Manuscript
Genetics (University of Antwerp) is collaborating with
the Huygens ING. This project raises the question
within the framework of Interedition of how the
architecture of a digital archive containing modern
264

manuscripts can be designed in such a way that users
can autonomously collate textual units of their choice
with the help of Interedition’s collation web service and
thus decide for themselves how this digital architecture
functions – as an archive, as a genetic dossier, or as
an edition.
As a consequence of developments in digital scholarly
editing, the strict boundary between digital archives
and electronic editions is becoming increasingly
permeable, resulting in a continuum rather than a
dichotomy. Usually, archives are distinguished from
editions because the latter offer a critical apparatus.
Of all the interoperable tools developed within the
Interedition framework, the collation module has the
special merit that it can enable any user to transform a
digital archive into an electronic edition.
From the vantage point of editorial theory, this
development has interesting consequences regarding
the scholarly editor’s role, whose focus may shift
from the collation to a more interpretive function. In
this way, the integration of a collation tool may be
consequential in terms of bridging the gap between
genetic criticism and textual scholarship. From the
perspective of editorial practice, the application of
CollateX is still at an experimental stage, but it already
shows that the modular approach used by Interedition
has the potential to be useful both to the specialized
field of digital scholarly editing and to a more general
audience.

Digital Collections at Duke
University Libraries
Aery, Sean

Duke University

The digitization of primary sources for humanities
research marks one of the important ways that
the emergence of a digital culture has transformed
libraries, special collections, and other cultural heritage
organizations. The last fifteen years have seen a
wide range of initiatives among both small and large
organizations to expose unique artifacts, including
manuscripts, still photographs, film, audio and print.
The practice of digitizing primary sources has come to
be known in the vernacular of the library profession as
“digital collections.”
Staff at Duke University Libraries have collaborated
during the last part of 2010 on re-imagining, reengineering and re-implementing the web application
by which the library provides discovery and access for
its digital collections. Our work plan targets January of
2011 as a release date for the remade interface. As
part of an outreach effort to the research and education
communities that comprise the target audience for
this application, we propose a poster and demo
presentation at Digital Humanities ‘11.
For the development team at Duke, the project has
presented an opportunity to think in depth about the
landscape in which we publish our digital collections.
The application that we seek to replace went live in
January 2008, after an in-house development process
that was expedited to head off the decommissioning of
hardware. Since that time, we have considered how a
more measured development process might enable us
to upgrade the user experience.
We went through a lengthy process of gathering
feedback from users and stakeholders of the existing
digital collections site. We analyzed other libraries’
digital collections efforts, content-focused sites like
Flickr and Youtube, and retail sites like Netflix, Amazon
and Zappos. We also gave considerable thought to
the ways that open API’s, social networking and
concepts such as linked data transform the ways

that students, instructors and researchers experience
online resources.
Project manager Sean Aery has written extensively
about the project and included many screenshots of
the new page design on the library’s Digital Collections
Blog. His postings outline the research-heavy
approach that we took in developing the interface
design. In addition, we have worked to incorporate
linked data concepts into the underlying representation
of collections metadata. One of the objectives for this
project is to develop an open API for the collections,
to foster the development of applications by interested
users. Presenting the framework to digital humanities
scholars will prove invaluable in meeting this last
objective. [See the http://library.duke.edu/blogs/digitalcollections/category/website-redesign/].
One of the key decisions in our process was the
choice to decouple the digital collections interface from
other elements of our digital collections infrastructure.
The application is a standalone framework developed
in the Django platform, with Solr to provide the
faceted searching functionality, and a mechanism
for synchronizing data from other components. The
decoupling of this application from tools for developing
and managing content allows the development team to
work in short, iterative cycles, free from dependencies
on other aspects of the program’s technology
infrastructure.
- A significant selection of advertising-related
materials from one of Duke’s collection centers, the
John W. Hartman Center for Sales, Advertising and
Marketing History.
- Important documentary photography collections
such as the Sidney D. Gamble Photographs of earlytwentieth-century China.
- Many rare books not available in other venues.
Finally, and critically, all of these processes, decisions
and source code updates have come in the service
of a great body of important and compelling content
for humanities researchers. Much of the material is
housed in Duke’s Rare Book, Manuscript and Special
Collections Library, one of the world’s leading libraries
of its kind. Digitized collections include:
Duke has a very active Digital Production Center, and
we plan to publish a wide variety of new and compelling
materials in the first quarter of the new year. All of the
content is freely available for educators, students and
researchers.
Our process of learning from our users and patrons
does not end with the release of the new platform.
269

Digital Humanities 2011

We want to learn about ways we can improve the
quality of the collections and the experience. Our goal
is to make the digital collections a premier resource
for research and learning in the humanities and social
sciences. Digital humanities scholars comprise one
of our important target audiences, and the DH11
conference provides us an important opportunity to
engage in the discussion around this field of study.

Semantically Rich Tools for Text
Exploration: TEI and SEASR
Ashton, Andrew Thomas
Andrew_Ashton@brown.edu
Brown University Library

Much of the existing work of researchers using the Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines has been made
available on the web via processes such as XSLT
transformations, which are intended to reproduce a
work as an enhanced digital surrogate using HTML,
PDF, or another publication format. Recent innovations
in scholarly software design offer opportunities to
exploit the semantic depth of TEI collections by
creating new tools for textual analysis; tools that are
designed not specifically for digital publication, but
for creating mash-ups, data sets, and expressions
of semantic data intended for machine-readability,
rather than online readership. To explore these
opportunities, the Brown University Library’s Center for
Digital Scholarship (STG) and the Brown University
Women Writers Project (WWP) - with the support of
the National Endowment for the Humanities’ Digital
Humanities Start-Up Grant program - are developing
a prototype suite of software tools to explore TEI
encoded texts in the Software Environment for the
Advancement of Scholarly Research (SEASR). A
demonstration of these tools, information about their
availability, and a discussion about their usefulness
to digital humanities projects, offers an opportunity to
examine this approach to exploring digital texts.

2. Exploring Data Through Experimentation and
Play
SEASR is a software environment for creating and
sharing text and data mining tools. Textual analyses
and visualizations created in SEASR can be shared
on the web and adapted by other scholars to support
their own research. The characteristic of SEASR that
permits such exploration and interchange is its modular
approach to software architecture. Modularity – the
ability to share and reuse discrete pieces of software
within a broader framework – enables relatively simple
software tools to be combined to produce results that
were previously the domain of complex and often
proprietary software. Within the SEASR environment,
analysis is modeled as a “flow”: a pipeline, or a
series of “components” arranged to produce a specific
analysis (see figure 1). Each component in a flow is
270

Digital Humanities 2011

a small piece of software that ingests and processes
data, then passes it to the next component in the
flow. Each component performs a single function, but
through their recombination and sequencing SEASR
enables innumerable potential analyses. Once a flow
of components is constructed, it can be made publicly
available as a web service and reused on other
data. The SEASR framework permits components and
flows to be integrated into the publication interface
of a digital project (as a way of working with project
data), or to be used as part of an independent
web-based workbench through which a scholar could
examine data drawn from multiple projects. In addition,
scholars wishing to demonstrate a new analysis or
method can create interactive web applications to
make their work accessible and reproducible. And
because flows can be flexibly combined and altered,
they permit much greater latitude in scholarly inquiry,
instead of channeling text analysis into predetermined
sequences.
Designing a SEASR "flow"

women situate themselves as authors (in dedications,
letters to the reader, and acknowledgements)? To what
extent do women make use of cultural referents from
European history in situating their work, and how does
this change over time? In pursuing these questions a
researcher might use SEASR (either within a project
interface such as Women Writers Online, or within a
separate workbench application) to:
1. Extract and separate a collection of texts by
genre. In addition to offering text-level genre
information (based on a basic differentiation
between prose, verse, and drama, which MONK
also exploits), like many TEI projects the WWP
marks genre-specific structures within the text such
as poems, dramatic speeches, letters, recipes,
essays). SEASR modules can thus identify and
extract single genres of interest (all lyric poetry, for
instance) or divide the entire corpus by genre (verse,
drama, prose, etc.) at a specified level of granularity.
2. Extract specific pieces of text (quotes, verse
stanzas, dedications) for downstream analysis.
3. Distill from the selected texts or text pieces
the personal names, and separate these by
type (references to historical figures, mythological
figures, biblical figures; place names; etc.)
4. Sort a subset of data chronologically.
5. Pass the data through a component that adds
morphosyntactic information to each word.
6. Generate a visualization such as a stacked area
chart for each genre that analyzes changes in
the association of certain adjectives with personal
names, differentiated by gender.

Figure. Designing a SEASR "flow"

3. Working with TEI
TEI’s markup logic makes the semantic information
encoded in a text tractable for the purposes of
extraction, analysis, and reuse. When used in tandem
with other data mining and visualization tools available
in the SEASR environment (e.g., MONK, Simile,
OpenNLP), these TEI components for SEASR offer
new venues for exploring questions germane to literary
and textual scholars.
As an example, a research scenario involving the
WWP texts might include examining the language of
specific genres and structures, possibly in relation
to other information axes (e.g. time, geography). For
example, how does the language of lyric poetry change
during the course of the long 18th century? How do

4. Conclusion
The primary outcome of this exploration is a set of
SEASR components designed to extract and process
many commonly encoded semantic features using the
TEI P5 Guidelines. This poster session will include
a demonstration of the TEI tools for SEASR, as
well as a discussion of the challenges of developing
broadly applicable scholarly software tools such as
these. Specifically, it will examine the difficulties and
opportunities in designing software to work within a
broad and diverse community of practice, such as
the TEI community. The software, along with a set of
sample analyses, will be available for download in a
publicly available repository. In addition, a white paper,
including an analysis of likely use-cases for these tools,
will be available at the conclusion of the grant.

Extending the Life of the
Broadside Ballad: The English
Broadside Ballad Archive from
Microfilm to Color Photography
Becker, Charlotte

becker.charlotte@gmail.com
University of California, Santa Barbara

Meyer, Shannon

meyer.shannon@gmail.com
University of California, Santa Barbara

The English Broadside Ballad Archive (EBBA) is a
digital archive housed in the English Department
of the University of California, Santa Barbara
(http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu), under the direction of
Professor Patricia Fumerton, and with funding from
three NEH Reference Materials Grants (2006-8,
2008-10, and 2010-12). English broadside ballads
were mass printed from the sixteenth through
the ninenteenth century; in their “heyday” of
the seventeenth century, they were multimedia
productions that included woodcut images, a poem,
and the title of a popular tune, to which the poem could
be sung. The goal of the EBBA project is to recreate
for users the lively interaction with these multimedia
artifacts that approximates how early modern people
might have encountered them at the height of their
popularity. The EBBA archive is especially important
because the surviving artifacts are extremely fragile
and in most cases inaccessible to scholars, let
alone the general public. The EBBA website provides
facsimile images of the broadsides as they would
have appeared when printed, transcriptions of the
poem, facsimile transcriptions displaying the poem in
the context of the original broadside but rendered in
modern type, and audio recordings of the ballads being
sung. Thanks to color images of ballad collections
that EBBA has acquired during the past year, the
EBBA team has begun to add another layer to the
archive: now, in addition to reflecting the early modern
experience with the ballads, EBBA can display the
ballads as they appear in collections today.
We propose a multimedia poster presentation
demonstrating the long-standing features of EBBA,
and highlighting our recent acquisition of color images
of the Roxburghe ballad collection through a contract
with the British Library. At the British Library, the

272

albums that comprise the Roxburghe collection are not
made available to the public or even to most scholars
because of their fragile condition; however, the texts
in the collection remain highly important to scholars
because they offer particular insight into early modern
popular culture and demonstrate developments in
print culture over the three centuries during which
the collected ballads were printed and circulated.
EBBA’s acquisition, manipulation, and mounting of the
Roxburghe color images is exciting and challenging
from both the user and developer points of view, and
will be the focus of our presentation.
For scholarly users of the site, these photographs
are important because they show the results
of the collection process. In the case of the
Roxburghe collection, this process often involved
cutting broadsheets in half and pasting the halves
into albums, with the two sides of the ballad either
on facing pages or one side above the other on a
single page. Sometimes ballads were pasted sideways
into the album, uncut and folded at the edges to fit
inside the closed album. EBBA has previously, for the
collection of Pepys ballads, offered microfilm-based
black and white images (called “ballad facsimiles”
on our site) to simulate the appearance of the
original whole broadside. But adding color images and
“album facsimiles,” as in the case of the Roxburghe
collection, helps EBBA give users a better sense
of the long life and changing cultural contexts of
broadside ballads. One aspect of this long life is
the handwritten emendations made by collectors and
overzealous antiquarians. Whether commentary or
additions that assist in reading the ballad, these
emendations are an essential part of understanding
the reception and use of the artifacts over time. EBBA’s
text transcription rules are geared toward providing
a searchable, readable text of each ballad as it was
originally printed, yet the EBBA team wanted to ensure
that the prolific and often illuminating handwriting in
the Roxburghe collection could be accessed by users.
The color images capture the physical object in great
detail, rendering the handwriting entirely visible and
accessible to scholars wishing to read it; thus, users
can now see this important feature of the Roxburge
ballads for themselves.
As our presentation will show, these color images have
been a unique opportunity for the EBBA team to think
about our responsibility to present these artifacts in
a way that balances scholarly utility, visual fidelity,
and the EBBA site’s technical capability. The British
Library’s “Turning the Pages” software and Virtual
Books webpage is a well-known example of the kind
of virtual access to textual artifacts that we aim to

Digital Humanities 2011

provide; however, the nature of the Roxburghe albums
makes such a presentation particularly challenging.
We are dealing with albums where the ballads were
arranged in unpredictable ways when collected, where
page discoloration makes aesthetic uniformity difficult
to achieve, and where parts of the ballads are often
obscured or distorted by folding or insertion in the
albums’ gutter. In addition to finding ways to account
for these visual aberrations, the EBBA team spent a
great deal of time deliberating over optimal file size
for image delivery and attempting to find the most
advantageous balance between server speed and
image detail. These practices and decisions are crucial
ones as EBBA continues to acquire color images of
other ballads, including the Euing collection from the
University of Glasgow, and the Britwell ballads from the
Huntington Library.
Given the irregular and sometimes haphazard nature
of ballad collection, decisions such as these will
continue to face the EBBA team as the project
moves forward with these and hopefully other extant
collections in the future. We are excited to share
EBBA’s progress, as well as our dynamic process of
decision making, as we continue to make early modern
broadside ballads available to the public.

Virtual Touch. Towards an

The term 'haptics' encompasses two areas of study:
human and machine haptics. The first relates to
the study of the perception of the world through
the sense of touch. It includes proprioception (one’s
awareness of one’s own body position in space) as
well as cutaneous information (one’s awareness of skin
deformations). Machine haptics relates to the design
and development of devices that simulate the haptic
properties of physical objects. In principle, they are
incorporated in virtual environments and allow users to
experience tactile properties of virtual objects such as
size, shape, weight, compliance and texture.

2. Virtual Artefact. A Different Approach
The virtual artefact has firmly established itself as
a research tool within several disciplines of the
Arts and Humanities. Many art and material culture
historians and professionals rely on digital records and
visualisations of artefacts in their research, teaching
and practice. We have witnessed, from the 1990s
onwards, how the virtual artefact has increasingly
become photo-realistic and interactive, and how it
continues to evolve. The virtual artefact can now be
part of a complex, collaborative research environment.
With the enhanced technical specifications comes
the interest in exploring the research potential of
virtual artefacts further. We are here concerned with
enhanced simulation of the real experience of physical
objects through the application of haptic interfaces,
or virtual touch technologies. We believe that the
addition of virtual touch would also contribute to greater
273

Digital Humanities 2011

usability of the existing, often neglected electronic
resources and libraries of 3D artefacts.
Research into the use of haptic interfaces–that is
devices engaging the sense of touch in virtual
environments–in the Arts and Humanities is in
its infancy. Although virtual simulation of physical
touch has resulted in important advances in
other disciplines–such as medicine, neuro-science,
telemanipulation control systems and product design–
the potential of such applications to humanities
scholarship has not yet been explored. Very few
researchers in the Arts and Humanities have had an
opportunity to experience haptic devices first hand and
to develop a critical understanding of such systems
and the perceptual processes involved. There have
been some important and promising developments
in the area of heritage science, such as the Haptic
Museum in the US, being the work of Margaret
McLaughlin et al. (2000) at the University of Southern
California, Annenberg and the Los Angeles County
Museum of Natural History; the Museum of Pure
Form (Bergamasco et al., 2005) and ‘Touching the
Untouchable: Increasing Access to Archaeological
Artefacts by Virtual Handling’ in the UK, supported
by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and
Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

overcome. Yet, the existence of ‘DO NOT TOUCH’
simply demonstrates the visitor’s compelling ‘NEED
TO TOUCH’ the artefact. This need originates from the
fact that the sense of touch can provide us with hapticspecific information about an object such as absolute
size, material compliance, texture, temperature and
weight, which cannot be reliably obtained through
the audio-visual senses. Therefore, a solution which
would allow visitors, curators and researchers in Arts
& Humanities to experience these tactile properties
without compromising the integrity of the artefact is
likely to be very welcome and highly valuable.
The latest haptic technologies can provide a
way forward which satisfies both the visitors’
and researcher’s desire to handle and the
museums’ necessity to conserve collections for future
generations. An early 'proof of concept' pilot study was
conducted with randomly arriving museum visitors,
which looked at the potential for the substitution of real
object handling with touching virtual 3D replicas via a
low resolution, low cost, commercially available haptic
interface (PhanTom Omni) coupled with a stereoscopic
(3D) visual display (Fig. 1).

The authors are investigating certain fundamental
questions:
- Is virtual touch likely to enhance the ways in which
we carry out and communicate research in those
areas of the Arts and Humanities that employ 3D
visualisations of material culture?
- How much do we learn about artefacts by touching
them?
- Would simulating this experience through a haptic
interface enhance virtual fieldwork?
- Who can possibly benefit from this experience and
how?
- If ‘seeing with vision that feels, feeling with fingers
that see’ (Goethe, 1788) is possible, to what extent
can this experience be mediated by a haptic system?

3. To Touch or not to Touch?
A notice ‘DO NOT TOUCH’ is familiar in many
museums and heritage sites and the reasons why
this measure is necessary are commonly understood.
Most museum managers and curators embrace the
notion that touching object collections are important.
However, many of the most tactually alluring artefacts
present conservation problems that are difficult to

The visitor feedback offered interesting insights into
the potential of the haptic display of virtual objects
to enhance the experience of museum visitors by
allowing them to interact with virtual artefacts through
touch. An informal trial with a blind member of museum
staff demonstrated that he was able to identify the
shape of the object and gain some insight into the
surface carving and texture of the object, despite the
real artefact being untouchable. The same portable
haptic system was used in the classroom when
teaching a masters module in Digital Arts and Culture
and received valuable feedback from the students (Fig.
2).

publication of the London Charter for the Computerbased Visualisation of Cultural Heritage (version
2.1, February 2009), is a step in this direction.
Some scholars working in this area claim that their
visualisations of ancient sites re-create the real
human experience of ‘being there’. Some believe
that digital visualisation itself may ‘include sight,
hearing, and potentially in the future, smell, taste, and
touch’ (Mudge, 2011). The lack of tactile experience
is one of the significant issues inherent to digital
visualisation of heritage. In addition, our limited
knowledge of the real-life processes that we are trying
to simulate through the use of digital media is always a
challenge. We need to better understand the perceived
discrepancies between the real object and its virtual
record.

Archaeologists,
art
historians,
restorers,
palaeographers and other specialists who examine
artefacts through touch to assess and authenticate
their material, execution and other tactile qualities,
might also be interested in haptic access to material
ex situ when direct access is not possible. The
capacity of human haptic perception–the ability to
perceive the world through the sense of touch–to
differentiate qualities of material, is incredibly rich and
we learn much about the form and composition of an
artefact from our sensitivity to thermal conduction and
fine surface textural qualities through touch. Current
commercial haptic devices do not make effective use
of tactile (or cutaneous) cues, that is the physical
properties of objects which are perceived through skin
mechanoreceptors. Technologies that do operate at
this level are either experimental, lab-based systems
or, if commercially available, are extremely expensive,
as well as being complex to setup and maintain.
Certain limitations inherent in the whole concept of
virtual representations of objects, notably weight and
balance, which are dependant not on the virtual object
itself, but on the properties of the specific device with
which we feel it, need to be resolved.
The virtual artefact has opened up unprecedented
possibilities for new research into the material
culture of the past. Digital technology supporting
visualisation of heritage is becoming ever more
sophisticated and many projects of this kind seek
to better the accompanying scholarly apparatus. The

4. 'Feeling with a Seeing Hand' (Goethe, 1788)
In the process of gaining knowledge about the real
world, vision allows us to explore the environment
instantly and provides us with information about
object properties such as 3D shape, colour, texture,
condition, relative size, relative distance as well as
events such as motion or changes of all these visual
properties. Even when looking close-up is possible our
knowledge is still incomplete. This is because vision
alone does not allow us to perceive important physical
properties of materials such as weight, centre of mass,
temperature, surface roughness, hardness and actual
size. In order to perceive these properties we need
to engage touch. Touch allows us to perceive the
properties which are essential for effective interaction
with the physical world. By exploring an object through
touch, we can form a better understanding of its
purpose and use, and develop insights to inform us
about its past users. For example, it is not possible
to appreciate the physical endurance of an ancient
warrior just by viewing a shield he might have used. For
this, it is necessary to engage touch: lift and carry it.
Although still relatively primitive (comparing to
advances in visual displays), current haptic interfaces
(HI) allow a range of haptic and tactile interaction with
virtual objects, from the exploration with one or multiple
fingers with one or two hands (Giachritsis et al., 2009;
Giachritsis et al., 2010; Monroy et al., 2008) (Fig. 3) to
more immersive experience involving movements from
arm joints.

275

Digital Humanities 2011

to audio-visual experiences of virtual artefacts. How
much do we learn about artefacts by touching them?
Would simulating this experience through a haptic
interface enhance virtual fieldwork? Who can possibly
benefit from this experience and how? If Goethe's
(1788) ‘seeing with vision that feels, feeling with
fingers that see’ is possible, to what extent can this
experience be mediated by a haptic system? We will
not be certain of the answers, nor have influence
over the future of multisensory computing, unless
we explore whether current developments and wideranging research meets our varied expectations.
Fig. 3 Bimanual manipulation of a virtual object using
precision grip with the haptic interface device Master Finger 2.

Haptic applications vary from simple touch of the virtual
object to real-life probes used as medical or artistic
tools for working on object surface. The extensive
industrial and academic research in advancing HI
shows the impact of these technologies on the way
people learn, train, work and entertain themselves
in virtual environments. Despite their limitations, HI
technologies already offer significant advantages to
users of virtual environments by allowing them a more
realistic interaction with virtual objects.
Recent advances in recording art objects, made
possible by such technologies as photogrammetry,
touch probing and 3D structured light or colour laser
scanning, have augmented the already considerable
body of virtual artefacts, created primarily through
Virtual Reality (VRML) modelling, with records of
unprecedented accuracy. The E-Curator project
carried out by the University College London Museum
Collections and partners, used 3D colour scans of
various artefacts captured with an Arius scanner,
to develop a traceable, grid-based dissemination
and visualisation system. This system enables
museum curators and conservators to identify and
assess objects remotely in a collaborative, networked
environment. The addition of haptic interfaces
engaging the sense of touch seems an obvious future
development. The question is which particular aspects
of human touch these devices should simulate so that
they could be useful to heritage professionals?

5. Towards a Research Agenda for the Arts and
Humanities
If the promise of more intuitive and multisensory
computing–than the one with which we are familiar
today–is real, we should investigate how these future
developments in information technologies may affect
our own disciplines. We argue for the need to explore
the potential benefit of haptic interaction as an addition
276

The authors propose a research agenda in this area
is made from the four positions: 1) digital scholarship
of material culture; 2) the contribution of human
vision and touch in the perception and appreciation
of real and virtual environments; 3) haptic interface
design and applications, and 4) haptic access to 3D
records of art objects within networked collaborative
environments.
The authors seek to investigate the level of interest
of those engaged in historical and cultural studies
in researching the potential benefits of adding
virtual touch to virtual artefacts for the advancement
of cultural heritage scholarship and education.
Expressions of such interest and comments are
welcome.

Improving the AAC-FACKEL, a
Scholarly Digital Edition of the
Satirical Journal "Die Fackel"
Biber, Hanno

hanno.biber@oeaw.ac.at
Institute for Corpus Linguistics and Text Technology,
Austrian Academy of Sciences,Vienna, Austria

In the following a presentation of the latest
developments to improve an existing scholarly digital
edition will be given. The scholarly edition in question
is the AAC-FACKEL, the digital edition of the historical
literary journal "Die Fackel". The presentation will be
devided into three parts representing three consistent
steps in the development. First, the general principles
and the specific edition and design considerations
concerning the online publication of the AAC-FACKEL
will be presented. Second, the particular questions of
editing and exploring this important and interesting
source of literary history of the German language
by means of a sophisticated research tool will be
addressed. Third, a plan and the considerations for
improvement of this successful and widely used online
edition, which is based upon the principles of corpus
research and text technology, will be presented.
The digital edition of the historical literary journal
"Die Fackel" ("The Torch") has been developed in
a collaboration of researchers, programmers and
designers within the framework of the AAC-Austrian
Academy Corpus which is operated by the Institute
for Corpus Linguistics and Text Technology at the
Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna. "Die Fackel"
was originally published and almost entirely written by
the satirist and language critic Karl Kraus in Vienna
from 1899 until 1936. The AAC-FACKEL is online
since January 2007 and offers free online access to
its 37 volumes, 415 issues, 922 numbers, comprising
more than 22.500 pages and 6 million tokens. The
digital edition contains a fully searchable database
of the journal with various indexes, search tools and
navigation aids in an innovative and functional graphic
design interface, where all pages of the original are
available as digital texts and as facsimile images,
which is one important principle of the AAC’s resources
and publication initiatives. The work of Karl Kraus can
be regarded as one of the most important contributions
to world literature. It is a source for the history of the
time, for its language and its moral transgressions. Karl
Kraus covers in his typical and idiosyncratic style in
277

Digital Humanities 2011

thousands of texts the themes of journalism and war,
of politics and corruption, of literature and lying. The
interface provides the scholar with a complex research
environment to read, study and access the texts from
various entry points. The journal comprises a great
variety of essays, notes, commentaries, aphorisms,
poems and other forms. The scholarly digital edition
allows new ways of philological research and analysis.
The presentation of this resource, where the question
of how a valuable historical text source is made
visible and alive in a digital media environment is
addressed, gives insights into the features of the
edition, where the potential of lexicographic word
searches within the various texts of the edition as
well as basic and more advanced elements of the
corpus research approach followed by the AAC is
demonstrated. The research tool offers access to this
resource by means of a multifunctional interface. The
interface has five individual frames synchronized within
one single window. The frames can be opened and
closed as required. The 'Paratext' section situated
within the first frame provides additional information
about the background of the edition and scholarly
essays about the journal. The 'Search|Index' section
gives access to a variety of indexes, databases and
full-text search mechanisms. The results of these
queries and lists are displayed in the adjacent 'Results'
section. A sophisticated 'Contents' section has been
developed in order to show the reader the whole range
of the journal ready to be explored and give access to
the whole run of issues and all of the contents of the
journal in chronological order. The 'text' section has a
complex and powerful navigational bar at the top so
that the reader can easily navigate and read within the
journal either in text-mode or in image-mode from page
to page, from text to text (soon to be implemented),
from issue to issue, and with the help of hyperlinks. The
text can be searched in the following four modes: in full
text search mode, by means of a list of word forms and
of an inverted list of word forms. The functionality of the
indexes and the technical specifications of the edition
are described in the 'Paratext' section on the technical
details. The following indexes are in preparation: an
index of titles including all texts of the entire journal;
an index of errors that were corrected by Karl Kraus in
"Die Fackel"; an index of errors that were not corrected
by Karl Kraus but found and provided with suggested
readings by the editors; an index of variants of Fackel
issues, including the later editions, all confiscated
issues and censored passages as well as the various
regional editions of "Die Fackel"; an index of inserts
including all regular inserts that are considered as part
of the text of "Die Fackel" together with other inserts,
which were added on occasion, as well as additions; an

278

index of illustrations; an index of special issues; and an
index of extra editions, including separately reprinted
articles from "Die Fackel"; finally, an extensive and
complete index of names mentioned in "Die Fackel",
together with philologically sampled additional data,
is in preparation and will consist of personal names,
based upon the material collected by Franz Ögg, but
corrected and largely extended, as well as indexes of
fictitious names, institutions, periodicals, and works of
literature, works of art and so on. The contents list of
this edition is based on the original text titles given by
Karl Kraus in "Die Fackel" and in the separate contents
pages of the quarterly volumes of the journal, which
were collected by the editors of the AAC-FACKEL.
The corpus based research possibilities offered by
this digital edition and its underlying principles will be
dealt with in this presentation. The corpus research
unit at the Institute for Corpus Linguistics and Text
Technology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences
is concerned with establishing and exploring large
electronic text corpora and with conducting scholarly
research in the field of corpora and digital editions.
Among the sources collected by the AAC, which
systematically covers various domains, genres and
types, are more than 500 million running words of
newspapers, literary journals, novels, dramas, poems,
advertisements, essays on various subjects, travel
literature, cookbooks, pamphlets, political speeches as
well as a variety of scientific, legal, and religious texts,
to name just a few forms. The specific principles of
the digital editions are determined by the conviction
that the methods of corpus research lead to valuable
resources for scholars. The AAC has developed model
editions to meet these aims, which provide well
structured and well designed access to the sources,
and will continue to do so by improving existing
editions, thereby contributing to the development of
digital resources for research into language and
literature.

Constructing DARIAH—the eInfrastructure for the Arts and
Humanities

The poster will elicit our vision for the
DARIAH infrastructure and the first steps towards
its implementation. DARIAH (Digital Research
Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities; http://
www.dariah.eu) is a European project funded under
the ESFRI programme (http://cordis.europa.eu/esfri/),
which aims to design a virtual bridge between
various humanities and arts resources across Europe.
DARIAH is currently in its transition from the
preparatory phase to the construction phase, which
will be completed by the establishment of the legal
framework DARIAH ERIC by end of 2011.
Just like astronomers now require a virtual observatory
to study the stars and other distant objects in the galaxy
on the basis of a wide variety of existing observations,
researchers in the arts and humanities need a digital
infrastructure to bring together and collaboratively work
with dispersed scholarly resources (e.g. digital content,
services, methodologies). DARIAH will be such an
infrastructure with a European dimension to support
research practitioners at all levels, from beginners
through to those employing advanced techniques
and methodologies. The grand vision for DARIAH is
to facilitate long-term access to, and re-use of, all
European arts and humanities digital research data
and primary sources.
A typical use case is elicited below (the poster will
present several of such scenarios taken from actual ehumanists Europe-wide)

2. The Digital Postgraduate
Daniela is a postgraduate researcher (PhD candidate)
in material culture at a Greek university. She

holds a first degree in classical archaeology and
a Master's in anthropology. Daniela uses ICT tools
very efficiently and considers them vital for her
research. She is currently researching material culture
and its relationship to the perception of space and
landscape in an area of northern Greece. Her topic
lies within the areas of archaeology and cultural
anthropology; therefore, Daniela's sources include
artefacts, interviews with local people, and extensive
visual material. As her work is largely interdisciplinary
in nature, there is a propensity for making fortuitous
discoveries while looking for something unrelated;
serendipity is very important in her work. This approach
means that she needs to login to different services
simultaneously—even login multiple times a day if
disconnected—and she must keep multiple open
windows in her browser. Furthermore, she must
be able to evaluate the authenticity and value of
any item she discovers. Thanks to the technical
environment developed in the VCCe-Infrastructure
of DARIAH, Daniela benefits from both a single
sign-on environment for accessing all the necessary
digital assets,as well as a virtual portfolio where she
can gather all selected sources. The metadata and
provenance data associated with an item allows her to
evaluate the authenticity and value of an asset, and to
link to related items (e.g. other sources for the same
asset, other formats, research addressing that asset)
once she has found something of interest. From this
portfolio, she can publish geographical views on her
data, which she exchanges and discusses with other
colleagues in Europe.
The mission of DARIAH is to enhance and support
digitally-enabled research across the humanities
and arts. DARIAH aims to develop and maintain
an infrastructure in support of ICT-based research
practices and is working with communities of practice
to:
1. Explore and apply ICT-based methods and tools to
enable new research questions to be asked and old
questions to be posed in new ways;
2. Improve research opportunities and outcomes
through linking distributed digital source materials of
many kinds
3. Exchange knowledge, expertise, methodologies and
practices across domains and disciplines.
DARIAH is also not singly discipline-focused; instead
DARIAH seeks to support all disciplines across the
humanities, encouraging interdisciplinarity and the
exploration and sharing of content, tools and methods.
Research practice in the arts and humanities is
about criticism and meaning, interpretation and re279

Digital Humanities 2011

interpretation, and about extracting meaning from often
incomplete and fuzzy data. It requires researchers
to seek out a wide range of primary and secondary
sources, to organise and structure these, to analyse
and interpret them, and to publish the results. In this
era of pervasive broadband connectivity, the way in
which these processes are undertaken is changing,
and in some cases, the processes themselves are
changing. Increasingly, research practitioners are
using the power of the internet, new tools, and the
range of digital information that is available to them
to create their own personal network spaces, to
digitally publish highly interactive, multimedia-themed
collections (critical editions) of research information
and knowledge, and to visualise and reconceptualise
their interpretations and analysis. New forms of
collaboration are also emerging as the tools available
encourage and enable ‘web-working’ across the globe.
Hence the key strategic aim of DARIAH is to support
researchers in the creation and use of research data
and tools, and to apply and use ICT-enabled methods
to analyse and interpret digital source materials.
DARIAH will be an infrastructure to promote, support,
and advance research in the digital humanities. Digital
humanities is a long-established research field, with
its origins in the Forties of the last century. Over the
past 60 years it has progressed and a large variety
of digital humanities centres and related organizations
have developed. However, we do not perceive the
digital humanities to be a closed field of existing
centres but rather an open and developing research
environment. Everybody interested in using digital
means for arts and humanities research is part of
the DARIAH community of practice. In this view, the
DARIAH infrastructure would be a connected network
of people, information, tools and methodologies for
investigating, exploring and supporting work across the
broad spectrum of the digital humanities.
The DARIAH network will be designed to be as a
decentralised network of competency centres (VCC
– Virtual Competency Centres), which will allow
services to stay close to end-users (researchers) either
geographically or thematically. Common technologies
(e.g. for authentication or federation of archive
contents) and good practices (standardised formats,
digital assets management workflows) will ensure
coherence across the support services offered by the
competency centres.
When DARIAH is operational after the construction
phase, technical products by DARIAH will be manifold:

280

- technological services and tutorials that help existing
humanities data archives to link their systems into
the DARIAH network;
- a package of software and consultancy/training,
which supports emerging data centres in
establishing their own technology environment
quickly;
- an interoperability layer that will connect data
centres;
- means of linking into DARIAH for those countries/
disciplines that do not yet have e-humanities
infrastructure and cannot afford it in the near future;
- best practices and guidelines for individual
researchers that foster data interoperability and
preservation across the DARIAH network;
- a network of expertise linking each scholar to an
active and vibrant community of international digital
humanists.
DARIAH will make an important contribution towards
e-humanities, providing additional services to analyse,
annotate and share arts and humanities research
activities. DARIAH will stimulate and provide expertise
on all aspects of e-humanities, from best practices
for digitisation to metadata standards and advice on
analysis methods and systems.

1. Introduction
This DH2011 paper describes and analyzes the
design process and delivery for The Arcane Gallery
of Gadgetry (AGOG), a “mini Alternate Reality
Game,” that has become the seedbed for a larger
ARG currently under development by the authors
with a planned launch date of spring 2011. With
generous two-year support from the National Science
Foundation (NSF), the multi-disciplinary team is
conducting exploratory, qualitative research at the
University of Maryland on the use and creation of
ARGs as participatory design spaces, information
literacy systems, and vehicles for scaffolding student
learning. The collaborators also include Georgina
Goodlander, Interpretive Programs Manager at the
Smithsonian American Art Museum; and Margeaux
Johnson, Science and Technology Librarian at the
University of Florida.
An Alternate Reality Game is a form of interactive
storytelling whose narrative elements are distributed
over multiple "real-world" platforms, including books,
mobile devices, and networked computers. They often

require participants to solve puzzles, answer riddles,
and track down information in order to advance the
storyline. Examples of popular commercial ARGs
include games such as “The Beast,” “I Love Bees,”
and “The Lost Experience.” Although ARGs have been
used primarily for entertainment, they can also provide
unique and powerful educational opportunities. World
Without Oil and ARGOSI are among the growing
number of ARGs created with educational, “serious
game” goals in mind.
The case study of AGOG focuses on a distinct aspect
of ARG design that is well positioned to benefit
from theoretical insight and methodological inquiry:
namely, embedding counterfactual story bits into a
larger historical framework.
The challenge of counterfactual design is to decide
how to purposefully, meaningfully, and responsibly
depart from the historical record when developing
ARGs within the context of libraries, schools,
museums, and archives--cultural institutions that place
a high value on trustworthiness and accuracy of
information, including digital information. The slippage
between fiction and reality that is the sine qua non
of the genre should be just as much the result of
premeditation as any other aspect of game design. To
that end, we propose a theoretical and methodological
framework for counterfactual design that draws on
the neuroscience research of Ruth Byrne, the objectoriented philosophy of Ian Bogost, and the cooperative
design techniques pioneered by Allison Druin in the
context of Human Computer Interaction (HCI).

2. Design Case: The Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry
(AGOG)
The design attributes of AGOG, a number of which
have already been implemented and play-tested, can
be conveyed in part with the help of scoping notes:
- Place and time period: Civil War and Post-War
Reconstruction United States. While the Civil War
(understood broadly to also include antebellum
and post-war periods) helps anchor the ARG
temporally, geographically, and—if only tangentially
—thematically, these parameters are intended as
guidelines, made flexible by the game’s liberal use
of time slips, motivated anachronisms, and counterfactual scenarios.
- Thematic features: The game includes the following
narrative motifs: historical figures communicating
across space and time, messages and artifacts
intended for posterity, and secret societies whose

members may act as stewards of these informationbearing artifacts.
- Activities, puzzles, and history hacks: AGOG
incorporates
player-created/-curated
artifacts,
scavenger-hunt like missions; information search
and retrieval exercises; and cryptographic
challenges.
- Aesthetic: The game is steeped in a nineteenthcentury retro-futuristic, steampunk style.
- Learning objectives: A primary objective of AGOG
is to use the machinery and conventions of ARGs
to scaffold information and new media literacy
instruction, as well as to teach subject knowledge in
history, science, technology, and math.
- Tools and technologies: The extended version
of AGOG will make use of the technological
affordances of smartphones--such as camera,
phone,
GPS,
texting,
and
web-browsing
functionality--to enhance interactivity and integrate
the offline and online worlds in creative ways.
The game’s mythology is grounded in the history of
the U. S. Patent Office. The Smithsonian American
Art Museum, where Georgina Goodlander works, is
housed in the Historic US Patent Office Building.
During the time it functioned as a “Temple of
Invention” (1836 to 1932), thousands of patents were
submitted, along with miniature models of the designs,
which were put on display. The building also variously
served as a place of employment, curiosity, ministry,
and sociability for a number of historically significant
figures and personalities, including Abraham Lincoln,
Walt Whitman, and Clara Barton. The stately halls
and galleries of the Patent Office were transformed
into makeshift barracks and hospital rooms during the
Civil War, the grim realities of which were temporarily
overshadowed by the repurposing of the space for
Lincoln’s second inaugural ball in 1865.
Collecting all of this historical data in a document,
the design team began looking for events and places
through which it could dig a fictional or counterfactual
tunnel. In 1877, “the noblest of Washington buildings”
was dealt a severe blow when a fire broke out and
destroyed the collection of 12,000 rejected patent
models in the attic and damaged another 114,000. It
is the fire that provided us with the means to traverse
fiction and reality, functioning as a joint in which we
could embed a “rabbit-hole” that would draw players
into the game: a mysterious document allegedly dating
back to the fire of 1877, which cryptically refers
to a “Cabinet of Curiosities.” Out of the notional
fragments of patent models and other mechanical
remains that ostensibly survived the conflagration,
282

players are asked to help reconstruct and curate
the Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry by imagining what
sorts of wondrous, retro-futuristic inventions might
have populated it and then creating those artifacts
using found objects (in the spirit of assemblage
art) that have first been identified in a database
of historic patents. Possible categories of inventions
include but are not limited to communications devices,
weapons and ammunition (think secret Civil War
technologies), cryptographic devices, and medical
equipment. Figure 1 shows the chronological and
conceptual relationships among the factual and
counterfactual narrative elements in AGOG. Other
resources relevant to AGOG, including video footage
of player-created artifacts for the gallery, can be
accessed online at http://www.karikraus.com/?p=69.

factual and counterfactual narrative elements in AGOG.

3. Counterfactual Design
The DH2011 paper triangulates between the
neuroscience research of Ruth Byrne, the objectoriented ontology (OOO) of Ian Bogost, and the HCI
cooperative design techniques developed by Allison
Druin, distilling from them the following set of principles
and practices for counterfactual design.
Cognitive Science: In The Rational Imagination: How
People Create Alternatives to Reality, Ruth Byrne
explores the “faultlines” or “joints” of reality, those
“aspects of reality that are more readily changed in
imaginative thought.” Byrne’s premise is that there are
patterns or regularities in terms of where we locate
those faultlines: some attributes of reality just seem
inherently more “mutable” to us than others. When we
partition, classify, and organize our world, for example,
we readily invent new instances or members of a
category. In the case of AGOG, the design team
identified a real category—patent collections lost (or

Digital Humanities 2011

presumed lost) in the fire of 1877—and created a new
member for it: the Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry.
Object-Oriented Ontology: In his forthcoming book
Alien Phenomenology, Ian Bogost offers a practice-led
approach to philosophy, one that challenges the notion
that the inevitable product of philosophical inquiry is
a paper, article, or book (“Latour Litanizer”). Instead,
Bogost describes and models an alternative approach,
carpentry, which “refers primarily to the construction
of artifacts that illustrate the perspectives [or inner
lives] of objects” (“Latour Litanizer”). As he puts it
elsewhere, “as critics, our job is to amplify the black
noise of objects to make the resonant frequencies
of the stuffs inside them hum in credibly satisfying
ways” (“Interview”). Having co-authored Racing the
Beam with Nick Montfort in 2009—an MIT platform
studies book on the Atari Video Computer System-Bogost compellingly speculates on how carpentry
might help us better apprehend the system’s internal
hardware design: “What’s it like to be a [Television
Interface Adapter]? Or a MOS Technologies 6502
microprocessor? How would one characterize such a
thing? Would it even be possible?” (“Interview”).
The DH2011 presentation describes how this
“pragmatic” mode of OOO might be applied through
circuit-bending—characterized by artists in a popular
YouTube video as “parallel worlds within a circuit”--to
the Arcane Gallery of Gadgetry.
Cooperative Design: Inspired by the prospect of
what we might learn about ARGs and associated
technologies by including children in the design
process, we partnered with KidsTeam at the HCIL
in summer and fall 2010. Adopting an exploratory
question related to AGOG, we asked the children how
they would collaborate with other in-world players,
especially if they had certain in-game constraints, such
as only being able to use found objects or materials
from a certain time period. Preliminary findings suggest
that the joints or faultlines of reality exist across
multiple semiotic domains, and that the gap separating
fiction and reality is often managed through recourse
to metaphor. The DH2010 presentation will elaborate
on these findings and their implications for the design
of tools that support ARGs.

When WordHoard Met Pliny:
Breaking Down of Interaction
Silos Between Applications
Bradley, John

john.bradley@kcl.ac.uk
Center for Computing in the Humanities, King's
College London, United Kingdom

Hill, Timothy

timothy.hill@kcl.ac.uk

College London, United Kingdom

One of the current issues within the Digital Humanities
community is the wish to break down “silos” between
different applications, usually based on the observation
that it is difficult to bring two separately developed
applications together even on kinds of data that they
might ideally actually share. Scholarly annotation and
notetaking has not been often been thought of as
a kind of “anti-siloing” activity, however, they do
involve the juxtaposition of materials and ideas from
a broad range of different sources. In this context
normal web pages and digital applications act a bit
like silos – working against the ability, similar to
what conventional notetaking provides, to juxtapose
materials from different places, and making it difficult
for a computer user to preserve those juxtapositions
that are interesting.
In an attempt to recognise the central role of annotation
and notetaking in scholarship, there has been recent
activity in the Digital Humanities (DH) community to
incorporate Web 2.0-like annotation services within a
number of web resources. We think this is, in fact,
the wrong way to go, and it is our contention that
annotation, in fact, requires a significantly different
approach.
We can see the problem with this “adding an
annotation service” approach if we consider annotation
on paper (see figure 1). When the book reader writes
on the page he combines on that piece of paper
two rather different applications that then must coexist: the print media represented by the printed
word and his/her annotation shown by the handwritten
note. The owner, the technology and purpose of
these two co-existing texts – the annotation and
the print material – are quite different. Furthermore,
whereas the printed text represents an endpoint in

284

the “publishing application” that put it there, the handwritten annotation represents the beginning of an act
of interpretation that is likely to continue into the
future. In some senses, then, a printed page with an
annotation on it represents a nexus between these
two quite different applications: the presentation of
the print, and the support for the annotation made
by the individual reader. The oddness, then, of the
annotation-as-a-resource service in a web resource
is brought into clearer focus when we realise that if
handwritten annotation on a printed page worked in
the way that an annotation service on a website would
operate , it would need to be a service of the book’s
publisher – something that would seem very peculiar,
and, indeed perhaps strikingly inappropriate.

a printed page as the nexus between applications

Pliny (Pliny 2009), as initially installed supports
annotation for web pages, images and PDF
documents. In each of these cases separate miniapplications (one for each data type) supports,
simultaneously, mechanisms to display the object (web
page, image or PDF) and to support annotation of
these objects. Annotation items, although appearing
on the web or PDF page display are also objects that
work in the larger Pliny context as objects in their
own right. Thus, like the printed book, the Pliny screen
becomes the nexus between the “display application”
of the web or PDF page and the separate-but-linked
“annotation/notetaking application”. Furthermore, the
Eclipse platform (Eclipse 2010) on which Pliny
operates already supports the dynamic addition of new
applications into an existing installation. Pliny could
thus be relatively straightforwardly extended to add
support for annotation on other media such as video
or audio, and here again the integration between these
media and Pliny notes would be similar to that provided
in base Pliny.
The purpose of this poster, however, moves on to
a next step in the process beyond the support of
other digital media. Pliny is already equipped to
support annotation of relatively fixed objects such as

Digital Humanities 2011

PDF documents or digital movies. The digital world,
however, is not in fact restricted to the presentation of
relatively fixed media objects but extends to supporting
user interaction with dynamic applications which are
less comfortably considered documents and more
likely to be thought of as tools. Thus, even in the
confines of the WWW with its strong document focus,
DH work often explores how to stretch this documentfocus in the browser to deliver a tool to the user
instead. Indeed, work as diverse as TaPOR (2008)
and PASE Domesday (2010) illustrate this straining
at the constraints that are imposed by the document
orientation.
As a part of Pliny’s so-called “second agenda” (see
Bradley 2007 and 2008), we have also been interested
in exploring the boundary between document and
application/tool in the context of annotation, and we
are doing this work from within the Eclipse plugin
framework where application/tool building is, in fact,
an entirely natural thing. Furthermore, unlike other
application building frameworks, such as Java Swing,
the plugin framework supports the kind of intimate
interaction and co-existence that annotation requires.
In this way, Pliny’s use of Eclipse’s plugin framework
allows us to think of how to support note-taking not
only against fixed digital media, but also against the
dynamic results generated by digital tools.
Figure 2 shows the idea in a stylised form. Here we
see the Pliny application (shown here in green) coexisting with other applications. Two of them (Pliny’s
integrated Web browser, and Pliny’s PDF annotator)
are shown here as orange boxes presenting their
particular digital media objects: a page in a web
browser (at the top), and two PDF documents. The
annotations to these objects are represented here as
the little yellow boxes which, simultaneously, would
actually be visually integrated with their web or PDF
pages, but are also owned by Pliny. The Pliny user can
also use these annotations in the Pliny application as
sources for ideas that inspire him/her to construct new
concepts in his/her interpretation of these materials.
Pliny can represent these new concepts too, and they
are represented in the green Pliny application box as
dark green boxes. Thus, a Pliny item can appear both
as an annotation on its media and also simultaneously
as a note participating in concepts that belong to an
interpretation that Pliny’s user is developing.

Annotation as a kind of "glue" between applications

The “2nd agenda” part of Pliny’s environment is shown
by the bottom two boxes placed on both sides of the
green Pliny box. Here, the objects being annotated
don’t come from Pliny’s initial built-in applications
supporting Web pages and PDF files, but from two
applications that have been added: a Google maps
annotation tool, and an implementation of WordHoard
(WordHoard 2010) which represents a more dynamic
application than the other ones do. The user has
attached annotations to displays created by both these
applications, and these annotations, which represent
observations the user has made while s/he uses these
tools, are Pliny objects (like those attached to the PDF
pages) and can therefore also participate in the work
done by the user within Pliny. Just like notes attached
to PDF pages or web pages, notes attached to displays
by Google maps or Wordhoard can also contribute
materials to the user’s growing interpretation.
We chose to use the funds provided by the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation’s MATC 2008 award to Pliny
(which hereby we acknowledge with thanks!) as a
way to fund a serious exploring of this idea. With
the cooperation of Martin Mueller and others at
Northwestern University we have been exploring what
their WordHoard tool (WordHoard 2010) would be like
if it was presented in an intimately linkable environment
where Pliny operates rather than as a conventional
Java application in which it was originally conceived.
You can see a result of this kind of interaction through
our WordHoard prototype in figure 3. Not only is a
note about the word “shamest” displayed attached to
its occurrence in Shakespeare’s Comedy of Errors,
but there is also a reference to a WWW site that has
nothing to do with WordHoard, but that also contains
the play’s text (with the word spelled differently).

WordHoard and Pliny operating as integrated applications

In conjunction with the work on WordHoard, we are
also extending Pliny's code to exploit Eclipse’s ability to
allow the user to install a new plugin dynamically from
remote online repositories. When dynamic installation
has been added in Pliny. a user will be able to start
with only basic Pliny, but at some point when they
need it be able to add into their environment, say, our
WordHoard application. We expect it will in the end be
no more complex to do this in Pliny than it is to, say,
add Zotero to Firefox. At our poster session the visitor
will be able to see the Wordhoard integration with
Pliny and with other independently built tools that can
interoperate in the Pliny environment. We will illustrate
what the experience is for the user to experience this
kind of integrated environment. For the development
community we hope to speak about the coding work
that this represents and what lessons can be learned
from our experience.

The Wellcome Arabic
Manuscripts Project
Brey, Gerhard

gerhard.brey@kcl.ac.uk
Centre for Computing in the Humanities, King's
College London, UK

suggests that a manuscript should be considered
as a product of craftsmen, authors and readers
and therefore its production, intellectual content and
subsequent use. The description of a manuscript is
carried out having these three aspects in mind, viewing
the manuscript:
1. as a museum object (palaeography, codicology)
2. as an intellectual creation (texts)
3. under historical user aspect (provenance, owners,
editors, etc.)

This poster and software demonstration will present
the Wellcome Arabic Manuscripts project. The aim of
this project was to create a freely available online
catalogue of ca. 500 mainly medical manuscripts
written in Arabic that are preserved in the Wellcome
Library (London, UK). Apart from the actual manuscript
catalogue the outcomes of this project that are of
particular relevance to the Digital Humanities are:
- a TEI/ENRICH based XML schema adapted to
meet the requirements of cataloguing Arabic
manuscripts and in particular to accommodate
detailed codicological and textual descriptions
- an open source,
cataloguing tool

web-based,

customizable

- an online research tool that gives users free access
to a wealth of metadata and digitized page images
of the manuscripts in this collection
- high-quality digital images of each manuscript page
linked to rich descriptive metadata.
The project was partly funded by the Wellcome
Trust and partly by a grant from the UK's JISC
Islamic Studies Programme [Henshaw, 2009]. It is a
collaboration between three institutions:
1. Wellcome Library, London, UK1
2. Bibliotheca Alexandrina, Alexandria, Egypt2
3. King's College London, London, UK3
The Wellcome Library provided the cataloguing
expertise and methodology, the digital images,
and overall project management, while the web
based tools were developed and are hosted by
the Bibliotheca Alexandria. King's College London
(Centre for Computing in the Humanities) managed
the technical requirements specifications for the
cataloguing tool, and adapted the TEI/ENRICH XML
model4.
The cataloguing methodology and the approach to this
project was guided by Wellcome's tripartite approach
to cataloguing Oriental manuscripts. This approach

As a reflection of this approach the manuscripts were
catalogued in much more detail than a typical library
manuscript catalogue, particularly in the areas of the
materiality of the manuscript and the description of
the textual content. In practical terms this approach
-- together with the newly created tool described
below -- allowed the cataloguing tasks to be allocated
according to competence and practicality. The detailed
codicological description, best done on the actual
physical object, was carried out by conservators at
the Wellcome Library, whereas the detailed description
of the textual content (down to the transcription of
chapter headings) was undertaken by cataloguers at
the Bibliotheca Alexandrina.
A key objective of the project was that the encoding
model should follow established standards to ensure
interoperability of the manuscript catalogue and to
make it extendable and as flexible as possible. A model
based on TEI5 and the format used by ENRICH6 (a
European manuscript cataloguing project) was chosen
[Pierazzo, 2010]. The basic TEI/ENRICH model had
to be adapted and customized to accommodate
the needs of the tripartite approach. It had to be
ensured, for example, that the model is compatible
with standards such as Ligatus7, an emerging standard
for the detailed description of book binding features.
Other extensions to the model were needed to enable
the description of the very detailed physical features
from a conservator's point of view, such as flaps,
endbands, or covers. From a more palaeographical
perspective various features relating to the scribe had
to be added, for example an element to describe
the Mistara, an impression on the paper achieved
by applying a kind of stamp that indicated the
lines a scribe would then write on. Other important
palaeographical features that had to be represented
were the coefficients calculated by using the "Pace"
method, a system devised by Nikolaj Serikoff [Serikoff,
2001] to measure certain features of an Arabic script,
such as angles of letters, or the ratio of connected
and unconnected letters on a line. These features
taken together are quite unique for a scribe or scribal
287

school and help to situate a manuscript chronologically
and geographically. In order to adequately represent
the intellectual content of the manuscript, further
adaptations were made. In order to fully represent
compound Muslim names, for example, fields for
their constituent parts (e. g. patronymic, honorific)
were introduced. Additional incipit-like elements were
also needed to hold those formulaic passages at the
beginning of Arabic manuscript texts (the Basmallah,
or Tahmid that superficially look like invocations, but
that also tell about the subject area of the text to follow,
or the origin of the author.
In addition to the cataloguing effort by the cataloguers
at the Bibliotheca Alexandrina, all of the technical
development was undertaken by the Egyptian
partners. The two outcomes of this substantial
development effort are the web based cataloguing tool
for data input and administration by Wellcome and
Bibliotheca Alexandrina cataloguers and the online
research tool that enables scholars and the wider
public access to the rich material via browsing and
searching.
The web-based tool was designed to allow the
cataloguing of manuscripts into valid TEI XML files
without prior specialist XML knowledge. This was
achieved via the development of a Schema driven
editor (SDXE) together with a "configuration grammar",
the XML Skeleton Annotations (XSA) [Aboulnaga,
2010].
The XSA system automatically builds JSF (JavaServer
Faces) based XML editors. These editors in turn
produce schema compliant XML files that follow a
certain XML skeleton. To enable users to author such
XML files, the system generates web forms with fields
for each data holding XML element in the skeleton.
It does this by reading an XML Skeleton Annotations
file (XSA.xml) that contains definitions for each location
in the XML skeleton including a label, a help text,
authority lists, user access rights, and various other
information used by the system to generate the web
forms. The XSA system uses the Schema Driven XML
Editor to generate schema compliant XML files. The
steps necessary to generate a website using XSA are
as follows:
- authoring of an XSA.xml configuration file
- optional creation of facelet templates for look and
feel

possible to adapt the cataloguing tool for any other
similar manuscript cataloguing tasks.
The web based research tool, i.e. the online
manuscript catalogue is directed towards both
specialist and non-specialist use. This means that it
has to provide functionalities that address scholarly
users, palaeographers, conservators, but also a wider
audience whose specialist fields lie in other areas.
The research tool therefore offers entry points into
the repository via multiple levels and access routes,
such as browsing (alphabetic or faceted) or searching
(simple or advanced) for a wide ranging set of criteria.
The advanced browsing and searching mechanisms
take into account features peculiar to manuscripts in
Arabic, for example search by stem or search by root,
differentiated again by normalized character forms or
defective (i. e. dotless) character forms.
During the poster session we will give a live
demonstration of the web based cataloguing tool
and the online research tool. This will showcase the
key features of both applications and highlight the
problems that were encountered and how they were
overcome

This poster will outline the strategies for the
collaborative infrastructure development, still in
progress, of the Canadian Writing Research
Collaboratory (www.cwrc.ca), and the results of these
strategies to date. This project is funded by the
Canadian Foundation for Innovation to provide an
open web-based environment to foster the use of
digital tools and resources for literary studies in and
about Canada. At this point when Canada’s literary
heritage is moving online, management of information
about Canadian literary and cultural history still relies
on tools derived from print models, which cannot
accommodate the explosion of online materials.
CWRC is predicated on the assumption that literary
studies will increasingly shift from the model of
solitary scholars working on small groups of texts,
towards working in increasingly collaborative research
environments, whether as individuals or in teams,
on larger sets of texts. Its infrastructure is designed
to help literary scholars make better use of digital
tools in their use by providing an online environment
developed in response to current research in the
scholarly community.
CWRC is designed around partnerships, whether one
is referring to: system components; the aggregation
and federation of primary and secondary materials;
or the scholarly activity for which the infrastructure is
designed. This project’s infrastructure is a combination
of computing hardware, software, and personnel to
deploy a unique platform, a collaboratory, comprised
of two major elements, a database and a toolkit, linked
through a web-based service-oriented architecture.
This poster outlines the key partnerships built into
CWRC’s development plan, using visual diagrams to
communicate both the system architecture and the
various types of partners and the relationships CWRC
has with the various partners involved in the project.
The infrastructure will launch with its repository
database, Online Research Canada, or ORCA, already

289

Digital Humanities 2011

populated with a body of open access “seed” data
contributed by partners from existing data currently
residing in silos. Some of these projects are longfinished and some ongoing. Federation of data in
related partner projects will expand the body of initial
materials, giving the Collaboratory both a set of
materials on which to test its functionality and a critical
mass of data necessary to demonstrate the potential of
the new research environment to scholars. A number
of partnerships with contributing and pilot projects will
ensure that further data is ingested while the technical
infrastructure is in its early development stages.
The CWRC environment will be designed to empower
online modes of research and collaboration for a
community that is not well versed in such collaboration.
Anticipated components of the CWRC toolkit include:
tools to edit and annotate materials in and (in the
case of annotating) beyond ORCA; aids to discovery,
mining, and visualization of data; and collaboration and
social networking tools. However, with the exception
of search engines, none of these tools have been
adopted broadly within the community of literary
scholars, so partnering with scholars to assess various
tools and select amongst
the various possibilities is key. A new scholars group
will be crucial to ensuring that we anticipate as far as
possible the needs of digital adepts, as well as those
of established scholars. Partnerships with established
tool providers such as the TAPoR portal and with
research projects prototyping second-generation tools
for literary studies are key to ensuring the right balance
of well-tested and emergent tools. More diffuse
partnerships such as use of open-source software are
also fundamental to the design of this project. CWRC is
extremely fortunate to be partnering with researchers
in computing science and other technical fields in the
development of some crucial areas such as role and
workflow management, social networking, and search,
federation, and data mining.

and preservation is fundamental to that planning,

The poster will outline the results so far of this
development strategy, since we will by the time of
DH2011 be in the thick of development work. In so
doing it will assess the challenges and advantages
associated with CWRC’s partner-oriented strategy in
relation to each of these areas, and assess the impact
of this approach on both infrastructure planning and

Interface will be a major challenge, since its design
will likely have a greater impact than anything else
on the degree of scholarly adoption. Our strategy
here is to develop first the fundamental components
of the system—the repository, the editor, and a role

interfaces, and then to work with scholars in our
contributing and pilot projects to develop an interface in
response to user needs, through an iterative process.

The dynasties of imperial China had always had
sophisticated governing systems to run the vast empire
(Chien, 1952). While many of these dynasties left
large quantities of imperial court documents, the
last dynasty, Qing (1644-1911), produced the largest
volume. These documents have been a major source
of primary research material for studying Qing era
China since they provided the most direct and firsthand details of how national affairs were handled.
Among them, two of the most important kinds are
Imperial Edicts (from the emperors to his officials)
and Memorials (reports from officials to the emperor).
The number of Memorials increased significantly after
Emperor Kang-xi (康熙 – reigned from 1662 to 1723)
allowed senior local officials to report to him directly
(Chuang, 1979). The ability for the emperors to obtain
first-hand information directly from local officials was
among the major reasons why the Qing imperial
courts did not suffer as much interference from people
surrounding the emperors, such as eunuchs and family
members of the empress dowagers, as in the previous
Ming Dynasty.
Qing Dynasty had a systematic way to archive official
documents. However, although most of the archives
were organized chronologically, the court documents
291

Digital Humanities 2011

involved in a specific event might span several
months and were often kept in different archives. For
instance, if the emperor received a Memorial reporting
a rebellion in some province, he might decide to
issue an Imperial Edict to give instructions to relevant
officials. The Memorial, depending on its character,
might be kept (or had copies made) in the Archives
of the Imperial Palace (宮中檔), Archives of the
Grand Council (軍機處檔案), or the Grand Secretariat
Archives (內閣大庫). The Edict might have records in
the Imperial Decrees Archives (上諭檔), Archives of
the Diary-Keepers (月摺檔, 起居注), or the Archives of
the Imperial Palace (宮中檔), or the Grand Secretariat
Archives mentioned above. Worse yet, these archives
are now kept at different locations, notably the National
Palace Museum (National Palace Museum, 2001),
the Institute of History and Philology of Academia
Sinica (Institute of History and Philology of Academia
Sinica, 2001), both in Taipei, and the First Historical
Archives of China (FHAC, 1995), in Beijing. Although
digitization effort at the former two institutions made
these archives easier to access than before, it remains
a cumbersome task to collect documents covering the
same event and rebuild their original linkage.
In this paper, we present an approach to restore an
important relation: the citation links among the imperial
court documents. To be more precise, a Memorial
from an official often quotes earlier Imperial Edicts
as the directive for the activities that he is reporting.
On the other hand, an Imperial Edict may also cite
earlier Memorials as the reason for issuing the decree.
In an important historical event such as the Taiping
Rebellion, there may be hundreds of Imperial Edicts
and Memorials that form a complex web of successive
citations. We call such a graph an IE-M diagram. Figure
1 is an illustration.

Fig. 1 An IE-M Diagram

To discover a citation relation we need to first detect
whether a document has cited previous documents.
This problem is similar to plagiarism detection (or
copy detection), which is to detect whether a part of
a document is copied from other materials without
acknowledging the source (Shivakumar and GarciaMolina, 1995; Si, Leong and Lau, 1997; Timothy and
Justin, 2003). However, unlike plagiarism detection for
which an exhaustive comparison among documents
might be necessary, in our case there are often specific
phrases occurred around quotations, which we call
syntactic anchors. In the case of a Memorial citing an
Imperial Edict, the former usually contains an anchor
that starts with adhering to the Imperial Edict (奉上諭)
and ends with By the Emperor Himself. That is all (欽
此). The text in between are quoted verbatim from the
Edict (although usually not in its entirety) (see Fig. 2).
292

Digital Humanities 2011

Fig. 2 In a memorial, the sentences in between the syntactic
anchors are text quoted verbatim from the source edict.

The anchors involved in an Imperial Edict citing
a Memorial may have a number of varieties. The
quotations may also be done in a more casual manner,
since the emperors did not feel obliged to quote
carefully. After identifying the anchor and the quoted
text, our method extracts a segment of the latter (called
signature) and applies a text-matching algorithm to
see if it appears in any document in the database. A
document of the right type that contains the signature
is called a candidate.
We remark that because the quoted text may not
be very precise, a certain degree of fuzziness is
incorporated in our algorithm so that minor differences
can be tolerated. A detailed algorithm is listed in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3 The text-matching algorithm used
for Memorials citing Imperial Edicts.

The comparison produces a list of document,
signature, candidate tuples. We then use metadata
to filter unlikely tuples, and present the findings to
historians for manually validation to ensure accuracy.
The overall process of our approach is shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 The overall process of our approach.

We applied this method to the “Collection of Taiwanrelated Court Documents from the Ming and Qing
Dynasties” corpus in THDL, the Taiwan History Digital
Library (Chen, Hsiang, Tu, and Wu, 2007; Research
Center for Digital Humanities, 2009). This corpus
contains 37,831 imperial court documents of mostly
Qing era that are related to Taiwan. The documents,
mainly Imperial Edicts and Memorials, were selected
from 235 different sources, including the archives
mentioned earlier in this paper. They were chosen by
historians, typed as full text, punctuated, proof-read,
and were supplemented with metadata records (Wu,
2004; Chiu, 2006).
Using the method described above, we discovered
5,403 pairs of citation relations from these documents,
among which 3,947 pairs are Memorials citing Edicts,
and 1,456 pairs are Edicts citing Memorials. By taking
the transitivity on the discovered citation pairs, we
produced 1,258 IE-M diagrams (see Table 1), the
largest of which involves 152 documents.

293

Digital Humanities 2011

Table 2 The main content of the IE-M diagrams sized over 50.
All of them are about major events in the Taiwanese history.

Fig. 3 is an example of such a diagram, in which the
blocks at the top and bottom are Imperial Edicts while
the middle three are Memorials. The arrows between
the blocks indicate citations.
After examining the diagrams, we found that all of the
larger ones (size over 50) are about major events in
Taiwanese history (see Table 2).

Table 1 A summary on the sizes of the 1,258
IE-M diagrams produced by our method.

Tracing through the citations shows the process of
how the Qing Imperial Court dealt with crises occurred
in Taiwan, a far-flung island of the vast empire. For
example, the largest IE-M diagram illustrated how
Emperor Qianlong (乾隆) handled the Lin Shuangwen
(林爽文) Rebellion, the largest civil unrest in Taiwan
during the Qing reign. The diagram vividly reflected
how the rebellion, first dismissing as a minor local
disturbance, developed into an island-wide revolt.
(The rebels even overran a prefectural seat and had
another under siege for more than six months). It also
showed how the local officials, failed at suppressing
the revolt, pointed fingers at each other or reported
false victories. Qianlong finally realized the severity
of the situation and sent Fukangan (福康安), one of
his most trusted generals, to put down the rebellion.
(Qianlong himself considered the pacification of Lin
Shuangwen Rebellion one of his “Top Ten Military
Achievements”.)
In this paper we described an approach to discover
citation relations among Imperial Edicts and Memorials
of the Qing Dynasty. The transitivity closures of
the relations are captured in a concept of IEM diagram, which reveals how a historical event
developed through the correspondences between
the Qing imperial court and the local governments.
Our method demonstrates how to use information

294

Digital Humanities 2011

technology to explore and identify important relations
among historical documents that would be hard to
find otherwise. We applied this method to THDL,
Taiwan Historical Digital Library, and found 1,258 such
diagrams. We should remark, however, our method
can be applied to other and larger corpuses provided
that the full text of the documents are available.
We are currently working with historians to explore
other significant relations to which our method can be
applied.

character animation so that beginners who are
not familiar with Labanotation can study about its
description by a trial-and-error approach.
In this paper, we aim at description and reproduction
of the body motion of stylized traditional dances by
using fundamental elements of Labanotation while
keeping the quality of body movement of CG character
animation. We propose and implement a dynamic
template technique enabling users to notate stylized
traditional dances and reproducing it in 3D CG
animation from a Labanotation score.

2. Labanotation
Labanotation is a graphical notation system for
recording human body movements. Figure 1 (a) is
an example of Labanotation scores corresponding to
dance motion. A Labanotation score is drawn in a form
of vertical staff where each column corresponds to a
body part. Figure 1 (b) shows the basic arrangement
of columns in the staff. The horizontal dimension of the
staff represents the parts of the body, and the vertical
dimension represents time.

1. Introduction
A stylized traditional dance has uniqueness in itself
which reflects history, culture, emotion expression, etc.
When recording and representing this traditional dance
body motions, it is important to have capabilities for
handling these very characteristic body movements,
which can probably be handled with the full-set of
Labanotation (Hutchinson, 1997). However, notation
score becomes extremely complicated, and we will not
be able to comprehend what is that movement.
We are facing a problem how to realize a method
of describing detailed features and nuance of artistic,
traditional dance movements while suppressing the
complexity in notation score.
Several graphics applications has been developed for
preparing Labanotation scores (Brown and Smoliar,
1976; Fox, 2000) and generating body movement
(Calvert, 2007; Coyle et al. 2005; Coyle et al. 2002;
Wilke et al. 2005). However none of them solved the
abovementioned problem yet.
We have been working on a system named
LabanEditor (Kojima et al. 2002; Nakamura and
Hachimura, 2006). It includes functionalities of both
inputting/editing Labanotation score and displaying
296

Figure 1. Labanotation scores; (a) Example of Labanotation
scores and (b) Columns of Labanotation representing body parts.

3. LabanEditor
LabanEditor (Kojima et al. 2002) is an interactive
graphical editor for editing Labanotation scores and
displaying the 3D CG character animation associated
with scores.
We added the new features to LabanEditor as follow:
1. Dynamic template technique enabling users to
notate movements and reproducing it in 3D
CG animation using fundamental description of
Labnotation.

Digital Humanities 2011

2. Motion control module for manipulate the motion
expression among key-frames in order to make the
animation more natural.

3.1. User Interface
With LabanEditor, users are able to input and edit the
score and then display the CG animation immediately,
which makes possible to interactively confirm the
movements. Users can zoom in/out and change the
viewpoint of the 3D scene on all three axes.
While replaying the Labanotation score, users can
observe the animation as well as the red horizontal line
cursor, moving upward corresponding to the animation
progresses, as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 3. Example of LND.

LND describes a pose just like key-frame body
postures for animation, so that we can produce motion
of the body part by simply applying interpolation
between start and end key-frame poses. A key-frame
pose of a body part at a timing corresponding to an end
of the symbol is defined by a Labanotation symbol.
Our system converts direction symbols into animation
key-frames by using a template file for a mapping
between the symbol and its corresponding pose of the
body part.
The template file describes the relationship between
a direction symbol at the particular column and the
rotation and the translation of the corresponding joint.
Figure 4 shows a notation and description in a template
file, and the resulting pose.

Figure 2. CG animation display window.

3.2. Generating the CG Animation
Labanotation scores can be represented as a simple
format called LND (Kojima et al. 2002), which uses
alphanumeric characters to represent basic symbols.
To create 3D character animation, we have to
convert LND into animation data. The format of LND
representation is shown in Figure 3. The lines that
begin with “#” indicate the fundamental parameters
of Labanotation. The movement of a body part
is specified by the line followed by a command
“direction”, which corresponds to the Labanotation
direction symbols.

Figure 4. Relationship between user input symbols and a template
file; (a) User input symbol, (b) Part of a template file, and (c)
Snapshot of the CG animation corresponding to the template in (b).

3.3. Dynamic Template Technique
Due to the rough resolution of fundamental elements of
Labanotation, similar but distinct poses are sometimes
defined with the same symbol in a Labanotation score.
To solve this problem, we invented the method
of dynamic templates in order to represent very
specific movements using the fundamental subset of
Labanotation symbols only. With the dynamic template
technique, we can represent these characteristic
motions by changing the template files dynamically

297

Digital Humanities 2011

during a display process, while using very fundamental
symbols.

the Labanotation score shown in Figure 5(a) will be
interpreted as the LND file shown in Figure 6.

Figure 5 (a) shows the interface of editing template
file. Users can activate the editing window by double
clicking on a Labanotation symbol. For example,
suppose the symbol in the Labanotation score,
indicated by a red color in Figure 5 (a), was selected by
a user, then, the user can directly edit the joint angles
on an editable template panel as shown in Figure 5(a).
Alternatively, the graphically editable template, which
is activated by clicking the „Animate‟ button in Figure 5
(a), enables the user to edit the template by adjusting
the slide bars and observe the resulting pose as shown
in Figure 5 (b).

Figure 6. Example of LND file using dynamic templates.

During the animation process, the Labanotation
symbols, in format of LND, are mapped to the keyframe pose indicated by the current template.

3.4. Motion Expression Control
The motion expression control module controls the
animation of character model from one key-frame
to the next key-frame. We implemented a module
for controlling the motion by applying a non-linear
interpolation, cubic Bezier curve, in order to create
natural movement.
EQUATION (1)
Where f(t) is an interpolated position or joint angle at
time t and a normalized time scaled from 0.0 to 1.0,
respectively. P0(0,0) and P3(1,1) is the start and end
points, respectively, while P1 and P2 are the control
points which can be moved freely as shown in Figure 7.

Figure 5. Interface for editing a template; (a) Template
editing panel and (b) Graphical template editing panel.

The information of template files is inserted into a LND
file corresponding to the start time as shown in Figure
6. The command “#include” determines the template
file used at a particular timing. As a result, in this case,

Labanotation score on the left using Noh (Shitai) template

Labanotation score on the left using standard template.

5. Conclusions

corresponding to the motion expression graphs.

4. Use of LabanEditor for Noh Plays
Noh is the most famous and characteristic Japanese
traditional performing arts in the stylized form of a
musical dance-drama that has been performed since
the 14th century. There are about 240 plays in the
repertoire from five Noh schools (Ortolani, 1995).
Noh body movement is Japanese highly stylized and is
not the same as ordinary human movement. Therefore,
the direction symbols used in Labanotation must be
interpreted differently when we handle Noh plays
and generate body motion from it. This has been
realized by preparing motion template files which are
editable to represent specific motions in that particular
performance.
Snapshots of Noh motion are shown in Figure 9. Figure
9 (a) and (b) show the reproduced animation of Noh
body motion from Labanotation score using the Noh
templates and standard templates, respectively.

In this paper we proposed an approach of description
and reproduction of stylized traditional dances such
as Noh plays with Labanotation. A new version
of LabanEditor, LabanEditor3, successfully describes
and reproduces Noh motions by using the dynamic
template method.
We have obtained a major achievement. Our approach
shows that we can describe and reproduce Noh plays
with the fundamental description of Labanotation, with
a limited number of symbols by using the dynamic
template method.

The Tesserae Project has created a freely available
web tool for analyzing text reuse (intertextuality)
that automatically identifies matching two-word
phrases (bigrams) in Latin poets using one of
two search algorithms. Comparison with the results
of traditional scholarship demonstrates the efficacy,
current limitations, and potential of this approach.
Automatic bigram matching by morphological form
and dictionary headword detects a significant number
of parallels identified by traditional methods. Results
so far do not fully replicate traditional scholarship,
but the incorporation of further feature sets holds
the potential of approaching this standard. Bigram
detection produces more systematic results, permits
large-scale intertextual study, and identifies less
conspicuous parallels.

2. Computational Approaches to Intertextuality
The reuse of elements from other texts has
been understood as a fundamental part of textual
signification from ancient Alexandria to modern times.
Traditional methods of identifying specific parallels
have relied upon the scrutiny and memory of scholars
(Hinds 1998, Edmunds 2001). Researchers have
300

Digital Humanities 2011

recently begun to employ computational means to
facilitate and standardize intertextual study, as well as
to open new perspectives. Two major lines of approach
are phrase (n-gram) matching (e.g. Cummings 2009)
and comparison of element length (Holmes 2010).
In the field of classical Greek and Latin literature,
the Perseus Project has identified five computationally
tractable features, including bigram matches, for
assessing the similarity of phrases in different texts
and has offered a method for cross-linguistic phrase
matching (Bamman and Crane 2008, Bamman and
Crane forthcoming). A program developed by the
eAQUA project locates explicit quotations in the
Thesaurus Linguae Graecae corpus of Greek texts
(Büchler, Geßner et al. 2010).

3. Tesserae Search
The goals of the Tesserae Project are to create a
website that facilitates intertextual search of classical
Latin texts (http://tesserae.caset.buffalo.edu) and to
make computational methods and results accessible to
traditional scholars. The Tesserae group chose bigram
matching as the method most similar to the standard
philological search for parallel phrases.
The tool finds similar phrases by matching two words in
one text with two words in another. Users can choose
two of 26 prepared texts for comparison using one of
two search methods. Version 1 matches two identical
words from each text, in any order, with no more
than four words between them. Version 2 matches
words anywhere in an individual sentence by dictionary
headword using the Archimedes Project Morphology
Service (http://archimedes.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/arch/
archimedes.new.html), and employs an experimental
ranking system to help the assessment of their
potential significance. In both versions, the most
common words are by default excluded to eliminate
potentially insignificant matches. Users can modify
search settings with an advanced tab.

4. Version 1 Test
A Version 1 test compared book 1 of Lucan’s 1st
century CE epic Civil War with the whole of the 1st
century BCE epic Aeneid by Vergil. The resulting 160
parallels were ranked for significance by traditional
philological analysis on a 5 (most significant) to 1
(error) scale. The ranked parallels were compared to
those collated from a standard commentary on Lucan’s
Civil War (Viansino 1995). Tesserae discovered 87
results judged significant (types 5-3) as compared
with 81 of Viansino. Tesserae and Viansino shared
only 14 results in common. Tesserae returned results

distributed more evenly through Civil War book 1 than
Viansino, whose parallels clustered at the beginning
and end of the book.

5. Version 2 Test
Version 2 eliminates errors from Version 1, matches
by dictionary headword rather than exact form to
account for inflection, and takes whole sentences
rather than word windows as the unit of comparison. A
Version 2 test again compared Civil War book 1 to the
whole Aeneid, and the results were measured against
the parallels given by all major Lucan commentators
(Heitland and Haskins 1887, Thompson and Bruère
1968, Viansino 1995, Roche 2009). The expanded
search parameters of Version 2 returned significantly
more results than did Version 1: 2,994 vs. 160. Version
2 produced numbers of types 5 and 4 comparable
to Version 1, but considerably more type 3s, as in
the following table, where the results of commentators
have been collated and graded on the same scale for
comparison.

6. Conclusions
Tesserae fulfills part of its purpose by quickly
generating a convenient list of possible intertextual
parallels for inspection. The combined tests further
demonstrate that Version 1 and Version 2 deliver
comparable numbers of the types of parallels
scholars have traditionally valued, close morphological
similarities of non-frequent words. These results are
illustrated in the following chart.

Parallels between Civil War 1 and Aeneid Found by
Tesserae. Versions 1 and 2 Compared with Commentators

301

Digital Humanities 2011

Although Tesserae found meaningful parallels, it did
not discover the majority of those found by the
commentators. Most undetected matches had features
that Tesserae does not currently recognize, including
similarity of location, meaning, meter, and sound. The
results that Tesserae did find, however, appeared in
patterns resembling those found by commentators.
For example, the commentators found fewer highly
significant reference types in the second half of Civil
War 1 (type 5, 63 vs. 33 in the second half; type
4, 41 vs. 40), and the combined Tesserae results
show a similar, though steeper, decline (type 5, 29
vs. 8; type 4, 30 vs. 27). Tesserae thus supports
the cumulative suggestion of the commentators that
Lucan establishes substantially more highly significant
parallels to the Aeneid in the first half of Civil War book
1 than in the second.

Bamman, D. and G. Crane. Discovering Multilingual
Text Reuse in Literary Texts [forthcoming].

Conversely, Tesserae detects more type 3 references
in the first half of the poem than the second, whereas
the commentators find the opposite (Tesserae: 158
vs. 122; Commentators: 89 vs. 106). One possible
explanation for this difference is that commentators
overlook less significant parallels when there are
more significant parallels in the same vicinity. On this
interpretation, the larger number of significant parallels
in the first half of the Civil War led to a correspondingly
reduced detection of less significant parallels by
commentators, whereas Tesserae detected all types
more consistently. Tesserae search thus serves as a
complement to and check on traditional analysis in
this and other respects, as when in several instances
Tesserae returned more links to a given phrase than
were noted by commentators.

Hinds, S. (1998). Allusion and Intertext: Dynamics
of Appropriation in Roman Poetry.. Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press.

For longer texts, the proportion of insignificant to
significant parallels presented is currently too high
for Version 2 to be fully useful, as substantial time
is required to sort and analyze the results. Future
work will involve developing a system that replicates
the manual scoring used for testing to more easily
identify different types of parallels. Other planned
improvements include the addition of new search
parameters and texts, the addition of Greek and other
languages, user uploaded texts, and the ability to
perform a secondary search for found phrases across
a corpus.

1. Introduction
This poster will provide an overview of the Bamboo
Technology Project and demonstrate some of its
prototypes. We are currently midway through an
18-month implementation phase that builds on
the Bamboo Planning Project – a process that
engaged approximately 600 faculty, librarians, and
technologists from 115 institutions between Spring
2008 and Autumn 2010 – both of which have been
funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
The Bamboo Technology Project (BTP) is a multiinstitutional, interdisciplinary effort that brings together
humanities scholars, librarians, and information
technologists to tackle the question: “How can
we advance arts and humanities research through
the development of shared technology services?”
Comprised of an international partnership of 10
universities,1 the project is devoted to building
applications and shared infrastructure for humanities
research.

2. Structured Work Areas
During the Bamboo Planning Project, we found
that scholar participants repeatedly expressed their
desire for technology that would allow them to
annotate, to collaborate, to gather materials, to
organize information, to share materials, to store
and preserve materials, and to use social media.
Building upon workshop discussions, we identified a
more general set of categories to describe central
scholarly practices in the humanities that could benefit
from technology. Prominent among them were the
practices of aggregation, annotation, consideration,
engagement, and interaction.2 Using these categories
as guidelines, and drawing on the project’s leadership
and participation from different partner institutions, we
organized ourselves into four major interconnected
areas:

3. Structured Work Areas
- Research Environments “Adapters” are being
built that will enable scholars working within the
Project Bamboo Research Environments to access
and apply research tools to dispersed content
collections such as materials in the HathiTrust and
Perseus collections. Research is being conducted to
enable OpenSocial gadgets to be leveraged within
the Project Bamboo Research Environments and
potentially other areas of the Bamboo ecosystem.
OpenSocial is a promising approach to enable us to
develop functionality once and apply it many times.
We are also building a Tools and Services Registry
through which scholars can discover other software
tools that their fellow humanist scholars are using.
- Corpora Space We will carry out a community
design process to plan for a future generation
of corpora-centered virtual research environments
to support the central and growing importance
of data and of corpora curation for humanities’
scholarship. The results of this design process will
be implemented during the second 18-month phase
of the project.
- Scholarly Web Services on a Services
Platform We will model existent digital humanities
applications as web services and then deploy
these or their proxies, and other web services, on
robust platforms to help support many application
developers in the humanities.
- Collections Interoperability We are selecting
and recommending metadata standards for digital
content that will allow for predictable use of important

303

Digital Humanities 2011

scholarly material across all Project Bamboo Work
Spaces and with all Bamboo tools. We are building
an initial suite of adapters and connectors that
facilitate easy, cross-collection use of these “target”
collections within the Bamboo environment: content
from the inter-university HathiTrust repository;
selected content from the Perseus Digital LIbrary;
and 400-years of English texts from the Text
Creation Partnership (TCP). The CI group is
collaborating with other Bamboo working groups and
external experts to identify the most appropriate
standards to implement for both content access and
structural interoperability.

4. Interoperability and Shared Infrastructure for
the Humanities
The BTP is establishing shared infrastructure, in the
form of web services, interoperable collections, and
organizational partnerships to meet the technology
needs of humanities researchers and institutions.
- RESTful APIs Project Bamboo is modeling services
as resources, and will leverage RESTful APIs
to manage these resources across the Bamboo
ecosystem.
- AuthN-AuthZ protocols Project Bamboo will
delegate authentication to established institutional
infrastructure, such as Shibboleth, and to social
media identity providers. Ongoing work with
Internet2 committees such as Shib-dev and
COmanage will leverage edu- space experience and
adopt new and existing software to meet Bamboo's
requirements.

6. Future Work
Our next eighteen-month phase will primarily be
concerned with implementing the Corpora Space Road
Map, which will focus in terms of content on the 450
years of print culture in English from 1473 until 1923,
along with the texts from the Classical world upon
which that print culture is based. As an initial set
of collections, we will be focusing on Perseus, TCP,
ECCO, EEBO, HathiTrust, Google Books, Oxford Text
Archive, and AUSTLit. Although we will begin with
these corpora, we envisage a principle of user-driven
growth. In gathering this material, we will move from
the earlier to the later, because earlier texts pose
more difficult textual and linguistic issues. In designing
protocols that will address these issues of early texts,
we believe we will anticipate most of the difficulties of
the later material.

304

To enable users to work with these corpora, we
will provide tools from the following five classes:
1. Curation; 2. Corpus Search and Discovery; 3.
Collation; 4. Annotation; 5. Analysis/Visualization. We
aim to build a modular environment that will attract
content and collections from providers beyond the
Bamboo partnership, and that will encourage the
broad-based development of tools to operate on the
data.

2. Wandering Jew’s Chronicle Research Archive
Surviving copies of the WJC are scattered: variously
held in the Bodleian Library; the British Library;
Cambridge University Library; Magdalen College
Cambridge, Pepys Library; The University of Texas
at Austin Harry Ransom Library; and the Brown
University Library. The WJC research archive has
created a digital archive in which surviving editions
are united under a single authoritative citation and
represented by:
- archivalquality images
- transcriptions markedup in TEI P5 XML

1. Introduction
This poster will describe and demonstrate work done
in creation of an online archive for research into the
Wandering Jew’s Chronicle (WJC). The WJC is a
printed ballad published between 1634 and circa 1820
which survives in 22 known copies of 15 editions.
These are held in ten libraries in Britain and the USA.
The ballad itself outlines the succession to the throne
of England from William I to a variable contemporary
monarch depending on its date of publication. More
specifically these are from the reign of Charles I
until that of George IV, taking in seven monarchs in
continuations from a core text. The succession of these
monarchs is narrated by the supposedly immortal
Wandering Jew of European legend. There is immense
scholarly interest not only in the subject matter,
but textually in the pattern of variations, the length
and breadth of its publication and distribution. For a
digital humanities perspective the textual history and
relationships pose interesting problems for collation
and textual analysis. Each one of the editions inherits
a basic core text: some of these editions incorporate
common continuations or variations, while others are
textually idiosyncratic. The editions of the WJC are
not only textually but also graphically interesting as
most of the editions are illustrated with woodcuts of
the monarchs described, and while some editions
share woodcuts in common others employ copies
or individual illustrations. Some of these editions are
historically linked to others through relations within
the book trade, while others are unauthorised or
independent printings. The poster and demonstration
will introduce the benefits of having gathered all the
material relating to the WJC in a single place while
demonstrating the technologies used to create the
research archive.

- visualization tools for comparing variations between
texts and images
- bibliographical metadata
- scholarly commentary
It is hoped that by providing all of this in one
location research into WJC can flourish in new and
interesting ways. This resource helps to foster digital
humanities research through tracing and expressing
bibliographical, textual and iconological relations
across a corpus of copies, variant editions, and
versions of ballad texts, including their images and
tunes. It is a valuable resource for those researching
textual genealogy in the earlymodern period. It will
impact the research of scholars of folklore, balladry,
historiography, book history and textual studies.
The WJC research archive is an interdisciplinary
project that touches on literary and textual studies;
art history; historiography; popular culture and folklore;
music and of course the digital humanities. It is
hoped that in addition to its collaboration with the
existing Bodleian Broadside Ballad Database, it will
also collaborate with similar projects for creating digital
archives of other ballads and related texts in a single
coherent manner.
One of the key research objectives in the creation
of the WJC research archive is the development
of a convenient visualization tool for the diachronic
representation and scholarly analysis of a popular
representation of kingship and English historical
continuity. The strengths and limitations for this
purpose of the printed ballad form are of particular
interest. The archive, and associated research, show
both continuities and departures from at least three
other comparable forms: oral kinglists; manuscript
genealogical chronicles; and iconographic picturegalleries. From its first publication (c.1634), The WJC
incorporated uptodate antiquarian research into the
305

Digital Humanities 2011

legal documentary sources of royal legitimacy. The
text may also be framed within the comparative
progress of philological and folkloric inquiry into the
origins of national culture and tradition over its span
of publication. The WJC research archive seeks to
embed this largely forgotten text within a larger history
– of historical writing and memorialising in oral, literate
and visual cultures, between the antiquarianism of the
early seventeenth and the romanticism of the early
nineteenth centuries.

3. Project Outcomes
The main outcome of this project to has been the
creation of an archive of the WJC texttradition that
facilitates the analytical comparison of its text and
images. In one mode, the archive operates as a
paralleltext edition, the usual way of representing
a chronicle tradition in print, but greatly enhanced
by the flexible display options afforded by digital
publication. In particular this allows users to compare
arbitrarilyselected transcriptions, revealing accidental,
typographic and orthographic variation alongside
more substantive literary insertions, emendations
and continuations, including those supplied for
ideological purposes. In another mode, the archive
provides visualizations of surrogate images of original
documents. 2 Certain editions are bibliographically
related through historical relationships within the book
trade, which is graphically revealed through publishers’
imprints and their use of variant states or copies of
the same wooden printingblocks. These relationships
will be stated and made visible to the user, through
a visualisation of the historical sequence of woodcut
images, keyed to corresponding portions of the text.
A second but important outcome has been then
provision of a complete citation of all known versions,
editions and copies of the WJC tradition, creating
common cataloguing standards for ballad texts in
both broadside and chapbook formats that date
from across the period. By drawing from materials
held in various libraries, the project is promoting
the importance of common cataloguing standards,
scholarly collaboration and technical interoperability.
The value of both bibliographically precise and
semantically discerning cataloguing practices is
demonstrated, at a time when the considerable
promise of mass digitization is in danger of
eclipsing the increasingly essential function of the
authoritative scholarly catalogue. The WJC research
archive engages with union catalogues such as
OCLC WorldCat; the English ShortTitle Catalogue;
the NineteenthCentury ShortTitle Catalogue; and is

306

promoting the idea of a common catalogue of British
ballads and chapbooks.

4. Conclusion
While the majority of the technologies used in the
creation of the WJC research archive are mature and
stable applications, in other aspects it has had to be
more innovative in the application and combination of
new technologies and bespoke programming. The use
of lesstraditional digital humanities techniques will be
demonstrated and explained alongside the poster.
It is hoped that in time the archive will be the centrepiece of a number of related projects about WJC.
These include: a study applying imagerecogntion
techniques to woodcut illustrations, in partnership
with Professor Andrew Zisserman (Oxford Visual
Geometry Group); an analysis of the registration and
publication history of broadside ballads; an exploration
of means of visualizing genealogical structure via
earlymodern letterpress technology, in partnership
with Mr. Paul Nash (Bodleian Library); research in
the textual transmission of the ballad; and general
researches in the genealogical and historical culture
of the handpress period (c.14501820). It is hoped that
these projects based on the WJC research archive
will bring together scholars of balladry, book history,
textual studies and digital humanities, and impact wider
audiences interested in history, genealogy, folklore
and popular culture.

Synergies: On the Production
of a Sustainable, Open, ePublication Infrastructure for the
Academy
Eberle-Sinatra, Michael

michael.eberle.sinatra@umontreal.ca
Université de Montréal

This poster will present an overview of Synergies:
The Canadian Information Network for Research in
the Social Sciences and Humanities, a project funded
by the Canada Foundation for Innovation to the order
of $13 millions in their 2007 program ‘Knowledge
Management Resources for the Human and Social
Sciences’. The poster will also offer a progress
report on the technical challenges for harvesting
and displaying various kind of information and data
from across the 22 universities involved in this large
scale infrastructure project as the project enters its
last year of funding. It will be accompanied by a
live demonstration of the web-based search interface
launched in the spring of 2010.
Synergies is a four-year project intended to be a
national distributed platform with a wide range of
tools to support the creation, distribution, access and
archiving of digital objects such as journal articles.
It will enable the distribution and use of social
sciences and humanities research, as well as to
create a resource and platform for pure and applied
research. In short, Synergies will be a research tool
and a dissemination tool that will greatly enhance
the potential and impact of Social Sciences and
Humanities scholarship.
Canadian social sciences and humanities research
published in Canadian journals and elsewhere,
especially in English, is largely confined to print. The
dynamics of print mean that this research is machineopaque and hence invisible on the internet, where
many students and scholars begin and sometimes end
their background research. In bringing Canadian social
sciences and humanities research to the internet,
Synergies not only brings that research into the
mainstream of worldwide research discourse but also
it legitimizes online publication in social sciences and
humanities. The acceptance of this medium opens
the manner in which knowledge can be represented.
On one plane, researchers will be able to take

advantage of an enriched media palette—color, image,
sound, moving images, multimedia. On a second
plane, researchers will be able to take advantage
of interactivity. And on a third plane, those who
query existing research will be able to broaden
their vision by means of navigational interfaces,
multilingual interrogation and automatic translation,
metadata and intelligent search engines, and textual
analysis. On still another plane scholars will be able to
expand new areas of knowledge such as bibliometrics
and technometrics, new media analysis, scholarly
communicational analysis and publishing studies. This
poster will introduce the main goals of the Synergies
project and the impact it will have on the production
and dissemination of Canadian research.
Scholarly research and communication are
undergoing an evolutionary transformation. Research
environments, scholarly communication, knowledge
sharing and services are moving to the digital and
becoming network-oriented. This evolution raises
many new questions about models of knowledge
sharing. Emerging research environments, data
providers, publishers, and libraries will need to develop
and deploy a wide variety of new resource models to
address these new realities. These resource models
will lower the barriers to access and exploitation
of research and information resources, serve the
needs of individuals and both general and specialized
communities, and integrate new models of publication,
annotation, communication and knowledge sharing.
Synergies will provide a needed infrastructure for the
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council
(SSHRC) to follow through its in-principle commitment
to open access and facilitate its implementation
by extending the current venues and means for
online publishing in Canada. With Synergies in place
the funding of journals based on dissemination
effectiveness rather than sales levels will become both
feasible for journals and possible as an evaluative
criterion for SSHRC funding. The Canadian Federation
for the Humanities and Social Sciences, with a
membership of over 30,000, has also adopted a
position in favor of open access and indicate the role
that Synergies can play.
Alongside a new web interface and tools for accessing
information produced in Canada (with the website to be
demonstrated alongside the poster), Synergies will be
a digital publishing platform for scholarly publications,
with its first goal being to offer digital publishing
services prepared to international standards with the
lowest cost possible for the editorial production side.
This project will thus work as a sustainable, open, epublication infrastructure for the academy.
307

Digital Humanities 2011

In sum, this poster will contain an overview of the
project, and progress reports on its five regional
components. Synergies is the result of a collaboration
among five core universities which have been
working together for several years. With each partner
bringing its own expertise to the initiative, a genuine
collaboration resulted in an infrastructure which was
conceived from the start as truly scalable and
extendable. Each regional node ntegrates the input of
current and future regional partners in the development
of Synergies, thus continuing to extend its panCanadian dimension. For instance, the PKP project
is introduced within the broader context of scholarly
communications. The Ontario region is presented as
a case study, with particular emphasis on project
integration with Scholars Portal, a digital library. (The
other three regions will also be included in this progress
report to the Digital Humanities community.)

Stylometry with R
Eder, Maciej

maciejeder@gmail.com
Pedagogical University of Kraków, Poland

Rybicki, Jan

jkrybicki@gmail.com
Pedagogical University of Kraków, Poland

Stylometric studies, in all their variety of material and
method, share two common features: the electronic
texts they study have to be coaxed somehow to yield
numbers, and the numbers themselves have to be
processed with statistical software. Sometimes, the
two actions are two independent parts of a given study.
To give the simplest example, one piece of software
is used solely to compile word frequency lists; then,
one of the many commercial statistics packages takes
over to extract meaning from this mass of words, draw
graphs etc.
This approach works if standard statistical procedures
are applied to the data. For multivariate wordfrequency-based authorship attribution, for instance,
once free AntConc produces word lists with
frequencies, expensive (yet often university-licensed)
SAS, SPSS or Statistica can be used to produce
relative frequencies and correlation matrices thereof,
and one of their many modules can in turn
produce Principal Components (PCA), Cluster (CA),
or Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) analyses. This is
already a very comfortable situation when compared
to what Burrows had to rely on in his seminal work on
Jane Austen’s style (Burrows 1987).
Yet, as stylometrists have begun to produce statistical
methods of their own – to name but a few, Burrows’s
Delta, Zeta and Iota (Burrows 2002, 2006) and their
modifications by other scholars (Argamon 2008, Craig
and Kinney 2009, Hoover 2004a, 2004b) – commercial
software, despite its wide array of accessible methods,
becomes something of a straitjacket. This is why
a number of dedicated stylometric solutions have
appeared, targeting the specific analyses frequently
used in this community.
Hoover’s Delta, Zeta and Iota Excel spreadsheets are
a pioneering and excellent example of this approach
(Hoover 2004b). Constantly developed since at least
2004 (when one of the authors of this presentation
received a CD-ROM with an early version), they have
at least two major assets: they do exactly what the

308

Digital Humanities 2011

stylometrist wants (with several optional procedures)
and they only require spreadsheet software that
has become (for better or worse) the standard on
most computers in the world today. This has been
especially helpful for uses in specialist workshops and
classrooms; the student only needs additional (and,
often, free) software to produce word frequency lists
and he/she is ready to go. Yet Excel imposes one
limitation: it is overkill in terms of memory usage, which
results in the slowness of its processing. Also, the
two-stage nature of the process (a separate piece
of software prepares word lists that can be later
automatically imported into the spreadsheet) might be
something of a problem simply because it would take
an experienced Visual Basic programmer to make
Excel compile the word lists themselves.
In this respect, Juola’s JGAAP can directly import texts
in a variety of formats and perform a whole variety of
authorship attribution tasks with an imposing variety of
methods, statistical approaches and material on which
they are based (Juola et al. 2006, 2008). These can
be further expanded by experienced programmers in
Java.
Java is also the language of another software solution
which takes possibly an even broader approach.
Craig’s Intelligent Archive (in its many flavours), apart
from performing certain stylometric tasks, is also a
corpus organizer; once the initial work of registering
texts is done, it allows a versatile combination of
individual texts and groups of texts (Craig and Kinney,
2010).
A new trend in producing stylometric tools is
associated with R, a GNU project, a language and
environment for statistical computing and graphics
(www.r-project.org) in the image of its commercial
counterpart, S. While it came into its version 1.0 in
2000, it has been used for analyses on language only
recently. Its strongest promoters in this community
include authors of corpus-linguistics-oriented books on
the usage of R, Baayen (2008) and Gries (2009). R has
already been used in authorship attribution research
by Jockers et al. (2008, 2010).

manipulating texts (typically, to produce word lists) all
the way to graphing the results (and that in a great
variety).
These capabilities were put tu use in the study of
Delta’s dependence on studied texts’ sizes (Eder
2010), and on the behaviour of Delta at a variety
of intervals in the word frequency rank lists in a
variety of languages (Rybicki and Eder 2011). The
R environment permitted us to cover huge statistics
at unprecedented rates (often thousands of Delta
iterations per hour in corpora of a hundred full-size
novels). It also permitted us to use other statistical
methods, such as PCA, CA or MDS, or those rarely
used so far in this field – such as bootstrap consensus
trees based on a study of Papuan languages by Dunn
et al. (2005, quoted in Baayen 2008: 143-47). What
is more, the entire analysis – from loading texts to
final results in numeric and graphic form – can be
accomplished with a single script. Our Delta script, for
instance, did all the work: it processed electronic texts
to create a list of all the words used in all texts studied,
with their frequencies in the individual texts; normalized
the frequencies with z-scores (if applicable); selected
words from stated frequency ranges for analysis;
performed additional procedures that (usually) improve
attribution, such as Hoover’s automatic deletion of
personal pronouns and culling (automatic removal of
words too characteristic for individual texts); compared
the results for individual texts; performed a variety
of multivariate analyses; presented the similarities/
distances obtained in tree diagrams; finally, produced
the above-mentioned consensus tree – a new graph
that combined many tree diagrams for a variety of
parameter values (Fig. 1). It was our aim to develop
a general platform for multi-iteration attribution tests;
for instance, an alternate script produced heatmaps to
show the degree of Delta’s success in attribution at
various intervals of the word frequency ranking list (Fig.
2).

The scripts presented in this poster have begun
with the first author’s participation in an R workshop
taught by Gries at University of Leipzig’s 1st European
Summer School “Culture and Technology.” Very soon,
a series of R scripts appeared, targeted at a variety of
experiments with Delta and other distance measures.
Very soon, too, it became evident that R is capable
of processing texts and statistics in a fraction of the
time needed by other tools. Also, R scripts can be
relied on for doing the whole work themselves, from
309

Digital Humanities 2011

Figure 3. The GUI for the R script
used to generate the diagram in Fig. 1
Figure 1. An example of a consensus tree diagram generated by R

What is more, despite the fact that the R environment
might daunt (digital) humanists with its initially steep
learning curve, it soon became evident that readymade tools can be developed to make the full power
of R accessible even to inexperienced users with
its capability of working with Tcl/Tk graphic user
interfaces (Fig. 3) prepared by the second author for
two seminar groups of his MA students, who were
asked to make the switch to R from the more traditional

Pleiades: an un-GIS for Ancient
Geography

Pleiades (http://pleiades.stoa.org) is an open-access
digital gazetteer for ancient history. It has recently
been described in an important report from the
Council on Library Information Resources as a
“prominent digital project ... within the realm of classical
geography.” (Babeau 2010) It provides stable Uniform
Resource Identifiers (URIs) and helpful Atom, HTML,
JSON, and KML representations for tens of thousands
(and growing) of geographic entities. It invites scholars,
students, and enthusiasts worldwide freely to use,
create, and share historical-geographic information
related to these entities via its web application. Built
on the Classical Atlas Project (1988-2000), which
produced the Barrington Atlas of the Greek and
Roman World, Pleiades is co-organized by the Institute
for the Study of the Ancient World (NYU) and the
Ancient World Mapping Center (UNC Chapel Hill). With
fresh funding from the National Endowment for the
Humanities (2010-2013), Pleiades is solving problems
in information design, making more data accessible,
and increasing interoperability with other web-based
resources treating the geographical, textual, visual
and physical culture of antiquity. Our poster, to be
accompanied by hands-on software demonstrations,
will highlight new and ongoing collaborations and
summarize the findings since the publication of
our paper in Digital Humanities Quarterly in early
2009 (Elliott and Gillies 2009) and Elliott’s general
presentation of the project at DH2009 which we
believe are of significant interest to digital humanities
practitioners and scholars across sub-disciplines.
The poster will foreground a unique aspect of
the Pleiades effort: its “un-GIS” approach to
historical geography. Where conventional Geographic
Information System (GIS) data models privilege
geometry – requiring a point, line or polygon with which
to associate such “attribute data” as toponyms, time
periods and the like – Pleiades embraces the inevitable
311

Digital Humanities 2011

sparseness, ambiguity, and contingency of historical
knowledge. Pleiades models historical geography as
a graph of relationships between conceptual places/
spaces, names, locations, and time periods rather
than as layered views of tables containing measured
locations with associated descriptive data fields. We
find that our approach opens up a range of flexible
capabilities not afforded by a traditional GIS approach,
including:

- Digital Atlas of Roman and Medieval Civilization:
http://darmc.harvard.edu/

- Identification and representation of geographic
features that have no known locations, or that can
be located only vaguely, roughly, or in relationship
to each other

- Open
Encyclopedia
of
Classical
Sites:
cf. in http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/ourcommitment-to-digital-humanities.html

- Representation of the connectedness of features
- Change of location or properties of a feature over
time
- Aggregation of temporally varying features into
conceptual places or spaces that reflect ancient
practice or modern scholarly method
- Stable identifiers for features, places and names that
can be addressed directly by other web applications
and cited reliably by students and scholars
The features listed above don’t come for free. They
bring extra complexity, and this additional complexity
might be considered a weakness of the un-GIS
approach (or not, as we’d like discuss with poster
session attendees):
- Vocabularies for describing vague or rough locations
are immature
- Algorithms for reasoning on vague or rough
locations are immature or proprietary
- Relative locations need closure at some level if
analysis is to be permitted, and there is uncertainty
about where to stop
- Vocabularies for describing connectedness are
immature
- Time adds both technical and social complexity;
event-based conceptual models (like that proposed
by Mostern and Johnson (2008) embracing the
inseparability of time and space may be required
Pleiades’ web-oriented approach – especially its
emphasis on stable URIs and multiple standard
formats for content serialization – opens up a
wide range of interoperability options. Current
collaborations in this domain will be highlighted,
including:
- Ancient World Image Bank: http://www.nyu.edu/
awib/

312

- Google Ancient Places: http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/
about/news/332
- Epigraphische Datenbank Heidelberg: http://

ircyr.kcl.ac.uk/

- Nomisma.org: http://nomisma.org/
- Papyri.info: http://papyri.info
- The Portable Antiquities Scheme: http://finds.org.uk/
- PELAGIOS: http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/
At a moment when interest in Humanities GIS is
growing (Rumsey 2009), this poster is especially
germane. Critical engagement with the methodological
and theoretical facilities and inadequacies of GIS is
essential if we are fully to integrate spatial approaches
into the humanist’s toolkit and evaluate the products
of their use in research, teaching and outreach.
The perspective of the Pleiades team is firmly
rooted in practice, arising from extended, hands-on
work with a large, complex collection of historical
information that exemplifies many of the challenges
and opportunities humanists face daily, as well as
hard-earned experience in conventional GIS projects.
We believe that our critique of conventional GIS,
and the alternative approach that has arisen from it,
can inform the design of other humanities projects
and provoke further innovation. Moreover, as the
realization of the Pleiades model has been predicated
upon an embrace of web-based interoperability and
“crowd-sourced” content curation, this poster speaks
directly to the DH2010 conference theme of “big-tent
digital humanities.”

Visualizing Sound as Functional
N-Grams in Homeric Greek
Poetry
Forstall, Christopher

forstall@buffalo.edu
State University of New York at Buffalo

Scheirer, Walter J.

wjs3@vast.uccs.edu
University of Colorado at Colorado Springs

The question of the stylistic integrity of Homer's corpus
is a venerable one. For centuries, diverse models,
subjective as well as quantitative, have claimed to
explain the composition of the Iliad and Odyssey:
some scholars have seen the poems as the work of
a single, literate genius (West, 2001, 3); others as a
collective multitext, the superposition of generations of
continually-changing performances handed down from
one illiterate bard to the next (Nagy, 1996, 107ff.).
Often much of the support for these claims is the
perceived homo- or heterogeneity of the text. What
is at stake in these examinations is larger than a
nineteenth-century romantic notion of the artist and
his genius; recent studies have used the structure of
the ancient Greek epics to examine how cognition
structures spoken poetry, and how the sounds of
poetry in turn give structure to our thought (Peabody,
1975, 168ff.). A connection between low-level phonetic
patterns and larger-scale poetics is not unique to oral
composition, but has been shown to be equally active
in literate authors as well (Brierley and Atwell, 2010).
The work in progress presented here attempts to
examine internal heterogeneity in Homer's language
using the tools of computer-based authorship analysis.
As stylometric tools become finer-grained, scholars
such as Hoover (2007) and Andreev (2010) have
turned their gaze from the characterization of an author
or corpus as a whole to considerations of an author's
stylistic evolution over time, and the differences
between and even within individual works. Previously,
the authors of this poster have used character- and
word-level functional n-grams to compare Homer's two
epic poems to one another and to later written text
(Forstall and Scheirer, 2010a). We have also adapted
the functional n-gram to metrical data (Forstall,
Jacobson and Scheirer, 2010). In the present research,
we attempt to characterize the internal sound structure

313

Digital Humanities 2011

of Homer's epics using functional n-grams at the word,
character and metrical levels.
We ask,
- How homogeneous is the author signal within a large
work?
- Do the areas frequently identified as later additions
stand out?
- Can internal patterns help us understand a poem's
composition?
While statistical studies of Homer have been made
before, it is often difficult for the critic to move
comfortably between the numbers and the subjective
experience of interpreting poetry. David W. Packard,
in pioneering computational work on sound patterns
in Homer, cautioned that "we cannot expect to
identify expressive passages merely by counting
letters" (Packard, 1974). More recently, Marjorie
Perloff, noting that the significance of sound is all
too often overlooked in poetry criticism, has laid part
of the blame on "'scientific' prosodic analysis," which
"has relied on an empiricist model that allows for
little generalization about poetic modes and values:
the more thorough the description of a given poem's
rhythmic metrical units, its repetition of vowels and
consonants, its pitch contours, the less we may be
able to discern the larger contours of a given poet's
particular practice, much less a period style or cultural
construct." (Perloff and Dworkin, 2009, 2) In this
poster we focus on visualizing the data in ways
that bridge the gap between empirical data and the
subjective experience of interpreting poetry. We take
our inspiration from work such as that of Plamondon
(2009) and the online Poetess Archive, which has
shown that innovation in how we visualize data is vital
to connecting computing with humanities scholarship.
In particular, Plamondon used color to represent multiparameter sound data over individual poems, allowing
a subjective appreciation of the poem's structure based
on objective values at a glance.
We divide the poem into samples of various sizes,
and calculate n-gram frequencies for the most common
features. We then use principal components analysis
to concentrate the variance among fewer variables.
The top three principal components are assigned to
three component color channels: red = PC1, green =
PC2, blue = PC3. Each sample is visualized as a color
which simultaneously represents three parameters,
each potentially comprehending the most important
aspects of a much larger feature set. The flow of
sound in the poem may be seen as a gradient with
local and large-scale variation (see Figure 1). As a

314

control, we also treat a text of Homer's poetry in which
the order of the lines has been randomized. This is
in part a response to the sobering results shown by
Eder (2010), who made a strong case that authorship
analysis was unreliable at samples fewer than several
thousand words, and was improved with randomization
in sampling. It may be that smaller samples are less
reliable at the author level precisely because they are
sensitive to internal patterns in the text, which the
randomization should smooth over.
The color gradient produced by this visualization of
PCA is useful to the classical philologist precisely
because of its subjective quality; yet a more definitive
analysis of the epics' internal heterogeneity is also
desirable. Which sections are the "most different"?
Are units which are functionally related, for example
the type scenes which are played out over and
over by different characters (Lord, 2000, 68 ff.),
more consistent than the poem as a whole? Is the
difference between the Iliad and Odyssey greater than
the variation within each poem? In addressing such
questions, the classicist cannot help but be biased:
certain features, certain passages take on prominence
at the expense of others. Here we turn to unsupervised
classification for an answer which encompasses all
of the text at once, and has no literary bias. Using
the same features as for PCA, we now perform kmeans classification for various numbers of categories;
again, the randomized text is used as a control. In
forcing the algorithm to subdivide our sample set into
an arbitrary number of classes, we make no specific
assumptions about the structure of the poem. Instead
we ask, how is variation distributed within the text? For
example, with only two or three classes, we find that
samples from all are relatively evenly distributed within
and between the two poems. With more classes, we
find that some tend to be found more in one poem
or the other in the ordered version of the text, while
in the randomized text samples from all classes are
found throughout. The computer-assigned, discrete
classifications may be arbitrarily assigned to colors,
which are then displayed alongside the continuously
varying PCA data to contrast the more subjective,
human-interpreted view of the poem's heterogeneity
with the entirely objective computer-based analysis.

Community-Based Q&A Board

1. Genesis and Motivation
In late September 2010, the Association for Computers
and the Humanities (ACH), together with ProfHacker,
a technology and productivity blog hosted by the
Chronicle of Higher Education, announced the launch
of “DHAnswers,” a community-based question-andanswer board, at http://digitalhumanities.org/answers/.
With DHAnswers, the Outreach Committee of the
ACH sought to address both an opportunity and a
problem we detected with existing communication
venues for digital humanists, such as Twitter, the
long-standing Humanist discussion list, and individual
blogs. We identified a need for DHAnswers after
observing the burgeoning and helpful “big tent”
digital humanities conversation happening on Twitter
—and the frequency with which answers to questions
posed by members of that community exceeded
Twitter's 140-character limit for tweets, or required
near-impossible sharing of a code snippet. Other
exchanges resulted in extended and hard-to capture
conversational threads, generally lost in a matter of
weeks as older tweets were purged from search
engines. We also noted that many questions asked on
Twitter were more specific than those generally asked
on the Humanist discussion list, or were more basic
than a newer member of the DH community might
feel comfortable posing on specialist mailing lists for
software or standards.

315

Digital Humanities 2011

A small team from ACH and ProfHacker worked
behind the scenes (with most software development
and extension undertaken by the University of
Virginia Library's Scholars' Lab and stemming
from work on a Spatial Humanities gateway site
[http://spatial.scholarslab.org]) to create a useful
communication platform, with pre-defined topic
categories (enriched by input from the Executive
Council of the ACH) to help filter and focus discussion.
In addition to a viable, open-source platform for
discussion, however, this project needed people. We
therefore recruited approximately 25 digital humanities
colleagues from around the world, working in different
disciplines and with differing areas of expertise to test
and cultivate the system. We were mostly concerned
with having a friendly group of people helping to prepopulate the site with sample questions and answers,
who could be at the ready in the first months after
release, to monitor the various notification features
we had set up (RSS feeds, email options, and
automatic Twitter messages) to ensure that questions
were answered promptly and the proper communities
were alerted to relevant discussions. We also asked
these volunteers to help us keep the discourse on
DHAnswers positive and friendly. Thanks to the efforts
of this group, we were able to launch the site with
a small amount of content present in each of the
following categories:

related to the popular WordPress content management
system. With a flexible system for creating new
stylistic themes and adding new functionality through
plugins, bbPress allowed us to create a custom set
of features built upon a supported and extensible
base architecture. To keep the site as lean and
usable as possible, and in the hope of creating a
self-explanatory service, we simplified or removed
altogether a number of features from the out-of-the-box
bbPress application.

- Applications, Tools, Formats

To facilitate fast-paced conversation, we created email
notifications and RSS feeds for all questions and/
or for a selection of “favorite” topics. To reward
regular user involvement, the Scholars’ Lab create
a new plugin to add various “badges,” small medallike symbols that indicate a certain number of posts
made or questions answered, to user profiles. We feel
certain that the robust notification system and subtle
reward mechanism for constructive behavior on the
site spurred rapid growth and a quick response time for
new questions.

- Interfaces, Design & Usability
- DH in the Classroom
- Markup & Metadata
- Programming
- New Media & Games
- Project Management & DH Professions
- and “About DHAnswers”
Reaction to the public release of DHAnswers was
enthusiastic. Within a week, nearly 200 people had
registered for accounts and created nearly 300
responses in the site's question-and answer threads.
One month in, it is rare to see a question go
unanswered for more than a few hours—and thanks to
Twitter integration, many questions garner immediate
response.

2. Technical Implementation
DHAnswers leverages an open-source bbPress
platform, which employs PHP and MySQL and is
316

Given a strong digital humanities presence on Twitter,
integrating DHAnswers with that target community
was deemed imperative to the site's success. We
introduced purpose-built plugins to broadcast new
questions from the @DHAnswers Twitter account,
giving both DHAnswers members and non-members
alike a real-time peek into the ongoing conversation.
Initially, we enabled even deeper integration with
Twitter: site members could tweet a message to
the @DHAnswers account in order to create a new
question on the DHAnswers site. In the end, we
realized that the complexity of rules and procedures
for this connection would require a lengthy, nuanced
explanation to each user. The added Twitter functions
thus ran counter our goal of a straightforward tool
that scholars could easily integrate with their normal
communication methods, and we removed them.

3. Response from the DH Community
The multiple broadcast methods (Twitter, RSS, email)
for new questions and answers helped bring together
what some feel are disparate groups within the digital
humanities: those who are on Twitter and those
who are not. Although Twitter integration is a key
feature of DHAnswers, Twitter participation is not
required of DHAnswers users. Instead of relying solely
on the segment of the DH community on Twitter,
and thereby narrowing our audience rather than
expanding it, DHAnswers has focused on building its
own community: the multiple broadcast methods, our
"reward" badges mentioned previously, the ability for

Digital Humanities 2011

users to select "favorite" posts within the system, and
our administrative caretaking have all worked to create
a community of sharing and mentoring. On more than
one occasion, a new user has come to DHAnswers
to ask a question, never having set a virtual foot
within the initial Twitter community that inspired it
(and never intending to), and has found himself
or herself surrounded by senior members of both
the DHAnswers community and the broader digital
humanities community, ready to answer questions
from all. Contrary to initial expectations, conversations
on DHAnswers have centered on pedagogical and
institutional questions, such as building a Digital
Humanites center or designing a curriculum, rather
than technical inquiries on specific processes. Also,
unexpected disciplines, such as archaeology, have
established lively running conversations whereas more
explicitly digital fields—like media studies—have had
relatively limited involvement.
One of the differences between user interactions
in the DHAnswers forum and within other social
networking spaces is that the inherent expectation
of asynchronous responses allows for fruitful
participation by more users and according to their
own terms of time management. Instead of constantly
filtering an incoming information stream via Twitter,
in which a response more than a few hours later is
viewed as out of date and nearly useless, DHAnswers
participants understand that a threaded discussion
will remain in plain sight for several days, thus
providing the mental space for better discussion.
When comments are added to the thread, the
“freshness” of the thread—as well as the notifications
in place throughout the system—continue to keep the
information in view; this process extends the life of the
question and, in turn, the visibility of the answers. In
addition, we find that users are taking advantage of the
ability to “tweet this question”—re-posting questions
of interest to them on Twitter—and therefore are
helping to ensure that questions get useful answers
and important discussions remain in the public eye.

for December 8, 2010). The value of such insights is
of course moderated by the specific circumstances of
the site, an English-only resource sponsored by two
predominantly North American organizations (ACH
and ProfHacker), with strong links to an existing
Twitter-based community.
In its first month of its existence (essentially October
2010), DHAnswers recorded over 19,000 pages
viewed by some 5,575 visitors from 64 countries (these
data have been collected by Google Analytics and
only include traffic to the main site, not RSS and
Twitter feeds). The geographical distribution indicates
a predominance of visitors from the USA, but also
reveals emerging digital humanities regions such as
Australia and Japan.

Figure 1

Similarly, the geographical distribution of site visits
within the United States can be revealing of regional
activity in digital humanities.

4. Analysis
In the spirit of ongoing attempts to define and describe
the Digital Humanities community (see for instance
Svensson’s “The Landscape of Digital Humanities” in
Digital Humanities Quarterly vol. 4 no. 1, Summer
2010), DHAnswers provides an interesting opportunity
to gather insights about who digital humanists are
and what they do, or at least some of who they
are and some of what they do (see also Bethany
Nowviskie’s article “DH Answers by the Numbers” in
the Chronicle of Higher Education’s ProfHacker blog

Figure 2

Also noteworthy is that in the first month over 250
users have registered to DHAnswers and there have
been nearly 600 posts. The most frequently visited
page, after the home page, is a topic on defining digital
humanities, which further reinforces the community’s
desire to understand itself.

In addition to further analysis of the web logs, we
will spend some time analyzing and interpreting the
actual content of the DHAnswers posts. For instance,
the graph below, generated by Voyeur Tools, shows
that the word “like” was the third most common
content word in all of the posts, and fairly consistently
present across the corpus (the trend column, which
indicates relative frequency by topic). The word carries
several meanings, of course, but a closer examination
of the usages suggests a notable predilection of
digital humanists to express preferences and make
comparisons.

In Digital Humanities circles, we often talk about
collaboration between disciplines, among scholars,
and with technologists. While progress in the field
is nurtured certainly by this type of research,
what of our students? How are we shepherding
Digital Humanities to those undergraduates who
could most benefit from exposure to collaborative
tools or humanities computing strategies? Happily,
HASTAC has been addressing pedagogy, most
specifically with Cathy Davidson's post "Research
is Teaching" (http://www.hastac.org/blogs/cat
hydavidson/research-teaching) and the wildly
successful forum "Teaching with Technology and
Curiosity" (http://www.hastac.org/forums/hastac
-scholars-discussions/teaching-technologie
s). As is evident from the Digital Humanities

Zotero group (http://www.zotero.org/groups/30) there
are some relevant, engaging courses being taught
in and around Digital Humanities. But, how can
Digital Humanities engage with, even alter, traditional
pedagogy?

Collaboration, shared knowledge, open access, extradisciplinarity. These are the major tenets of Digital
Humanities. However, what is missing in this list is
something required of all digital projects: play. Roger
Caillois qualifies this type of unstructured activity as
“an occasion of pure waste: waste of time, energy,
ingenuity, skill” (Man, Play and Games 2001; 6).
This lack of structure, leads to exploration, discovery,
and production of knowledge in ways that were
only imagined twenty years ago. Typically though
we don't allow our students this sense of play in
their traditional studies. Especially in literary studies,
we supply students with the end-product but don't
expose them to the theories and the methodologies
always. We separate those kinds of issues into other
courses (e.g., Introduction to Literary Criticism or
Introduction to Research Methods). When faculty bring
a particular perspective, for example textual studies or
feminist theory, to a classroom setting, the methods for
exploring and discovering aren't exposed to students.

Instead, we're offering them the one big major tool,
close reading, for their arsenal.
Students then live with some anxiety that there's one
way to read a text and, more often, ask "how does
the professor want me to read this?" It becomes
a guessing “game” instead of an exploration and
discovery of the literature. In the final essay, we
expect students to offer a discovery, a research paper,
or an analysis. But, if we haven't exposed them
to the methodology and the theory, how can they
adequately achieve a true exploration of the literature?
In this way, the course becomes a game with an
outcome, consequences, and rigid rules. Using Digital
Humanities strategies, I want to instill a sense, even
if it's artificial, that literary studies are a “free and
voluntary activity, a source of joy and amusement” as
Caillois defines “play” (6).
With this poster, I will explore invigorating an
undergraduate education with a sense of play by
specifically incorporating the major tenets of Digital
Humanities and Caillois' typology of play:
1. Free: in which playing is not obligatory; if it were, it
would at once lose its attractive and joyous quality
as diversion;
2. Separate: circumscribed within limits of space and
time, defined and fixed in advance;
3. Uncertain: the course of which cannot be
determined, nor the result attained beforehand, and
some latitude for innovations being left to the player's
initiative;
4. Unproductive: creating neither goods, nor wealth,
nor new elements of any kind; and, except for the
exchange of property among the players, ending in a
situation identical to that prevailing at the beginning
of the game;
5. Governed by rules: under conventions that suspend
ordinary laws, and for the moment establish new
legislation, which alone counts;
6. Make-believe: accompanied by a special awareness
of a second reality or of a free unreality, as against
real life. (9-10)
Before being able to articulate this type of change
in undergraduate curriculum, I had to understand it
myself. I attended ThatCamp Bay Area in October
2010 to gain some understanding, and, well, to feel
uncomfortable. I wanted to immerse myself in areas
that were not so familiar to me, sessions where I
couldn’t be an authority. The invigorating aspect to
the two days’ of sessions was that no matter how
hard I tried to avoid familiar topics, I found myself
319

Digital Humanities 2011

reflecting on the intersection between my work and
all of the cool, interesting work being discussed.
Steve Ramsay (http://lenz.unl.edu/wordpress/?
p=266) was right; I was prepared to be the dumbest
person in the room, and that prepared me for being
inspired by the cross/multi/extradisciplinary work that
so many people came together to discuss.
Big questions plagued me during and after sessions,
even at the bootcamps. But, these weren’t questions
of despair; rather they were invigorating because they
required that I think about pedagogy and curriculum in
a different fashion, but they were there nonetheless:
How can this apply in the classroom? How can I
teach my students some of this technology without
sacrificing content? Is this the content then in a Digital
Humanities course? What kind of Humanistic inquiry
comes from integrating tools with literary studies? How
can I educate my colleagues about Digital Humanities
using geo-referencing as an example? How can GIS
impact my work on history of the book. But mostly I just
wanted to play with all of the toys in order to explore
what kind of Humanistic inquiry is possible. I wanted
to see what happened when a major corpus of work
was available; what questions could I come up with,
because I don’t have any to start with. Perhaps if I had
a chance to play, though, I could find something.
In one session, Linguist Adita Muralidharan lead
the group through algorithms that could parse ngrams in large datasets. The question came up:
How do you know what questions to ask of such
large amounts of data? For instance, Franco Moretti
and Matthew Jockers' use of massive quantities of
19th-century novels to collate developments in the
genre (http://www.thevalve.org/go/valve/artic
le/from_the_che_text_mining_and_data_digging
_as_the_ humanities_go_google/). While neither

project can search for metaphor, irony, and humor,
I can only guess what kinds of extrapolations could
come out of just fooling around with the data, searches
and results. But, I wouldn't know unless I got my hands
on the tools and the dataset. Can I be allowed to do
research when I don't know what the question will be,
let alone the answers? Playfulness, see?
And this is the crux of the entire weekend – playfulness
and imagination is perhaps something that academics
and scholars have moved away from, something that
is stolen from us as we move into full time positions.
And we've done this to our students in a way.
Over the last two years, I have begun focusing
my teaching on incorporating digital tools into
my undergraduate classroom. This is often a
nuanced decision made in heavy consultation with an
320

Instructional Designer. Now, I teach three kinds of
courses that interact at some level with digital tools,
Digital Humanities and the typology of play:
1. TechnoRomanticism

(http://www.sjsu.edu/fa
culty/harris/TechnoRom_F09/News.htm):
We

create our own digital edition of Mary Shelley's
Frankenstein. Along the way, we create a
collaborative timeline using MIT's SIMILE & Timeline
script (http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeli
ne/). We don't even begin to create a website until
some of the preliminary assignments are done -assignments that look at the construction of this
novel, both linguistically and bibliographically. Every
2 weeks, we held a workshop on some digital
assignment and acquired 1 new skill, not even
necessarily a new tool, but a skill. Even those not
accustomed to posting to forums and blogs got
something out of it.
2. Digital Humanities: The Death of Print
Culture? (http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/harris
/DigLit_F10/Introductions.htm) I'm teaching
this one right now, and we're theorizing all facets of
Digital Humanities while at the same time critiquing
the tools for our thinking and dissemination. We're
in Week 11, and now they're really seeing the
benefits and pitfalls of Digital Humanities. We will
also explore multi-modal arguments, i.e., the video
essay.
3. And a third type of course, one in which
content and Digital Humanities are intertwined
-- the British Literature survey course 1800Present: http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/harris
/BritLitSurvey_F10/Engl56B_Frame.htm

For this course, we're not practicing any Digital
Humanities, but we are looking at Digital Literature
in the continuum of the survey, which is difficult
considering we're still figuring out what that means.
This is a lower-division English major's requirement,
which means students typically haven't had the
requisite course on how to evaluate literature in various
genres.
All three of these courses offer students a sense
of play. The most Digital Humanities-focused course,
the Honors Digital Literature course that I'm teaching
right now, even demands the play defined above, that
unstructured, imaginative playing that happens with
tag or hide n'go seek. In fact, when we started the
section on e-literature, I provided no rules for close
reading; my literature majors hated that and still are
admonishing me for not supplying them with the tools.
This is where English/literary studies have done them
wrong (and me for that matter). We train our students

Digital Humanities 2011

with a set of distinct rules, even asking some of them
to master those rules. And, then and only then, do we
allow them to break those rules. But, what if we never
tell them the rules to begin with? What if we ask them
to play first, explore, discover and then we provide
them with a set of rules? I'm talking about reversing the
curriculum to privilege bottom-up pedagogy.
Though much of this long paper is based in anecdotes
about students enrolled in a large, public university, I
believe it provides evidence of the potential for altering
traditional pedagogy using the very thing that Digital
Humanities encapsulates: play.

Columbia: a Digital Edition
of a Large-Scale Document
Collection

The modern Canadian province of British Columbia
has been inhabited for at least 12,000 years, but
its colonial history begins with the visits of Spanish
explorers, in the 18th century, followed by voyages
by Cook and Vancouver in the 1770s and 1790s.
They were followed by other explorers, and by the
Hudon's Bay Company, which established trading
posts in the region, and became the de facto agents
of British colonization until the formal establishment
of the colony of Vancouver Island in 1849, and later
the British Columbia colony in 1858. The corpus
of historical texts in our collection The Colonial
Despatches of Vancouver Island and British Columbia
(http://bcgenesis.uvic.ca/) currently comprises
over 7,000 documents, and covers the years between
1846, when negotiations began between the Colonial
Office and the Hudson's Bay Company over the future
of the territory, and 1871, when the young colony of
British Columbia became a province in the Canadian
federation.
Our documents have a somewhat troubled history.
During the 1980s and 90s, a team led by James
Hendrickson transcribed this huge collection into
Waterloo Script, to produce a 28-volume print edition,
which failed to find a publisher because of its scale.
After Dr. Hendrickson retired, the markup files were
largely forgotten, until they were rediscovered on an
aging server which was scheduled to be shut down.
At Digital Humanities 2008, we described how we
retrieved the data and converted the Waterloo Script to
TEI P5 (Holmes & Newton 2008).
Since then, the project has given birth to a full-scale
digital edition. In addition to the original transcriptions,
we now have over 18,000 page-images, with more
321

Digital Humanities 2011

being added every week; these are being linked
into the transcriptions at every page-break. We
have also generated several hundred biographies
of people mentioned in the despatches, along with
short articles on nearly 200 places/locations and 100
ships which feature in the correspondence. In addition,
we have acquired digital versions of more than 200
contemporary maps, many of which form part of the
correspondence, and we will be adding many more in
the coming months.

A digitized despatch
A simple despatch

This very short example shows some of the core
features, and demonstrates the typical processes
through which a despatch from Vancouver Island to
London would go. Each despatch received in London
would be logged in and assigned a number, then the
Colonial Office staff would annotate it with a series
of minutes recording their deliberations regarding the
appropriate responses; often, letters would be written
to other departments in the bureacracy requesting
guidance or information, and finally a reply would
be drafted (Hendrickson 2008 describes this process
in detail). At the end of the year, the despatches
would be bound into one or more volumes for storage.
The peripheral correspondence, including enclosures
and attachments with the original despatch, are often
bound up with the despatch itself, and the most
significant have also been transcribed as part of our
collection.
In our web application, we have attempted to
reproduce all the pertinent features of the original text
in a form which makes them more accessible to the
reader, while providing easy access to our database of
information on people, places, and ships:

322

The correspondence itself is rarely less than
entertaining, and frequently exciting; it describes
the difficulties encountered by a small, distant and
relatively unsupported outpost of empire, struggling to
deal with internal conflict, often-hostile First Nations
groups, lawlessness, smuggling, and a somewhat
threatening American population to the south. There
are murders, shipwrecks, gold strikes and adventures
of all kinds. However, the collection presents particular
difficulties for readers, especially non-experts, arising
out of the length of time required for a despatch to
make its way between London and Victoria. Between
the transmission of a despatch and the receipt of
a response addressing its issues and questions, six
months might elapse, and during that time, dozens or
even hundreds more despatches would be sent. As
a result, there is no apparent meaningful sequence
in which to read the documents, as one might read
an exchange of letters between two correspondents
living closer to each other. A good search engine helps,
of course, but we have also tried to provide other
methods for users to navigate through the collection,
through our markup of people, places and vessels.
Each instance of one of these items in the text
is linked to its "biography", and the biography can
retrieve links to every mention of that person, place or
ship anywhere in the correspondence, so it becomes
possible to find paths through the documents based
on these elements. We are also marking up some of
the contemporary maps in the collection, using the
Image Markup Tool, and integrating them with the

Digital Humanities 2011

place database, so that it is possible to jump from the
mention of a place inside a document to a "biography"
of the place, and thence to the specific location of that
place on any contemporary maps on which it appears,
as well as Google Maps.

NeDiMAH a Network for Digital
Arts and Humanities

The entire collection (including the maps) is marked up
in TEI P5 XML, and the web application is constructed
using Apache Cocoon and the eXist XML database.
Our poster presentation will deal with our approaches
to markup, the web application architecture, and
how we have attempted to overcome some of the
challenges inherent in the scale and complexity of the
collection.

1. Introduction
The European Science Foundation has recently
recommended the NeDiMAH Network for funding
through its 2009 Research Network Programme. The
Network will run from June 2011-June 2015, and will
provide a focus for researchers using digital research
methods in the arts and humanities. NeDiMAH will
provide a “methodological layer” to enhance and
add value to infrastructure initiatives, and to digital
collections. Outputs of the Network will provide
evidence of the value of ICT methods for arts and
humanities research. This poster will describe the
Network and encourage wide participation amongst
DH2011 attendees in Europe, and explore pannational collaboration.

2. Aims of the Network
The NeDiMAH Network will examine the practice
of, and evidence for, advanced ICT methods
in the arts and humanities across Europe, and
articulate these findings in a series of outputs
and publications. NeDiMAH will provide a locus of
networking and interdisciplinary exchange of expertise
among the trans-European community of digital
arts and humanities researchers, as well as those
engaged with creating and curating scholarly and
cultural heritage digital collections. NeDiMAH will work
closely with the EC funded e-research infrastructure
projects DARIAH (Digital Research Infrastructure
for the Arts and Humanities, http://www.dariah.
eu ) and CLARIN (Common Language Resources
and Technology Infrastructures, http://www.clari
n.eu), as well as other national and international

323

Digital Humanities 2011

initiatives. The Network will bring together practitioners
to examine the use of formal computationally-based
methods for the capture, investigation, analysis, study,
modelling, presentation, dissemination, publication
and evaluation of arts and humanities materials
for research. This research will contribute to the
classification and expression of ICT methods used
in the arts and humanities in three key outputs: a
map visualising the ICT methodological commons; an
enhanced ICT Methods Ontology; and a collaborative
forum for the European community of practitioners
active in this area. These outputs will serve to formalize
and codify the expression of work in the digital arts
and humanities, give greater academic credibility to
this work, and enable peer-reviewed scholarship in
this area. NediMAH will maximise the value of national
and international e-research infrastucture initiatives by
developing a methodological layer that allows arts
and humanities researchers to develop, refine and
share research methods that allow them to create and
make best use digital methods and collections. Better
contextualization of ICT Methods will also build human
capacity, and be of particular benefit for early stage
researchers.

3. Background
Advanced ICT methods for discovering, annotating,
comparing, referring, sampling, illustrating, and
representing digital content (Unsworth, 2000) can
be found at a key point of intersection between
disciplines, collections and researchers: data-rich
disciplines (e.g. archeology, library and information
science, and musicology) have refined new ICT
methods, and within the data-driven sciences research
methods have emerged around data and information
processes. The use of advanced ICT methods can
effect significant benefits in arts and humanities
scholarship. Humanities research can also benefit from
the significant volume of digital material available to
arts and humanities researchers, the access and use
of which is now being supported by the development
of research infrastructures.
Despite this activity, uptake and impact of ICT based
methods remains fragmented. A recent DARIAH
investigation into research practice and Research
Actors, examining the institutional settings of digital
scholarship in the arts and humanities, has shown
that the use of ICT research methods is often
concentrated in specific academic disciplines, or in
libraries or archives, and there are few opportunities for
transfer of knowledge across disciplinary boundaries.
This creates disciplinary "silos", and communities of
practice tend to develop around disciplines, rather
324

than research methods (e.g., archeological computing,
etc). Reasons for limited uptake and multidisciplinary
collaboration were expressed in the ACO*HUM
report (http://gandalf.uib.no/AcoHum/), and in the
recent evaluation of the UK's AHRC ICT Methods
Network (http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.uk/eval
uation). These indicated that there is an urgent
requirement for an international collaborative effort
to undertake a formal analysis and expression of
the ICT methods that can be used for arts and
humanities research. Computational methods demand
the utmost rigour and precision in their application,
and accordingly, research practitioners working in
the emerging field of the digital humanities have
begun to formalize new theories of the interaction
between content, analytical and interpretative tools
and technologies, methodological approaches, and
disciplinary kinships.
NediMAH will be an interdisciplinary, international
Network of expert practitioners in the digital arts and
humanities with the following objectives:
- To investigate and articulate the use of
formal computationally-based methods for the
capture, investigation, analysis, study, modelling,
presentation, dissemination, publication and
evaluation of arts and humanities materials for
research.
- To facilitate collaboration in this research by:
i.

Building a community of practice that is inclusive
in terms of disciplinary coverage and national
representation, as well as seeking the active
participation of scholars at all stages of the
career cycle

ii.

Developing a framework for common exchange
of expertise and knowledge

iii.

Linking researchers with their peers across the
disciplines

iv.

Enabling participants to develop, share and
refine ICT methods as the core elements of
digital scholarship and articulate these methods
formally

- To map the outputs and findings of these
investigations in two digital resources:
- A "methodological commons" to express disciplinary
commons, partnerships and synergies, and the
potential for cross and interdisciplinary partnerships.
- The ICT Methods Taxonomy:
i.

To build a community knowledge base
by extending the arts-humanities.net and

Digital Humanities 2011

DRAPIER resources across Europe. This
resource will be embedded into DARIAH
beyond the end of the funding period to ensure
sustainability and continued dissemination of
Network outputs.
ii.

To investigate issues related to the scholarly
publishing of ICT methods in the arts and
humanities

iii.

To publish Network research in a series of
books and articles.

4. Network Activities
NeDiMAH has a collaborative structure that is transEuropean, interdisciplinary, and able to leverage
existing nationally funded research and research
support activities that can collectively support the
development of a better understanding of the role
of advanced ICT methods in arts and humanities
research. This will support a series of core
activities and a mechanism for exchange of expertise
and material. These activities include a series
of Methodological Working Groups, convened to
consider specific methodological areas over the entire
duration of the Network. They will investigate the topic
from three areas of scientific focus:
1. Investigating the use of the method and gathering
information about specific projects that use it
2. Analysis of current practice
3. Modelling ways in which the method can be applied
across the disciplines in scholarly practice
Each Working Group will convene a Workshop each
year, a key activity by which advanced methods will be
formalized.

it relies on ontologies, formal representations of a set
of concepts and relations.
4. Information extraction and data mining
Text and data mining can reveal new knowledge
from (usually) larger amounts of textual data
extracting hidden patterns, analysing the results and
summarising them into a useful format.
5. Linguistic Corpora for interdisciplinary research
To study language as expressed in such corpora,
corpus linguistics makes use of methods such as
annotation, content analysis and parsing. Originally
done by hand, corpora are now largely derived by an
automated process.
6. Methods and tools for working with digital
manuscripts and images
Methods include text encoding to image restoration,
and tools for digital editions

5. Participation in the Network
NeDiMAH will invite the broadest participation
from European researchers in the digital arts and
humanities through an open call. The Network also
has a Global Dimension, which would enable the
participation of researchers outside the EU. NeDiMAH
has the full support of the following international
digital humanities organizations: the Allied Digital
Humanities Organizations (ADHO), the Association
of Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC); and
the Association of Computing in the Humanities
(ACH) and CentreNet. Digital Humanities 2011 will
be an important opportunity for the Network to invite
collaboration.

Proposed Working Group topics include:
1. Spatial and Temporal Modelling
ICT methods include agent-based modelling
geo-temporal referencing and predictive spatial
modeling.
2. Information Visualization
Visualisation refers to techniques used to
summarise and present data visually, in a form
that enables people to understand and analyse the
information. Formats can include images (3-D or 2D), maps, timelines, graphs and tables.
3. Ontological methods
Ontological mapping is used to semantically
interrelate information from diverse sources to
represent complex relationships. In order to do that,

1. Introduction
In recent years, there is an increasing use of digital
technology in the study of humanities. Many historical
documents are now digitally archived, enabling further
analysis using computers. There are archives that
are accessible on the World Wide Web, including
Union Catalog of the Collections of the National
Art Museums, Japan (Independent Administrative
Institution National Museum of Art, 2010) and Perseus
Digital Library (Crane, 2011).
Until recently, the storage of historical documents
and data has been the main target of digital archive
research. There are, however, many works that go
on to analyze the content of the historical documents
using text mining techniques. In this paper, we propose
a method of visualizing relationships among historical
persons using personal names and place names
appearing in documents.
326

2. Proposed Methods
We propose two methods to extract and visualize
the relationships among persons from historical
documents. The goal of two methods is to
extract dynamics of relationships among historical
persons. The first method tracks temporal change
in a relationship and visualizes it. The second
method utilizes locational information to obtain latent
relationships among persons based on their spatial
activities.

3. Personal Relationships Using the Cooccurrence Information between Persons
We use three historical documents in Japan,
“Azumakagami”,
“Gyokuyou”
and
“Hyohanki”.
“Azumakagami” is an official record written in
Kamakura period (A.D.1180-1266). “Gyokuyou” is
a personal diary written by Kanezane Kujou
(A.D.1164-1200) in the late Heian period from early
Kamakura period. “Hyohanki” is a personal diary
written by Nobunori Taira (A.D.1112-1187) in late
Heian period. We first extracted persons’ names using
“Azumakagami” and “Gyokuyou” databases (Fukuda,
2002) that contains an index of persons. This is
because in historical Japanese documents, persons
are often referred to using other names besides their
real names. The index of persons includes such cases
also. Since the three historical documents are diaries,
we defined co-occurrence to be the case where two
persons appearing in the same date. We calculated cooccurrence frequencies among persons for each year.

4. Personal Relationships Using the Cooccurrence Information between Person and
Locational Information
In this method, we used “Hyohanki”. In the first step, we
obtain frequencies of co-occurrences between each
person’s name and place names. Since “Hyohanki” is
written in ancient Japanese, we cannot attach partof-speech tags using existing morphological analyzers
that were trained using modern Japanese. We
therefore used pattern matching to find place names
that were included in the dictionary. We used the
“Index of Kyoto’s Place Names” created by Noboru
Tani based on the “Outline of Heiankyo” (Tsunoda,
1994) and “Japan’s Historical Place Names 27: Place
Names of Kyoto” (Hayashiya et al., 1979) as the data
sources for place names.
We use co-occurrence as the indicator of the
relationship between a person and a location. If a

Digital Humanities 2011

person’s name and a place name appear in the same
paragraph, we consider it as a co-occurrence between
the two. Since each paragraph often covers a specific
situation or a topic, we consider it to be a better unit
than dates.
Each place name is considered as a dimension of a
vector space. For each person, we create a vector
having the number of co-occurrences with a place
name as the component. For the similarity measure,
we used cosine similarity.
We use the similarity measure and the result of
clustering for visualization. We used JUNG, a Java
open source library for drawing graph structure.

indicated by the arrow closely resembles that of the
blue allow. The change also matches well with the
historical fact. Transitions in 1187-1190 are different
among two documents. This is assumed to be due
to the fact that “Azumakagami” is a diary written by
the Shogunate side and “Gyokuyou” is a diary written
by the Imperial court side. The relationship between
Yoritomo Minamoto and Yoshitsune Minamoto, who
were both samurai warriors, are probably not described
well enough in “Gyokuyou”.
Figure 2 shows the change in the relationships of
Yoritomo Minamoto and Emperor Goshirakawa to
Yoshiyasu Ichijou for seven years (from 1185 to 1191).

5. Results of Visualization and Discussion
The result of visualizing temporal change in a
relationship
Figure 1-3 show the results of visualization using the
method described in Subsection 2.1. Figure 1 shows
the change in the relationships of Yoritomo Minamoto
and Yoshitsune Minamoto to Emperor Goshirakawa for
seven years (from 1184 to 1190).

The horizontal axis is the co-occurrence frequency
between Emperor Goshirakawa and Yoritomo

warriors) in 1192. The vertical axis is the cooccurrence frequency between Emperor Goshirakawa
and Yoshitsune Minamoto, who is a younger brother
and the archrival of Yoritomo. The arrows indicate
the transition based on “Azumakagami”, while the dot

The result illustrates the change in the relationship
among Yoritomo, Emperor Goshirakawa and
Yoshiyasu. Yoshiyasu is a person who was active on
the emperor side and the samurai side. Therefore, the
relation between Yoritomo and Emperor Goshirakawa
is strong. However, the change is different in
“Azumakagami” and “Gyokuyou”.“Azumakagami” is
the content of the samurai side and “Gyokuyou” is the
content of the emperor side. Figure 2 shows the feature
of two historical documents clearly.

The result illustrates the change in the relationship
among Kiyomori, Emperor Goshirakawa and

emperor side. Therefore, the contents of two historical
documents are similar and the transition of Figure 3
is also similar. The results suggest the possibility of
estimating author's standpoint from the document.

6. The Result of Visualizing Latent Relationships
using Locational Information
Using our proposed method of 2.2, we created graphs
that visualize relationships between historical persons.
We focused on the time range of Hougen Rebellion,
starting in early July 1156 and ending in late July of the
same year.
Hougen Rebellion is a short civil war caused by a
power struggle between Emperor Goshirakawa and
former Emperor Sutoku.
We chose 78 persons belonging to either the faction
following former Emperor Sutoku or the faction
following Emperor Goshirakawa (Hyohanki Reading
Circle, 2007). Most of them are aristocrats and samurai
warriors. It is distinguishable from historical records to
which faction each person belonged to. In “Hyohanki”,
31 of these persons had co-occurrence with location
names. We used K = 3 for K-means clustering and L =
20 for initialization. K is the number of clusters used in
328

Fig. 4. Relationships among persons and historical factions

The number next to the node and the color indicates to
which faction each person belonged to. A node labeled
“1” (box) indicates that he followed Sutoku. On the
other hand, a node labeled “2” (circle) indicates that he
followed Goshirakawa. Lines are drawn when similarity
is over 0.4. Dotted lines indicate similarity between 0.4
and 0.7. Solid lines indicate similarity over 0.7.

next to each node indicates to which cluster the person

extracted using historical documents. The experiment
described in Subsection 3.1 showed that temporal
change of a relationship can be visualized using
change in co-occurrence frequencies. The experiment
described in Subsection 3.2 indicated a strong
correspondence between the factions and the clusters,
indicating effectiveness of using location information
for clustering people.

The Effect of Cheating on Player
Engagement in Video Games
Keenan, Andy

andrewtkeenan@gmail.com
Humanities Computing, University of Alberta

1. Introduction
Creating an engaging video game requires the
appropriate balance between challenge and reward
for players. This balance is known as “difficulty”.
Currently, difficulty is created, designed, and managed
by video game developers. Difficulty is controlled by
fundamental design decisions. For example, in Super
Mario Brothers (NES 1986), Mario has a specific
number of lives. When Mario loses those lives by
making mistakes, the game is over. The difficulty of
Super Mario Brothers is progressing through the levels
without losing lives. The game balances the challenge
of limited lives with the reward of completion. If Super
Mario Brothers failed to find the right difficulty, the
game would be either too frustrating or too easy.
Finding the appropriate level of difficulty for the largest
number of players is an important design decision
made by video game developers.
The purpose of this project is to explore playercontrolled approaches to difficulty in video games.
This project repositions the existing power relationship
between player and developer, where the developer
decides the difficulty. Based on my previous research,
I will be analyzing how cheating allows players
to manipulate difficulty and change the relationship
between player and developer. Cheating enables
players to alter game difficulty, enabling players to
find their own balance between challenge and reward.
This project will provide design recommendations
for the video game industry to re-imagine the
relationship between video game player and video
game developer, empowering the player to determine
the rules of their game play experience.

2. Context
Johan Huizinga argues that play creates a space apart
from normal life. He referred to this space as the
magic circle. While in play, players are subject to
a special set of rules. Play is dependent on these
rules. Participating in play requires all players to enter
into the magic circle and abide by its rules. The
330

stability of the game depends on its rules: “[if] the rules
are transgressed the whole play-world collapses. The
game is over” (Huizinga 1950, p3). Huizinga’s magic
circle requires a second examination in regards to
video games. Allowing players to manipulate the rules
alters the power relationship between developers and
players, which could enable players to create more
engaging experiences.
Several academic studies have attempted to
determine what makes games engaging. Cognitive
research in video games suggests that game
developers must adjust cognitive difficulty requiring
players to change their cognitive model to succeed.
This will keep players engaged by challenging their
cognitive process (Graham, Zheng & Gonzalez 2006).
Other studies found that players require realistic
worlds, intuitive controls, character customization,
exploration, and unpredictability (Wood, Griffiths,
Chappell & Davies 2004). A player-feedback study
suggests that a combination of different intensities of
challenge, combining “hard fun” (complex strategy,
difficult challenges, and powerful enemies) and
“easy fun” (exploration, simple puzzles, and novel
experience) creates an ideal experience (Lazarro
2004). Yet another study argues for the importance
of goal-oriented play with few negative consequences
(Provenzo 1991). More abstractly, play must be
internally motivated, simultaneously transcend and
reflect reality, focus on the process over the result, and
provide safe yet unpredictable experience (Stagnitti
2004). There is a gap in the current literature exploring
the impact of cheating on engagement.

3. Thesis
This presentation explores the relationship between
cheating and engagement in video games. Recent
innovations in video game design allow players to
manipulate game difficulty through time manipulation,
an activity once considered cheating. These time
manipulation games serve as a case-study to examine
cheating and the effect on player engagement.
Manipulating time allows players to control difficulty
and find an iterative balance between challenge and
reward. Players can also create emergent game play
types by deciding what constitutes a meaningful “beat”
of play.

4. Methodology
Using a mixed methods approach, I combined a
heuristic inquiry of games that allow time manipulation
with Foucauldian discourse analysis. I examined the
practice of time manipulation in several console

Digital Humanities 2011

video games including Forza Motorsport 3 (Microsoft
2009); Braid (Microsoft 2008); Skate (Electronic Arts
2007), Skate 2 (Electronic Arts 2009); World of Goo
(2D Boy 2008); Prince of Persia: Sands of Time
(Ubisoft 2003); Demon’s Souls (Sony 2009); and
Madden 09 (Electronic Arts 2008). Heuristic inquiry
is a qualitative research approach concerned directly
with human knowing and self-inquiry. This method
“is aimed at discovering the nature and meaning
of an experience” (Hiles 2008, p389). This is a
departure from mainstream research “in that it explicitly
acknowledges the involvement of the researcher to
the extent that the lived experience of the researcher
becomes the main focus of the research” (ibid). Based
on my experiences with these games, I conducted
a Foucauldian discourse analysis focusing on player
engagement and player empowerment. I analyzed how
activities once considered cheating altered the player’s
relationship to the game.

5. Conclusion
I discovered that player-determined difficulty effected
by level of engagement with the games. By controlling
the game’s difficulty through its interface, the level of
engagement was increased. Manipulating time allows
players to learn iteratively and manage their level of
challenge in the game experience. As an interface
feature, manipulating time encouraged the “flow”
state: Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s theory of optimal
experience. Csikszentmihalyi’s Flow: The Psychology
of Optimal Experience (1990) describes flow as being
completely involved in an activity. Reducing frustration
and allowing players to control their experience by
rewinding time creates this flow state in video games.

Between Close and Distant:
Historical Editing Methods at
Intermediate Scale
Knox, Douglas W.
knoxdw@gmail.com
Newberry Library

Between mass digitization of millions of images and
texts and intensive scholarly work on close digital
representation, in the humanities there are many
collections of texts at intermediate scales that require
their own strategies for management, editing, and
analysis. The Text Encoding Initiative grew out of
scholarly needs in working with digital texts that were
encoded manually with considerable editorial care.
In recent years it has become possible to begin to
address the challenge of working with digital resources
at scales that had been difficult to imagine previously
—a challenge captured in Gregory Crane's memorable
question, "What Do You Do with a Million Books?" 1
More recently Crane seemed to reply to his own
question with the demand, "Give us editors!,"
recognizing the need for new kinds of editing and
scholarship that will combine the strengths of digital
methods and domain-appropriate human judgment 2.
Between markup of single texts and mass digitization
of millions of books, increasing attention is called for at
intermediate scale. The present project is a case study
of one modest example of this sort of work.
At the scale of tens of thousands of texts, manual
editing methods are impractical or not cost-effective,
yet there is often still considerable value in structured
markup to support management, discovery, and
scholarly use beyond what uncorrected OCR or plain
text can support. While this is not in itself a novel
observation, thinking about interpretive issues and
scale in relation to digital editing has in general been
much more developed with respect to literary texts than
it has been for nonliterary historical sources.
The poster will outline some of editing questions and
processes that can arise in applying digital methods
to a large aggregation of related historical documents,
drawing on examples from the Chicago Foreign
Language Press Survey, an NEH-funded project of
the Newberry Library that is creating an electronic
publication and database using relatively simple TEI
structures to represent a collection of thousands of
332

newspaper articles prepared in the 1930s. The original
Press Survey was a project of the U.S. Works Progress
Administration in the 1930s that selected, translated
into English, edited, and organized articles published
in Chicago from 1861 to 1938 in newspapers in twentytwo linguistic and ethnic groups. The project produced
120,000 half-sheets of typescript, recording what we
now know are more than 48,000 articles.
The present-day Press Survey project worked with a
vendor to produce a set of simple TEI transcription
files from images digitized from microfilm by the library
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The body of each article has been transcribed into
paragraphs and occasionally tables, without further
markup below that level. Considerable effort, however,
went into making sure the files accurately capture
the structure of information that constitute metadata
for each article: ethnic group, primary and secondary
subject code classifications, source, date, and title. At
the publication end of the process, web developers
populate a database with metadata drawn from edited
TEI files and create a searchable, browseable interface
for the collection.
Between the vendor's XML and the web presentation
is an essential set of editing tasks. Many editing
steps, beginning with XML validation, apply to single
documents, and scale up through simple repetition,
preferably automated repetition with manual exception
handling as required. Often this is a matter of imagining
what might have gone wrong, and then devising tests
for it. Are any items, pages, or essential data structures
missing? Are there paragraphs that are suspiciously
short? Are there any duplicate values one would not
expect, whether identifiers, file name references, or
page numbers? Is there data integrity in expected
relations between file names and internal identifiers? Is
there the sequential continuity we would expect in any
numbering or other patterns where the sequence of the
original material implies some kind of consistency or
order in metadata fields?
Some of the most interesting editing tasks, however,
are those that relate to the collection as a whole,
and require an iterative exploratory process. The
1930s editors of the Press Survey thought carefully
about their choices and methods in organizing a large
body of material. They invented their own hierarchical
subject code scheme, and the linear arrangement of
the typescript indicates how they prioritized ethnic
groups and primary subject codes over date of
publication and secondary subject terms. They faced
inevitable limitations in trying to managing a textual
database of tens of thousands of records with nothing
more than paper, procedural guidelines, and human

Digital Humanities 2011

attention. For seventy years, in the absence of a
digital representation of the editorial model of the WPA
editors, it was impossible to get a full picture of the
choices they made. Now, with digital methods, we can
better enjoy the benefit of their work and yet also see
the limitations of their methods, even according to their
own intentions, better than they themselves were able
to.
While scholars have made good use of typescript,
microfilm, and digital images, until the Press Survey
was modeled as a database of articles its aggregate
characteristics were obscure. No index recorded
the range and distribution of values in important
metadata fields, including dates and the names of
newspapers and other sources. Creating a digital
representation now requires simultaneous analysis
and editorial decision-making. How often did the
original editors depart from their own advertised
controlled vocabularies? What simple errors should
now be corrected, what normalization of data would
best serve the current digital project? Do the
data structures chosen in anticipation of full-scale
digitization fit what we can now know about the
documents in the aggregate? With an eye to both
central tendencies and odd but perhaps telling
exceptions, how can editing choices mediate a digital
collection for efficient use while also preserving some
necessary kinds of transparent resistance to user
expectations, features that may be essential to its
character as a complex historical primary source?

The poster will be organized around these kinds of
questions and tasks, with a series of illustrative case
studies drawn from Foreign Language Press Survey
documents and data.
Generalizing from this case, the primary point is
that intermediate scale matters in its own right. If a
collection is interesting as such, it will likely require
more than the repeated application of the kind of
editing applied to individual texts, and it may also
require decision-making beyond the methods and
standards designed to provide access to aggregations
at much larger scale. We must be able to see both the
forest and the trees.

Roots of Performatology: From
Uber-Marionette to Embodied
Performative Agent
Maraffi, Christopher

topherm@soe.ucsc.edu
University of California, Santa Cruz

This poster presents humanities research the author
completed in Digital Arts and New Media that has led to
the development of a novel high-level Performatology
approach to designing embodied agents in Computer
Science. Agent research for interactive narrative
and games have incorporated some performative
dramatic theory (Mateas, 2004; Seif El-Nasr, 2004;
Tannenbaum, 2008; Perlin, 1996), but being primarily
influenced by literary approaches (Laurel, 1991;
Murray, 1998; Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969), the focus
has been towards developing a Neo-Aristotelian
Poetics approach to interactive drama. Some agent
work has been done on modeling improvisational
performers from Theatre Arts (Magerko, 2010),
but their micro-agent designs did not incorporate
embodied gesture. Although additional research has
been done on modeling the gesture of professional
speakers for enhancing the personality of embodied
conversational agents (Neff, 2008), little work has been
done to procedurally model professional performers
from the arts to enhance the gestural quality of
embodied agents.
By and large, the emphasis for previous interactive
narrative research has been to provide story authoring
tools rather than tools for embodied performers to
represent their craft in computational media. Avatars,
Non-Player Characters (NPCs), and Intelligent Virtual
Agents (IVAs), all tend to be designed to function
primarily as embodied conversational agents, with
gestural performance being supportive to speech acts
that drive the narrative forward. Thus, interactive
drama in games is in stark contrast to how drama
developed in both classical live theatre and moving
pictures, where gestural performance historically
preceded speech acts, and where physical drama and
visual spectacle dominated textual narrative.
When cinema started, the camera was the entry
point for professional performers to migrate out of the
proscenium and into the screen mediums of film and
animation. Actors effectively digitized their embodied
3D gesture into animated 2D representations that
334

translated their already developed fictive personas into
the plastic time and space of analog media, where
the characters could repeat the original performances
indefinitely, even after the death of the performers.
Multiple takes, editing, and visual effects allowed them
to iteratively improve their linear performances for
audiences. The dramatic personas or icons created by
media stars of the last century arguably eclipse the
narrative elements in any single story, and indicate a
development path for embodied performative agents in
New Media today.

2. From Uber-Marionette to Avatar Theatre:
Imagining the Ideal Performer
Interactive drama has the potential to extend the
actor’s craft further than all previous acting mediums,
but due to a technological divide, actors have been
prevented from playing on the new stage. The current
absence of performing artists in computational media,
as well as the potential solution to the problem in
a procedural performer, was anticipated by theater
practitioner Edward Gordon Craig at the turn of the last
century. An influential British theorist working out of
Florence, Craig self-published his controversial theatre
reformation opinions in a periodical called The Mask
(1907-1929). He advocated the rise of the DirectorDesigner as a visionary artist in charge of all aspects
of production, over both the author and players, and
in this role he faced character believability problems
that caused him to question the viability of the actor
as an artistic medium. Craig particularly struggled
with the unpredictable personalities of live actors in
his productions, which he attributed to a fundamental
problem of belief in the theatre. He conceptualized
the perfect actor as one who had a single-minded
belief in the idea of the character, in the ideal Platonic
sense, which would in turn make the audience believe
in the characterization enough to have an emotional
response (Craig, 1963).
A former actor himself, Craig’s views on acting as a
belief problem was influenced by Neo-classical ritual
acting techniques from masked theatre and puppetry.
These art forms also moved him towards symbolic
gesture, along with contemporary influences such
as the stylized movement of actor Henry Irving and
dancer Isadora Duncan, as well as the anti-realism
of the Symbolists (Ayat-Confino, 1987). His innovative
productions were larger than life spectacles of moving
lights and set pieces, which he intended as a new
type of immersive Kinetic Stage. Since he was working
against realism or naturalism, but still wanted to create
a believable experience for the spectator, designing
a consistent theatrical experience was critical to him.

Digital Humanities 2011

But the one thing Craig couldn’t control was the live
actors in his productions, who he claimed did not have
the disciplined belief required to reliably portray his
desired characterizations. So in 1907 he published his
infamous essay The Actor and The Uber-Marionette,
where he proposed a technological solution to his
acting problem, and proclaimed that for the artistic
future of the theatre, all live actors should be replaced
by autonomous puppets (Craig, 1907).
In his essay, Craig compared acting to other art
forms, and found it came up short. His main complaint
was against the live actor as a performing medium.
When playing in front of an audience, Craig claimed
that actors allowed their personality or mind to get
in the way of their characterization. Through either
nervousness or ego, they would tend to frequently
act out of character, breaking the believability of their
portrayal for the audience. Painters and musicians,
as visionary artists, could abstract and refine their art
forms with complete control. Actors, who often relied
on their own personality to carry a role, in Craig’s
opinion, did not qualify as artists. His ingenious solution
was to remove the actor entirely from playing in front
of a live audience. He proposed, for the good of the
theatre, that actors had to be banned from the stage
and replaced with an autonomous puppet he called the
Uber-Marionette. Craig already used techniques from
masked theatre and puppetry to insert a performing
object between the actor and audience, which was
known to create a distancing effect for the performer.
The Uber-Marionette concept was an extension of
these techniques intended to entirely remove the
actor in form and personality, leaving only a refined
version of their gesture as an embodied performative
representation.
Craig’s argument may be sound, but his purposely
provocative delivery didn’t receive a positive response
from the theatre community, especially from actors. So
there is some theater, to champion the inclusion of live
performers in the field of computational media today.
Clearly ahead of his time, and highly perfomative
in writing The Mask (Taxidou, 1998), he was often
misunderstood by his contemporaries who either took
his words at face value, or assumed he was writing in
metaphors.The argument can be made that Craig was
actually proposing a vision of the ideal actor intended
for a future performance medium not yet invented. He
said as much in his Uber-Marionette essay when he
wrote, “If you can find in Nature a new material, one
which has never yet been used by man to give form
to his thoughts, then you can say that you are on the
high road towards creating a new art. For you have
found that by which you can create it. It only remains

for you to begin. The Theatre, as I see it, has yet to find
that material.” (Craig, 1907). Though technologically
impossible in his lifetime, Craig never gave up trying
to realize his concept, nor did he ever admit that it
was impossible to build. Though highly criticized by
his contemporaries, he showed an unshakeable belief
that it would be invented someday by discovering a
new control mechanism, “What the wires of the UberMarionette shall be, what shall guide him, who can
say?” (Craig, 1963).
Although Craig’s banishment of the actor has
inadvertently been realized in computational media,
the author contends that his vision of the perfect
actor as an Uber-Marionette can also be realized
by modeling the behavior of embodied agents on
the gesture of live professional performers. If the
essence of good acting is semiotic gestural technique,
or a vector of poses and movements that convey
a symbolic attitude of the intended persona, then
the ideal acting medium is one that can iteratively
refine a trained performer’s gesture to a singular
clear purpose in real-time for a live audience. Craig’s
imagined “wires” are procedural character algorithms
trained on motion capture data, and his desired
new “material” for Theatre is the virtual stage of
games and interactive drama. The author’s MFA thesis
and accompanying Avatar Theatre performances
were intended to translate Craig’s vision to a New
Media context, and to informally assess contemporary
audience reaction to seeing a live performer interacting
with a 3D character in a shared performance space
(See Figure 1; Maraffi, 2010).

Figure 1

Audience feedback suggested that, in the context of
a live dramatic performance, believable interaction
and expressive appeal can possibly solve Computer
Science problems for embodied agents, such as
passing a gestural Turing Test and offsetting the
Uncanny Valley Effect. For instance, there were
335

Digital Humanities 2011

performances when audience members believed that a
remote performer was controlling the Avatar character,
as well as a positive general audience response to
comedic interaction that countered any strangeness
from seeing the avatar mimicking the performer’s
natural movement.

3. From Avatar Theatre to Performatology:
Getting the Performer In the Game
So how does the above MFA research apply to
games and interactive drama? It is the proof-ofconcept for developing a Performatology approach to
designing embodied performative agents at UCSC’s
Computational Cinematics Studio. Using this approach
the author has designed a novel performer modeling
agent architecture, IMPRSONA, which uses machine
learning and motion capture to build a performer
profile from a knowledge base of procedural gesture
prototypes (see Figure 2; Maraffi, 2011).

agent believability problems may be discovered in
simulating the performer’s gestural quality. Embodied
agents in games have the potential to become
interactive New Media icons if we can represent

embodied agent architecture is intended as a
performative component in a broader Nara-PerformaLudic system design (see Figure 3), and is the first step
in a formal Performatology study of real and simulated
embodied performers interacting together in a shared
performance space. Our goal is to get the professional
performer in the game, and get the actor back on the
stage of interactive drama.

We are mapping a performative ontology from
Performance Theory (Barba, 2005; Schechner, 2002;

as a performance artist and technical animator, to
simulate the apprentice training process used by
professional performers when learning and practicing
their craft through mimicry and improvisation. The
author’s hypothesis is that the performer’s technique,
developed over many years of disciplined training,
results in a semiotic quality of gesture that is integral to
portraying believable, expressive, and appealing fictive
characters.
Puppetry and animation over the last century have
shown that abstracting principles from live performers
can simulate the illusion of life in moving images
(Thomas, 1981), as seen in Disney’s Mickey, Henson’s
Kermit, and many other iconic characters, creating
personas that persist in linear time-based media.
These icons indicate that the key to solving embodied

What does it mean to support scholarship in the
21st century? For the digital humanist, scholarly
needs range from providing long-term online access
to digitized collections to developing reusable tools to
discern historical patterns among large data corpuses.
The so-called “age of evidentiary abundance”1 yielded
by linked data and other technological advancements
presents further interpretative challenges: materials
aggregated across collections need to merge content
and context in a seamless research environment.
Supporting all of these endeavors over the long
term requires an efficient underlying structure to
manage evolving technologies, scholarship needs,
and research requirements. This infrastructure must
ensure longevity and usability by attending to curation
and preservation components. Building sustainable
research environments for the long term should be
seen as a core requirement of scholarly infrastructure
in the digital age.
In response to the Digital Humanities 2011
theme of “Big Tent Digital Humanities”, this
poster will demonstrate policy-based approaches
to building sustainable infrastructures for digital
research environments. Drawing on our work from
key funded projects in the United States and
Europe, including Sustaining Heritage Access through
Multivalent ArchiviNg (SHAMAN), DCAPE, and Policy338

Driven Repository Interoperability (PoDRI), we will
showcase how policy- based frameworks can be
applied to both small-scale institutional collections
and to larger, federated multi-repository research
environments. Our work provides a model for how
policy- driven curation and preservation policies can be
used to effectively manage digital humanities data.

A Visual Interface for Exploring
Language Use in Slave
Narratives
Muralidharan, Aditi

aditi@cs.berkeley.edu
Department of Computer Science UC Berkeley

1. Abstract
The increasing prevalence of digitized source material
in the humanities has led to uncertainty about how this
suddenly available information will change scholars'
research methods. What balance will scholars strike
between in-depth examination of a few sources, and a
more "distant reading" (Moretti 2005) of a large number
of them? Our focus is specifically on text collections:
comparing texts, and identifying and tracing patterns
of language use. These tasks are not widely supported
by any current software, but if humanities researchers
want to use digitized text collections on a larger scale,
they will need to do exactly such things.

2. System Description: Computation
The goal of the computation is to extract grammatical
structure from text. We use established techniques
in computational linguistics that allow fast and
reliable extraction of phrase boundaries, inter-word
relationship categories (e.g. subject, verb, object,
modifier etc.) and parts of speech. For example,
the sentence, "Marsupial mammals have pouches."
contains the meaningful unit "marsupial mammals" that
functions as a noun and is therefore a noun-phrase.
It further contains the word "marsupial" which is an
adjective modifier of the word "mammals", which is a
noun. The process is completely general, and can be
applied to any TEI-encoded text collection.

3. System Description: Interface
Based on the features that our literary scholar
collaborators found useful, our current interface
supports three tasks: searching for grammatical or
word-based patterns in text (Figures 1 and 2),
visualizing their distribution in the entire collection
(Figure 3), annotating sections of text with tags and
notes (Figure 4).

We restrict ourselves to a particular collection: the
North American antebellum slave narratives, written by
fugitive slaves in the decades before the Civil War with
the support of abolitionist sponsors. Scholars agree
about the slave narrative's most basic conventions
but it is likely that these narratives, with their extreme
repetitiveness, may also manifest other regular
features that have yet to be detected by scholars. This
project aims to assist literary scholars in uncovering
these patterns with computational techniques.
In collaboration with English scholars, we have built
WordSeer ( http://bebop.berkeley.edu/wordseer), a
system that can compare two or more narratives'
grammatical features, and analyze the distribution of
textual patterns throughout an entire collection. Our
goal is for English scholars to be able to use our system
to gather accurate information about language use
patterns in a way that is intuitive, and natural to them.
We will present the system currently under
development, and share the lessons we have learned
while building a text exploration interface for use in the
humanities.
Figure 1: Easily expressing the query, "How was God described?"

339

Digital Humanities 2011

The search results are augmented with the simple but
powerful visualization of relative frequencies shown
in Figure 2: all the words that God is "described as"
arranged from most to least frequent. The presence of
the adjectives "great, true, just" immediately evokes a
picture of the relationship - one very different from the
picture more negative adjectives might paint. While this
is no substitute for careful literary analysis, it can be
a quick way to judge the extent to which an entity or
event is represented a certain way in a collection, and
so help formulate new hypotheses.
While investigating stylistic similarities between
documents in a collection, it is useful to be able to
investigate occurrences of patterns of interest and
compare their distributions across documents. We
use a visualization called heat maps, which uses the
visual metaphor of text as a brick wall, with each
brick, a section of text, and each column of bricks a
document. Typing in a phrase shows its distribution
throughout the entire collection, and patterns, such
as the overwhelming occurrence (Olney 1984) of the
exact phrase "I was born" at the very beginnings of
narratives ( Figure 3) are easily apparent.

Figure 2: A list of search results
augmented with a frequency visualization.

Figure 3: The distribution of the exact
phrase "I was born" through the collection.

The power of extracting grammatical information is that
a list search results is no longer an opaque list: trends
and comparative frequencies can be extracted and
displayed, giving an instant high-level picture: a guide
to further exploration. For example, if a researcher
were interested in the relationship between slaves and
God, he or she might be interested in how God was
described in the collection. Grammatical search makes
this query easy to express: just type in "God" and
choose the "described as" relationship, as shown in
Figure 1

340

The third research behavior we support is that of
organizing sections of text into sets that illustrate
a point. With our reading and annotation interface
( Figure 4), researchers can highlight sections of text,
and add tags and detailed notes.

Figure 4: Reading and annotating documents with tags and notes.

Adding a tag to a highlighted section of text is like
adding it to a set. Researchers can use the sets
they make in other parts of the application: searching
within a set, or restricting the heat map visualization to
documents in a set.

4. Related Work
In the digital humanities, the closest work to our project
comes from two well- known text analytics efforts.
The first is the MONK project (MONK) incorporating
the SEASR analysis toolkit. These projects offers

Digital Humanities 2011

two computational linguistics tools in addition to word
distribution and frequency statistics: tagging words
with their parts of speech and extracting named
entities. Users can visualize occurrence patterns
of word sequences within a chosen text, and
plot networks of how often named entities occur
near each other. This research led to visual textmining analyses of Emily Dickinson's correspondence
(Catherine Plaisant et al. 2006), and of Gertrude
Stein's "The Making of Americans" (Don et al. 2007)
and an interface for exploring the parts of speech used
near query words of interest (Vuillemot et al. 2009).
The second is Voyeur (Voyeur), which operates
entirely at the word level. It allows users to plot word
frequencies, see concordances (contexts in which
words occur) and create tag clouds.
Other digital humanities projects have used more
advanced language processing, but have not
developed them into user interfaces or combined them
with visualizations. Topic modeling is being applied
to 19th Century British and American novels (Jockers
2010). These novels were also the subjects of cuttingedge computational linguistics research that showed
how to automatically extract social networks from free
text (Elson et al. 2010). Topic modeling is also being
applied to the compendium of Danish, Norwegian, and
Swedish folklore collected by Evald Tang Kristensen.
In the field of visualization, applications to text in the
humanities have been limited to word clouds, and
node-and-link diagrams of named entities, and cooccurrences.
Outside the realm of text, but in the domain of
comparative exploration, LISA, a comparison search
interface for cultural heritage artifacts was created by
(Amin et al. 2010).
The digital humanities work described above comes
from the application of ideas from human-computer
interaction and natural language processing. We are
informed by general principles of search user interface
design described by Hearst (Hearst 2009), and of
visual exploration of large data-sets described by
Shneiderman (Shneiderman 1996).

In recent times, digital resources have taken on
steadily greater importance in the field of Buddhist
studies, with increasing numbers of digitized versions
of Buddhist canonical texts, representation of material
culture, and other objects of research becoming
available on Web. However, despite the basic
availability of such resources, most of them are not
set up in an optimal way for usage by researchers;
nor are they for the most part integrated with each
other. For example, there does not yet exist a system
that can operate with equal efficacy with philological
data related to Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan language
materials. Therefore, a comprehensive and concrete
framework is needed. Although a method of text
description is fairly well established in the form of
TEI P5, neither the interfaces, nor the methods of
presentation of results for digitized works are as yet
satisfactory for the scholars of Buddhism. In this paper,
we will present our approach to the establishment of
requirements for various kinds of materials used in
Buddhist studies and make some suggestions for the
implementation of more functional interfaces as a Web
research environment for such scholars.
At first, it must be noted that it is very difficult to
define adequate requirements for the full range of the
scholars of Buddhism, who come from a broad array
of language training and methodological approaches.
Thus, this paper will focus primarily on the fulfillment
of the requirements for the scholars who are dealing
with authentic scholarly digitized texts. In the field of
Buddhist studies, where texts have been translated
across a number of languages in different regions
at various points in history, we have no recourse
but to deal with several versions of a text, including
transmitted, diffused, and translated variations at the
same time (Fig.1).
342

(Fig. 1. An Example: “ मूलमध्यमककारिका
(Madhyamakakārikā)" and some of the related texts)

As discussed by Steinkellner (1988), it is often difficult
to "recover" the original form of any given text, as they
have been changed variously in their long tradition.
In many cases, all that has come down to us is a
translation that was preserved in the Chinese tradition
since the 2nd century or in the Tibetan tradition since
the 8th century. It is quite often the case that various
witnesses are extant in both traditions. In such cases,
various diplomatic texts in various languages must
be compared in various units such as at the level
of text, chapter, fascicle, sentence, word, syllable, or
even character. Therefore, it is necessary for textual
scholars to prepare an environment that delivers
integrated views of a given text views. On the other
hand, it is important to understand the background
thought and beliefs reflected in each stage of the
textual development—not only in Sanskrit and Pāli
which are the closest to the original form—but also
in Tibetan, Chinese. In this case, each annotation
must be recorded in the context of its diffusion
into other texts. In addition, modern translations of
each text should be pointed to from such texts.
Therefore, it is crucial for Buddhist textual studies to
provide such information within a system of intertextual
relationships. (See Fig. 1)
In order to realize such relationship in digitized
resources, it is necessary to provide the data
in a punctuation-neutral manner. This is because
separation of words or sentences is not always
obvious; punctuating text itself amounts to an
independent and original scholarly contribution,
especially in the cases of Sanskrit and classical
Chinese manuscripts. Therefore, the basic concepts
are:
1. being based on a unit that is not restricted to the
legacy media.

Digital Humanities 2011

2. inheritance of the legacy studies on the paper media.
3. DB providers prepare the space for the sharing of
data units.
4. the users act as recipients of the units and some of
them act as distributors of the units.
5. DB providers develop and distribute their own Web
API so that users can make arbitrary links to access
each others' data.
6. The above are realized as a collaborative research
environment on the Web.
In addition, in order to preserve compatibility with past
research results, all units should be identifiable in
legacy media through traditional referencing methods
such as T0001,01,0001a01 which means Taishō
Daizōkyō, vol.1, page 1, register a (among a, b, and
c), line 1. Then, they should be located by URI by
implementation of Web API so that the other persons
or applications can freely refer to arbitrary units through
Web.
In order to realize such concepts, a collaborative
editing system needs to be developed. Initially, users
should be registered according to their own roles such
as visitor, editor, or administrative editor. The role of
the editor is that of inputting and checking of the data;
the role of administrative editor is checking of the data
and the determination of the distribution of the data.
Both editor and administrative editor should be able to
efficiently select arbitrary units with an easy method
such as mouse click or drag on the text body without
any restriction posed by the textual structure. Then
they can append any necessary information to the units
and link selected units to other ones (Fig. 2).

In the final step, the administrative editor should check
and determine whether each unit is ready for release.
The role of visitor is only to browse the workspace
to observe the progress of the work. On the other
hand, anonymous users can browse only released
data. They can efficiently view various information with
various methods such as mouse click or drag on the
text body and select (or ignore) any data on the basis of
various properties such as their sources, contributors,
and so on. In order to realize such a function on Web,
AJAX will be fully utilized.
Finally, we will explain the Web Database function.
The Web Database stores only relational data that
includes one or two locations in the original materials,
its annotation or relationship information, contributor's
name, data composition and other related information.
The writing rule of the location allows the user to use
the information even without digitized textual material.
However, if the material is originally in digitized form,
the data must refer to a logical location such as the
URI. Users don't need to be aware of separation
between the database and the materials presented to
them because to the viewer of the materials, they seem
to be seamlessly integrated with the database. By this
kind of method, it will be easier to integrate the other
materials which are released on other Web sites into
the environment. The database can provide arbitrary
data according to the user's preference through Web
API, as well as retrieve and show the data provided by
other DBs. From here, the data can be published under
various formats such as RDF. However, in principle,
this kind of system would not be able to avoid the
problem of overlap if there is an intent to publish its data
fully including the original materials. So we are trying
to do so according to TEI P5 by using a kind of standoff markup.

(Fig. 2. The procedures of inputting
relationship data on an environment)
(Fig. 3. The procedures of browsing
the relational data on an environment)

Digital Humanities 2011

Although we have just begun to develop this approach,
it has already been tested by some scholars and
we have seen positive results. Actually, these early
testers say that it is very useful for them because
their accessibility and permissions are limited and
explicitly shown. However, some enhancements have
been suggested, which mainly concern the function of
browsing. We will work on this until the time of DH2011,
when we will able to present a much more matured
system.

ArchiTrace: An Urban Social
History and Mapping Platform
Nieves, Angel David

anieves@hamilton.edu
Hamilton College, United States of America

ArchiTrace is a dynamic, web-based markup tool that
will allow researchers and content authors to work
together in a collaborative co-authoring environment
as they build and share architectural drawings, maps,
and spatial representations of African urban spaces
across a historical timeline. By focusing on the spatial
dimensions of the built environment, historical and
present-day cityscapes become both the backdrop
and interface to a rich archive of cultural heritage
assets gathered over the course of their historical
development. ArchiTrace will combine a broad range
of artifacts such as historical texts and photographs,
maps and aerial photographs, providing both cultural
and historical context to the depicted regions. Finally,
by allowing an audience to watch the transformation of
both the spaces and their cultural artifacts evolve over
expansive timelines, researchers will be able to follow
the historical tracks of the evolution of the regions
themselves.
In the example of Soweto, the model housing schemes
of the 1950s through the 1980s provided by the state
government and its architects were essentially an
attempt at social control, but through the inspection
of aerial photography and the differences in what was
proposed, built, and modified by residents reveals a
certain amount of resistance to the ordered panopticon
of township housing schemes.
Through the aerial photography captured over a
50-year period, the changes in the city’s physical
landscape suggest a form of spatial resistance to
the imposed uniformity of the built environment under
apartheid. By facilitating architectural and spatial
comparisons of this kind through a suite of interactive
mapping and comparative tools, ArchiTrace will allow
historically embedded social histories to become
emergent features of the overall presentation. Where
projects like HyperCities focus on the development of
the urban form, ArchiTrace facilitates the curation of
a biographical narrative in a city’s social history as
a way to characterize the development of a region
and its people.1 HyperCities provides a blank canvas
for understanding urban form, while ArchiTrace will
provide a spatial subtext to urban place making.

Digital Humanities 2011

ArchiTrace’s granular data structure will allow users to
inspect fine detail in a city environment at any level
of scope, whether tracking the development of entire
neighborhoods over decades, or the changes of an
individual building’s architecture over the course of
mere years. ArchiTrace will offer content authors tools
for the creation of data units at several different scopes.
Content authors can “curate” the granular layering of
spatial information from the level of individual home,
block, town or city, to more generalized regional
levels. ArchiTrace’s uniquely granular data structure is
inspired by architectural “Building lives:” mapping the
life cycle of an urban form across a variety of scales
and time periods.
ArchiTrace will feature prominent social networking
and collaborating tools, allowing researchers and
content authors the opportunity to build, share, and
co-edit materials within a project collection. This can
range from the simple sharing of files within a project’s
workspace to the realtime shared editing of text,
architectural drawings, and annotations. ArchiTrace
aims to facilitate researchers and participants alike in
the creation of both collections and exhibits, acting
as both an archival and educational platform for
researchers and public audience.
By engaging open source software and standards,
ArchiTrace aims to create an extensible project
platform capable of growing in the many directions
promised by forthcoming web technologies. As
web-based 3D technology becomes more broadly
implemented in future web browsers, we anticipate
being able to integrate the models from which
our images are derived into an interactive and
dynamically-generated 3D environment. Although the
initial depictions of ArchiTrace’s cityscapes will begin
as 2-dimensional representations, we aim to eventually
extend those aerial photographs, maps, and stillimage renderings of the project into 3D models.
A recent series of discoveries, in the South African
National Archives, provides for some new ways
to begin mapping the growth and development of
townships over the forty-six year apartheid era. Over
the past four months I have come across a cache
of maps, architectural plans, aerial photographs and
other source documents related to the design and
planning of townships across the city of Johannesburg.
These drawings and plans suggest, as many historians
have previously stated, “the apartheid state remained
steadfastly committed to terror” through the design
and “layout of the location [townships which] were
planned with explicit, detailed attention to the
disciplinary potentials of space.”2 As some have

argued, “The tyranny of the planners’ blueprints yielded
a degree of spatial compartmentalization whose sheer
banality had profound implications for every aspect
of urban life.”3 As noted, “when planners reshape
the built environment, individuals are compelled
to adjust accordingly, reinforcing to some extent
the spatial parameters of their oppression.”4 I am
however suggesting that individuals and communities
impart changing meanings to spatial structures over
time. Space not only becomes implicated in the
transformation of self-perceptions and the capacities
of social groups – space both restrains and enables
in some deeply profound ways. Township residents
“were neither simple victims of the state nor pure
protagonists of resistance” – they negotiated their
daily lives through their engagements with racialized
space-making. Resistance, among those incarcerated/
detained/imprisoned in “planned communities” like
Japanese Americans in internment camps, or victims
of the Holocaust through concentration camps, is as
much about the forging of bonds within space as
it is about propelling struggles from one “stage” (or
township), to another. How then might we document
the “spatial underpinnings of apartheid [era] projects”?
After the Soweto Uprising of 1976, the spatial
compression, brought on by township planning and
design, enabled for the mass proliferation of dense
political networks within and between Black residential
areas across Johannesburg. How might we then use
spatial tools to document the history of resistance,
while also telling the story of the ways in which
residents converted the bureaucratic and spatial
impediments to political mobilization into weapons
of struggle? These and other questions – that have
yet to be formulated – are the basis for developing
ArchiTrace.

An Analysis of Recurrences
in Harold Pinter’s Plays Using
CATMA Concordancing Software
Onic, Tomaz

tomaz.onic@uni-mb.si
Department of English and American Studies,
University of Maribor, Slovenia

Recurrence is a crucial feature contributing to a
recognizable style of dramatic characters in the plays
by contemporary British playwright Harold Pinter.
His characters sometimes repeat whole phrases or
sentences, sometimes with slight changes, which
almost always indicate a change in the speaker’s
intention. The repeated passage either follows its first
appearance closely, or can be delayed for a few lines
– or sometimes pages. In general, the most noticeable
recurrences for the audience are those consisting
of multiple repetitions, containing unusual words or
phrases attracting our attention, or consisting of closely
repeated passages.
Beaugrande and Dressler (1988, 54) define recurrence
as a direct repetition of a textual element which
has appeared earlier in the text. They do not call it
repetition because, according to Beaugrande (1991,
18), only seldom is the repetition of part of text a
real repetition. Such absolute recurrence, as he calls
it, would have to carry exactly the same meaning
potential of the repeated phrase as did its first
appearance. In most cases, that does not happen,
as it is usually the very intention of the speaker that
causes the recurrence: “Saying the same thing over
again normally carries a context-sensitive message,
such as approval, insistence, anxiety, doubt, surprise,
or irony. /…/ thus, recurrence is typically an instance of
‘incremental recursion’, where the repeated event adds
to the value of the original” (Beaugrande 1991,18).
A less strict variation of recurrence is partial
recurrence, defined by Beaugrande and Dressler
(1988, 54-55) as the re-appearance of a certain word
in the form of a different part of speech. As such,
it is similar to polyptoton, a figure of speech that is
often defined as repetition of the same word in various
inflected forms. In a later article, Beaugrande (1991)
defines it as the repetition of a word cluster that does
not repeat as a whole; not even all the elements need
to repeat. It suffices that some elements of the original

346

sentence repeat in the same or a sufficiently similar
form.
Some partial recurrences (which can also originate in
language system functions) are random; others appear
as a result of the writer’s or speaker’s intention. Pinter’s
characters can be classified into a combined category,
since their speech – together with recurrences – is
carefully designed in order to sound random.
The role of recurrence in Pinter’s dramatic texts
represents an important translation issue. It is vital
that this stylistic feature be preserved in the target
language as faithfully as possible, since it is not only
an important decorative device but represents one
of the key Pinter’s stylistic trademarks. Unfortunately,
however, the existing research results have shown
that this stylistic element is often disregarded in
translation. It often comes second to meaning or other
similar language elements, but usually its loss can be
attributed to the translator’s lack of awareness of the
importance of recurrence.
A substantial potential danger of omitting recurrence
from translation is the fact that this is not a feature that
disturbs the audience with its absence. For this reason,
it may seem a harmless translation shift; however, it
is, in fact, damaging to the audience’s perception of
Pinter’s style, which is skewed owing to the absence
of such an important stylistic element.
Having been involved in Pinter Studies for about ten
years, I have conducted several research activities
concerning recurrence in Pinter’s plays – into originals
as well as translations – manually. Therefore, the
natural next step was to perform selected parts of
this body of analysis again using digital methods and
thus confirm and broaden – possibly also correct – the
existing results.
The first step in the project was to digitize and
mark up the original texts and their Slovene
translations. These texts were then uploaded into
the new CATMA (Computer-Aided Textual Markup
and Analysis) concordancing program. Since CATMA
allows for searching not only by word or phrase, but
also by “grade of similarity”, it is expected that this
will be useful in attempting to identify those phrases
which are not exact repetitions, but which are similar
enough to be construed as a type of repetition in
the reader’s mind. This will also lend more weight to
any confirmation of the existing idea that recurrences
often are not preserved in translation. Figure 1 shows
how CATMA allows searching with “grade of similarity”
for phrases close to “like a”; when the results are
shown on the screen, you can then select an item

Digital Humanities 2011

or not depending on whether it is similar enough to
possible be what you are looking for. In this case
you would definitely not select the first two examples,
ie detail and Special. Since the similarity percentage
requested here is only 60%, it is understandable that
such items will be deemed as similar; should you raise
the measure to 80%, they, and other items like them,
will not be included in the results.

1. Introduction

Fig. 1 Screen shot of the similarity function in CATMA

Hopefully, the results obtained through this research
will strengthen the awareness of how important it is
to consider this element in translation, and potentially
contribute to a higher quality of the translation theory
and practice in the Slovene cultural space of translated
foreign language literature.
I feel that participating at the DH2011 would offer a
good opportunity to discuss this undertaking and its
practical implementation with other participants who
have experience with similar projects, particularly in the
field of drama which has its own specifics.

In contrast with the large amounts of potential
interesting research material in digital multimedia
repositories, the opportunities to unveil the gems
therein are still very limited. The Oral History project
‘Verteld Verleden’ (Dutch literal translation of Oral
History) that is currently running in The Netherlands,
focuses on improving access to spoken testimonies in
collections, spread over many Dutch cultural heritage
institutions, by deploying modern technology both
concerning infrastructure and access. Key objective
in the project is mapping the various specific
requirements of collection owners and researchers
regarding both publishing and access by means
of current state-of-the-art technology. In order to
demonstrate the potential, Verteld Verleden develops
an Oral History portal that provides access to
distributed collections. At the same time, practical stepby-step plans are provided to get to work with modern
access technologies. In this way, a solid starting point
for sustained access to Oral History collections can be
established.

2. Technology and Daily Practice
The Verteld Verleden project builds upon years of
academic research on access technology for spoken
word archives 1 deploying among others automatic
speech recognition, text-to-speech synchronization
and fragment-level search. This research resulted
in a number of demonstration applications in close
cooperation with cultural heritage institutes 2. Although
these demonstrations have been very well received
both by the public and involved institutes, it was
observed that there is still a gap between academic,
‘technology-driven’ pilots and the daily practice of
347

Digital Humanities 2011

Dutch cultural heritage institutions and researchers.
One important observation was that Oral History
collections are managed in many different ways:
from very adequate to not at all. There are a
few ‘forerunners’ that do already make use of
various professional infrastructures and technologies
for disclosure and access but the larger part of
the collection owners, in spite of acknowledging the
virtues of modern access technologies, often do not
have the knowledge or means to really start using
these. In practice, access to Oral History collections
in general is very limited and publically accessible
overviews on available collections are missing. On
the other hand, we see that collection owners and
researchers have very specific requirements with
regard to management, disclosure and access, and
have very detailed knowledge of their collections and
their contexts.

3. Knowledge Transfer
In order to be able to catch up with the advantages
of the digital networked society, cultural heritage
institutes need practical handles that are specifically
geared towards their specific use cases. The Verteld
Verleden project follows this practical approach by
mapping the available solutions and best practices
in The Netherlands on a diversity of relevant
topics ranging from digitization of audio-visual data,
format conversion, online access to collections, and
(semi)automatic metadata generation, and linking
collections to other information sources, to dealing
with privacy/copyright issues. On an academic level,
special attention is addressed towards transfer of
knowledge and awareness on methodology and theory
of Oral History research, and the design of Oral History
research in combination with modern technology.

4. Showcase
To showcase how these best-practices and solutions
could work out in practice the project builds an
embeddable Oral History portal that enables access
to distributed oral history collections. The general
approach is that collections owners are urged
to comply with interoperability standards on the
dissemination of metadata and content. By adopting
these standards, content owners allow aggregators
to channel content into local portals (e.g., Verteld
Verleden) or even international portals such as the
Europeana portal 3. The Verteld Verleden portal serves
here as a so called thematic portal.
Verteld Verleden promotes OAI-PMH, the Protocol for
Metadata Harvesting and stimulates content owners
348

to have their content available using a streaming
media protocol to enable play-out of search results.
The Verteld Verleden portal harvests metadata from
associated institutes and provides centralized search
for searching and browsing the collections that are
linked up. As the portal’s user interface can also be
embedded in the local websites, content owners can
be provided with search functionality for their own
content.

5. State-of-the-art
The portal is equipped with state-of-the-art search
technology and a flexible user interface that allows
the project to adapt it easily to the requirements of
researchers and content owners that are expected
to advance during the project as a result of
discussions at workshops and local expert sessions.
An important requirement of researchers is evidently
to have sophisticated means to access and analyse
available Oral History collections. To a large extent
however, access to collections is rather limited due
to the lack of appropriate fragment-level semantic
descriptions. Metadata is often only sparsely available,
forcing scholars to play an A/V item in full in
order to decide if, and if so, which parts of the
material are of interest for their research. Moreover,
exploring possible correlations and connections both
within and across large data collections requires
an additional layer on top of the metadata for
the interlinking of multimedia content sources and/
or collection fragments. Ultimately, also dedicated
technology for browsing, accessing, analysing and
comparing sources effectively during the various
phases of research (exploration, analysis, publication,
verification) are a prerequisite for the innovation
of the methodological framework of humanities
researchers and for the formulation of new questions
and the renewal of research agendas. In order to
successfully exploit these technologies for the purpose
of humanities research, their development must
strongly be steered by the demands and requisites of
the researchers and their research paradigms.

6. Speech Recognition
A special role in the project is assigned to the use
of speech recognition technology. Speech recognition
can play an important role in the process of making
Oral History content better accessible, either directly
via the conversion of speech to text or indirectly
using available textual transcripts and a technology
derived from speech recognition often referred to as
forced-alignment. Verteld Verleden offers associated
content owners the use of a speech recognition service

Digital Humanities 2011

supported by the Dutch CATCHPlus program 4, that
aims to valorise scientific research results to usable
tools and services for the Entire Dutch heritage sector.
Deploying speech recognition brings up an additional
challenge with regard to metadata models and
harvesting standards: it encompasses the need to
incorporate time-labelled into the metadata model.
Approaches are currently investigated in close
collaboration with CLARIN-NL, a project on Common
Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure 5

This poster presents an account of the development
of a collaborative research environment for the
socio-historical linguistic exploration of a unique
seventeenth-century resource of Irish national
importance and international significance. It is also an
account of the process - from inception to application
- of a highly interdisciplinary, unique collaboration
between academia and industry, which is part of an
evolving set of DH projects.
The '1641 Depositions' in Trinity College Dublin
comprise some 8,000 personal statements, in which
mainly Protestant men and women of all classes
told of their experiences following the outbreak of
the 1641 Rebellion in Ireland by the Catholic Irish.
Collected by government-appointed commissioners,
the witness testimony runs to approximately 20,000
pages, and constitutes the chief evidence for the
sharply contested allegation that the rebellion began
with a general massacre of Protestant settlers. As a
result, this material has been central to protracted and
bitter historical dispute.
This body of material, unparalleled elsewhere in
Early Modern Europe, provides a unique source of
information for the causes and events surrounding
the 1641 Rebellion and for the social, economic,
cultural, religious, political and linguistic history of
349

Digital Humanities 2011

seventeenth-century Ireland, England and Scotland.
In addition, the depositions vividly document various
colonial and 'civilizing' processes, including the spread
of Protestantism in one of the remotest regions of
the Stuart kingdoms and the introduction of lowland
agricultural and commercial practices, together with
the native response to these developments.
Following the recent completion of a three year
process of digitizing, transcribing and annotating the
1641 Depositions, the resulting Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI) encoded corpus has become available for digital
enhancement and analysis. The Arts and Humanities
Research Council (AHRC) of the United Kingdom
has funded the next generation of research on this
corpus under the auspices of their ‘Digital Equipment
and Database Enhancement for Impact’ programme.
‘Language and Linguistic Evidence in the 1641
Depositions’ is a multi-disciplinary Digital Humanities
project designed to create an interactive computer
environment in which scholars interested in historical
linguistics, corpus analysis and forensic linguistics /
discourse analysis can work together with historians,
Early Modern prose scholars and other specialists
to interrogate these valuable resources, exploiting
new methods of personalization, visualization and
collaboration.
The 1641 Collaborative Linguistic Research and
Learning Environment (CLRLE) has been developed
using Omeka, an open-source digital archival
collections management system that has become
a popular tool in the Digital Humanities for
archiving, publishing and managing access to primary
source materials such as documents, images,
transcriptions and other multimedia resources (see
http://omeka.org/). Omeka is an ideal tool for exploring
the concept of a collaborative research interface,
since it doubles as a content management system
and offers myriad possibilities for personalization and
collaboration amongst users.
The resulting web-based portal houses fully
searchable records of the 1641 Depositions as ‘Items’
in various ‘Collections’, as is typical in Omeka-powered
applications. Privileged users of the interface can
collaboratively manage the archive and its content,
editing Collections and Item metadata (e.g. deposition
transcriptions, dates and deponent and commissioner
names), annotating and tagging Items and contributing
specialist content to public web pages on the site.
A central part of this project has been
knowledge exchange with IBM’s LanguageWare
Research and Development Team. LanguageWare
(http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/lrw) is IBM’s
350

natural
language
processing
software
and
is
part
of
the
Unstructured
Information
Management Architecture (UIMA) framework (http://
uima.apache.org/). Researchers have addressed the
challenge of applying this software (designed for
contemporary language analysis) to the highly
problematic “dirty data” of the 1641 corpus, with
its propensity to variable spellings, morphologic
instability and syntactic complexity. This has allowed
the identification of important processes of linguistic
change and has enabled linguists to trace the
development of English in this unique Early Modern
corpus. This involved the integration of a suite of
software creating a domain-specific UIMA pipeline
which offered a level of accuracy comparable to
that achieved by manual annotators (Sweetnam and
Fennell, 2010). A crucial element of CLRLE will be
the integration and exploitation of the results of this
analysis.
A particularly valuable feature of the Omeka-powered
CLRLE is the provision of an interactive Exhibit Builder
tool enabling users to create personalized ‘Exhibits’
of their research outcomes. These Exhibits draw
together a highly extensible collection of reusable
research objects, including transcribed depositions
and associated metadata, dynamic visualizations,
the outputs of statistical linguistic analyses and
GIS displays. These Exhibits facilitate a high level
of research cooperation and dissemination, and
also have considerable pedagogical and outreach
applications.
This poster charts the successful completion of a
multi-disciplinary collaboration involving the adaptation
and modification of new and evolving open source
technologies for humanities research, significant
knowledge exchange between industry and academia,
and the interaction of a range of private and public
institutions including the University of Aberdeen,
Trinity College Dublin, Lancaster University, IBM
LanguageWare and the Irish Digital Humanities
Observatory (http://dho.ie/). The outcomes of this
project offer valuable lessons for future undertakings
in the Digital Humanities. CLRLE is an exemplar of
the potential for the impact of modern technology
and new methodologies on our understanding of
historical resources and underlying processes and
their continuing contemporary relevance.

Critical editions can be complex objects to digitise both
in the output/publication process and in the production.
In most cases, for the output, there is the need to
manage facsimiles, a main text (with lots of diacritics,
deletions, suppressions, supplied text), an apparatus
(with a very dense, conventional notation), footnotes
(with cross references and bibliographic references),
and conventional markings for page breaks from
previous editions and/or manuscripts, in the form of
other digitised text or images.
On the production side we have witnesses of the text,
forming the direct tradition, in some cases followed
by re-elaborations, contemporary or later translations,
quotations that form the indirect tradition. This picture
is usually completed by previous critical editions,
commentaries, and a possibly large set of secondary
references from other texts, dictionaries, biographies
and prosopographical data.
The present paper will outline an attempt made at
the Department for Digital Humanities, King’s College
London1 to produce a model for new editions and
translations of all English legal codes, edicts, and
treatises produced up to the time of Magna Carta,
1215.
This particular project, called Early English Laws2,
presents a situation which is even more complex with
respect to what has been outlined above. This is
because of two characteristics typical of legal texts:
1. All the witnesses of a tradition were effective binding
laws in a specific place and time, including the

351

Digital Humanities 2011

mistakes added in the production of the manuscript
copy.
2. Laws were constantly re-elaborated to become
new laws and each of these stages of elaboration
represents a fully effective law.
This means that the legal text is regularly transmitted
in a number of versions, witnesses of both the direct
and the indirect tradition.
As a result, each law can be represented as a universe
of texts and images that relate to each other: this
universe can be exemplified in the figure below, a
diagrammatic representation of the so-called Treaty of
Edward and Guthrum and its relations, one of which
includes an Old English translation which has its own
universe of relations (see figure 1)

generate inconsistencies, which will cause problems
when developing the editorial environment and web
site.
The solution to this problem is identifying each
component of the text/image universe as entities,
their properties and interrelationships can help
to disambiguate concepts through the systematic
analysis of the sample material. Borrowing elements
from the FRBR model is also proving to be very
useful in our attempt to discover and separate off
hidden conceptual layers in our first version of the
data model. The Entity-Relationship representation of
the overall data model and the formal and careful
definition of problematic concepts provides a shared
vocabulary which helps the members of the project
team to communicate with precision about the subject
domain, whether they are from a programming or
indeed from a solely humanistic background (Pierazzo,
2010). Moreover this conceptual data model serves as
a basis for the transformation into a database schema,
which will support the entire set of resources.
Given the variety of content involved in this project, this
transformation into a database will be challenging as
well. Indeed, the information captured by this project
can be divided in two categories depending the format
of its representation (see figure 2).

Figure 1

The development of the project presents a series of
problems, for which a series of solutions are being
tested and implemented. The Early English Laws
project represents a case study of a more general
issue, namely how to model critical edition from a
conceptual point of view.
The main concern until now has been the need to
create a conceptual model for the editions in order
to identify the best structure to support the variety
of content offered by the project. The difficulty here
lies in trying to apply the philological terminology and
needs to the level of conceptual discrimination required
by the normalisation process involved in the design
of a relational database schema that can be able to
connect related law codes. For instance the term 'text'
is extremely ambiguous as it actually implicitly conveys
different concepts such as a work, an edition, a version,
a transcription or a translation (Carlyle, 2006).
Failing to identify and address this issue would
inevitably lead to a poor organisation of data. This,
in turn, would confuse the editorial work and also
352

Figure 2

1. The entities identified during the modelling process,
their properties and the relationships among those
entities. These are ideally stored in a relational
database. The relational database is also very
advantageous for the storage, editing, indexing and
referencing of authority lists.
2. All the information found in the text of the manuscript
transcriptions or the peripheral textual information
such as the critical apparatus, the introduction text
for the manuscript, the comments. The best format

Digital Humanities 2011

for this type of information is XML with conformance
to the TEI guidelines.
The main challenge here is how can we harmoniously
combine the two very different types of information
within the same database management system,
especially when we consider how deeply interrelated
they are (e.g. an inline reference from one text to
another or to an authority list will consist in inserting a
primary key of relational tuples within an attribute of a
TEI element).

the world will volunteer to edit a list of available laws and input
their work directly into a web-based interface. This should ideally
allow for a minimal amount of reworking by one or two people
volunteering to review submissions.

To solve this, we are intending to exploit the XMLoriented facilities offered by recent relational database
management systems to keep all the information
centralised and linked up despite being hybrid in
nature. Substantial custom development to the editing
framework (possibly Django) is also expected in
order to allow the user interface to acknowledge and
seamlessly integrate the two types of data.

linking between encoded text and image of text, and
image annotation. The software will be complete and
ready for release in June 2011.
TILE was designed to change the way that people
think about digital humanities tools. Many tools created
for humanists are built within the context of a single
project, focusing either on a single set of materials or
on materials from a single time period, and this limits
their ability to be adapted for use by other projects. The
TILE project – not just the software, but the project itself
– was designed to cut across subjects and materials.
Because it is simple, with focused functionality, TILE
will be usable by a wide variety of scholars from
different areas and working with a variety of materials
– illustrations and photographs as well as images of
text. To help ensure this, we brought together several
collaborators from different projects with different
needs to provide advice and testing for our work: The
Swinburne Project and Chymstry of Isaac Newton at
Indiana University-Bloomington, the Homer Multitext
Project at Harvard’s Center for Hellenic Studies, and
the Mapas Project at the University of Oregon. In
addition, we were very fortunate during the life of
the project to have volunteers test the software on
their own materials, or to provide materials for us
for testing. We also received feedback from user
testing performed at the Department of Information
354

Studies, University College London, and the School
of Library and Information Science, Indiana University
Bloomington.
The basic functionality of TILE is to create links
between images and text that relates to that image
– either annotations or transcriptions. We have paid
particular attention to linking between image of text
and transcription of text. These links may be made
manually, but the project also includes an algorithm,
written in JavaScript, for recognizing text within an
image and automatically associating the coordinates
with a Unicode transcription. Additionally, the tool can
import and export transcriptions and links from and to
a variety of metadata formats (TEI, METS, OWL) and
will provide an API for developers to write mappings
for additional formats. Of course, this functionality is
immediately useful to a relatively limited set of editors
of digital materials, but we have made modularity
and extensibility primary goals of the project, and in
our demonstration we hope to be able to show new
recognition algorithms to, for instance, identify printer
watermarks or panels in a graphic novel.
Many members of the TILE development team are
also members of the Open Annotation Collaboration
(OAC), and have therefore attempted to develop
TILE’s annotation features to be OAC compliant. Like
OAC, TILE assumes that the text and the images
to be linked may exist at separate and completely
unconnected servers. When a user starts the TILE tool
for the first time, she is prompted to supply a URI to a
TILE compliant JSON file [pictured in figure A].

FIGURE A: Opening screen of TILE tool

TILE’s JSON is simple and thoroughly documented,
and we provide several translators to map common
existing metadata formats to the format. We have
already created a PHP script that will generate TILE
JSON from a TEI P5 document and are currently
working to do the same for the METS files used in the
Indiana University’s METS navigator tool. We hope to
have other translators to show in our demonstration,
particularly one that will import TEI/XML conformant
with the University of Victoria’s Image Markup Tool.
Additionally, TILE provides a modular exporting tool
that allows users to run the work they’ve done in TILE
through an external translator and then download the

Digital Humanities 2011

result to the client computer. For example, a user may
import a set of images and transcripts from a METS file
at the Library of Congress, use TILE to link images and
text, and then export the result as a TEI file. The TEI
file may then be reimported to TILE at a later data to
further edit or convert the file.
At the poster session at DH2011, we will demonstrate
the final functionality of TILE and to display a poster
and provide handouts that describe the thinking behind
TILE, how it is intended to be used, and details on how
TILE is built and functions.

CLAROS (Classical Art Research Online Services) is
a technology and data collaboration between classical
art and archaeology research projects, museums
and semantic web researchers. Documenting objects
from the museums of the world, CLAROS aims to
engage with the public across the widest possible
spectrum. It builds on the success of the Beazley
Archive which has provided programmes for the public
as well as the scholar and an illustrated linked
dictionary for more than fifteen years. CLAROS (http://
www.clarosnet.org/) is based at the University of
Oxford, with partners in the UK, France, Germany,
Switzerland and Greece. The portfolio includes an
aggregating RDF database, web discovery interfaces
for different types of audience, visual search using
image analysis of shapes and images, semantic
information extraction from digitized text, place and
name gazetteers, and investigation of avatars for
resource discovery. CLAROS aims to be an effective
and powerful partner in the realm of semantic web and
linked data about the past.

1. Data Modelling

3. Visual Search

The CLAROS aggregating data cache pulls
information from its partners, limiting itself to those
interchange components which can be mapped to
the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM)
ontology1, with a few extensions relating to dates
and geolocations. The majority of records so
far use CRM concepts E22_Man-Made_Object,
E53_Place, E52_Time-Span and E21_Person. The
data contributions, using XML RDF as the ingest form,
include the Beazley Archive (pottery and gems)2 and
the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names (onomastic
data)3 at the University of Oxford, the Arachne
Sculpture Archive4, the Lexicon Iconographicum
Mythologiae Classicae in Paris5 and Basel6, and
the German Archaeological Institute7, producing an
RDF triple store of over 20 million assertions. The
federating and subsidiarity principle of CLAROS is that
it acts simply as a resource discovery system, with
search results linking back to the host database for
more information, preserving the IPR and intellectual
integrity of each partner. A SPARQL interface and
RESTful APIs are provided for expert use, but
CLAROS itself provides an exemplar query and
visualisation interface (the Explorer) with an emphasis
on textual search, timeline display and mapping of
results. It is expected that the user will start with
broad search terms, receive back information from
a wide variety of sources, and then gradually refine
and explore the results, perhaps ending in unexpected
places.

A novel aspect of CLAROS is that visual queries can
be used to access and search the archives that are
linked to within CLAROS. Suppose, for example, that
a novice takes a photograph of a Greek vase in a
museum on their iPhone, or finds an image of a Greek
vase on the web, that they would like to know more
about. This image can be use as a visual query to
retrieve that vase from the archive, in much the same
way as the text phrase “Greek vase” can be used as
a query in Google to retrieve web pages which contain
that phrase. The method is illustrated in Figure 1: the
image is uploaded to a web server, and the server
returns the matches in the archive together with metainformation – for instance identifying the type of the
vase, its date, its material, its decorations etc.

2. Metamorphoses
One of the research subprojects of CLAROS
is Metamorphoses, whose aim is to establish a
working co-reference system for name, place and
date information in classical art and archaeology
and ancient history projects at Oxford. This will
provide geo-naming and geo-locating services to both
CLAROS partners in their normal research, and to
the CLAROS Explorer in performing searches. One
output is an aggregating Ancient Place Server with web
services to answer queries about locations of places,
names of places, and types of places within a chosen
area. We work on a social model of places as objects
which come into existence as a result of naming by
one or more groups of people at a particular time. We
expect places to have multiple names, to have different
geographical limits over time, and to have relationships
with other places.

Figure 1: Identifying a vase from a web photo: an image of a
vase is uploaded from a web link (top), and is matched to one
in the Beazley vase collection (middle) in real time (a search
through over 100,000 images). This identifies the type of vase,
its material, date and decorations from the meta-information
(bottom) associated with this data in the Beazley archive.

Figure 2 gives another example, this time for a visual
search of the Arachne classical sculpture archive.

Figure 2: Identifying a sculpture from a web photo: an image
of a sculpture is uploaded from a web link (top), and is
matched to one in the Arachne sculpture collection. In turn,
this provides links to other images of the sculpture in the
collection and also to associated meta-information (bottom).

That this visual search is possible, and indeed can
be carried out with results being returned immediately,
is due to recent methods developed in the computer
vision community on visually searching for objects in
large scale image datasets (see [1] for details).

High level analyses of document images are mainly
based on the output of a page segmentation
process. For example, the extracted text regions
can be the input to an OCR system to retrieve
the ASCII characters printed on the pages. The
spatial relationships between segmented blocks
along with other features can be used in logical
page organization analysis to group the extracted
components appropriately and recover the correct
reading order. Many techniques for page segmentation
have been proposed in the literature but most of
them are based on the assumption that an input
document image consists of a set of rectangular
blocks. Furthermore, the classification step is generally
domain specific and uses static rules to automatically
determine, for each block, the coherent label selected
from a predefined list (title, paragraph, graphic,
table,...). These limitations appear too restrictive with
respect to some noisy and distorted documents and
new approaches need to be developed.
In this context, we present a work achieved in
collaboration with the “Centre d’Etude Superieur de la
Renaissance” of Tours (CESR / http://www.cesr.univtours.fr). The CESR is a training and research centre
which receives students and researchers who wish to
work on various domains of the Renaissance using
a rich library of historical books. The CESR wants
to create a Humanistic Virtual Library; however, until
now, only bitmap versions of several books that have
been scanned or photographed are accessible. The
initial objective of the CESR was to obtain an ASCII
version of the text contained in the pages of these
historical books. The centre first tried to use the
commercial OCR software to index their books but they

358

Digital Humanities 2011

quickly realized that, applied to historical documents,
this procedure would had been vowed to failure. So,
the CESR asked our Pattern Recognition and Image
Analysis research team to help them to define a new
system adapted to their needs. They have appreciated
our efforts as our collaboration will lead to a system
able to bring a better description and indexation of
the content of their books and would also make the
search and the reading of these precious historical
books easier.
The poster will first describe the new hybrid method
we have developed for the extraction of layout
information and of specific elements like graphical
parts or ornaments based on the construction of
two representations of the contents of the images.
A mapping of the shapes and a mapping of
the background are computed. By exploiting this
information, our algorithm produces and sends back
a list of blocks constituting a first segmentation result.
Then, this initial representation of the image is used
during a more sophisticated analysis. Having an aim
of genericity, the architecture of the system that we
carried out authorizes an interactive installation of
scenarios for analysis of the image contents. Scenarios
work on the initial representation provided by the
first step of the segmentation. According to its needs
(localization of the ornamental letters, the notes at
margins, titles,…) and using user-friendly interfaces,
the user (not expert in image processing) builds
scenarios allowing to label, to merge, to remove the
blocks contained in the intermediate representation.
One can thus locates the desired entities without
taking care of the other areas of the image. The
elaborated scenarios can then be stored, modified
and applied to various sets of images during batch
processing. The results obtained with this method
are very interesting; the adjustment of the necessary
parameters is straightfoward and not sensitive to
variations. The originality of our approach lies in the
opportunity which we offer to the users to be able to
build, in an interactive way, scenarios of incremental
analysis. We propose to call this new method “userdriven analysis” in opposition to data-driven or modeldriven methods. The goal is, on the basis of the initial
segmentation, to be able to make the representation
of the images evolve in a progressive way to lead
to the finest possible characterization of its contents
according to the user objectives and to the type of
images to be analyzed. The CESR has processed
several complete books using AGORA prototype and
their own scenarios of block classification. Thus, the
CESR has increased the number of books offered to
the users in its Virtual Library (see http://www.bvh.univtours.fr). Even if the system produced some errors, the

processing and time saved as compared to manual
processing is considerable (for exemple, the manual
indexation of the page layout of an historical book of
300 pages last approximately two days instead of only
two hours when using Agora), this providing to the
specialists of historical books, a useful tool which they
had never imagine (see Figure 1).
Concerning text transcription, the originality of our
work relies upon the analysis and exploitation of
pattern redundancy in documents to allow efficient and
quick transcription of books as well as identification
of typographic materials. This pattern redundancy is
mainly obtained via clustering methods. Like this,
the traditional OCR problem could be reformulated
into a text transcription one. A text, be it ancient
or not, is made up of sequences of symbols. The
scanning process produces pictures where symbols
are represented as thumbnails of patterns (a pattern
could be a single character, a part of a character or a
set of joined characters), which may be more or less
distinct. Without prior knowledge about the meaning
of these symbols, the application of a clustering
approach assigns thumbnails of a similar shape to the
same cluster. As an example, one cluster containing
thumbnails of the lowercase letter “a,” another one the
uppercase letter “A,” yet another one the letter “b” in a
specific font, and so on. Once the clustering is done, a
user could assign a label to each cluster using a other
Graphics User Interface (software called RETRO).
These labels are then automatically assigned to each
pattern, thus achieving the text transcription of the
whole book. In this way, if 90% of patterns are detected
as redundant, only one character in ten will be labeled
by the user in order to transcribe the book. This part
of the work is still in progress and is corresponding
to a Google Digital Award obtained by our team in
December 2010.

Emergent mobile technologies offer museum
professionals new ways of engaging visitors with
their collections. Museums are powerful learning
environments and mobile technology can enable
visitors to experience the narratives in museum objects
and galleries and integrate them with their own
personal reflections and interpretations. UCL’s QRator
project is exploring how handheld mobile devices and
interactive digital labels can create new models for
public engagement, personal meaning making and the
construction of narrative opportunities inside museum
spaces.
The QRator project is located within the emerging
technical and cultural phenomenon known as ‘The
Internet of Things’: the technical and cultural shift
that is anticipated as society moves to a ubiquitous
form of computing in which every device is ‘on’, and
connected in some way to the Internet. The project is
based around technology developed at the Centre for
Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL and is an extension
of the ‘Tales of Things’ project which has developed a
‘method for cataloguing physical objects online which
could make museums and galleries a more interactive
experience’ (Giles, 2010) via means of QR tags.
The project aims to genuinely empower members of
the public within the Grant Museum by allowing them to

360

become the ‘Curators’. The project develops a custom
UCL Museums iPhone, iPad and Android application
which will be available free of charge from the iTunes
store and Android market place.Small printed  QR
codes   for museum objects will be created, linked to
an online database allowing the public to view ‘curated’
information and most notably to send back their own
interpretation and views via their own mobile phone.
Unique in the UCL technology is the ability to ‘write’
back to the QR codes. This allows member of the
pubic to type in their thoughts and interpretation of the
object and click ‘send’.  Similar in nature to sending
a text message, the system will enable the Grant
Museum to become a true forum for academic-public
debate, using low cost, readily available technology,
enabling the public to collaborate and discuss object
interpretation with museum curators and academic
researchers.  Visitors narratives subsequently become
part of the museum objects history and ultimately the
display itself via the interactive label system to allow
the display of comments and information directly next
to the artifacts.
QRator provides the opportunity to move the
discussion of objects from the museum label onto
users’ mobile phones, allowing the creation of a
sustainable, world leading model for two-way public
interaction in museum spaces. UCL's Grant Museum
of Zoology houses one of the country's oldest and
most important natural history collections. The Grant
museum has a strong history as a teaching collection
but also functions as a key gateway for the public to
engage with academic issues in innovative ways.
Museums have undergone a fundamental shift from
being primarily a presenter of objects to being a
site for experiences, which offer visitors opportunities
for individual meaning making and narrative creation.
Many visitors expect or want to engage with a
subject, physically as well as personally (Adams
et al 2004; Falk and Dierking 2000). Visitors see
interactive technology as an important stimulus
for learning and engagement (Falk et al 2002;
Black 2005), empowering users to construct their
own narratives in response to museum exhibits.
Beyond expected content synthesis, these immersive
activities can stimulate learning. Engaged within this
immersive environment, museum objects become
rich sources of innovation and personal growth
(Fisher and Twiss-Garrity 2007). When visitors
experience a museum which actively encourages
individual narrative construction, their activity is
directed not towards the acquisition or receipt of the
information being communicated by the museum, but
rather towards the construction of a very personal

Digital Humanities 2011

interpretation of museum objects and collections. The
unpredictability of multiple narrative forms created
by the use of mobile devices and interactive labels
introduces new considerations to the process by which
museums convey object and collection interpretation
and opens up museums to become a more engaging
experience.

Silverman, L. H. (1995). 'Visitor meaning making in
museums for a new age'. Curator. 38(3): 161-169.

The participation in collaborative narrative creation
centred around museum objects can provoke
creative, independent analysis, promoting a personal
connection with museum exhibition subject matter
that is unparalleled in more traditional and passive
approaches (Silverman 1995; Roberts 1997; HooperGreenhill 2000; Fisher and Twiss-Garrity 2007). This
research aims to stress the necessity in actively
engaging visitors in the creation of their own
interpretations of museum collections. This poster
presents the development of the QRator project so far,
highlights the user centred development activities, its
opportunities, challenges and provides an insight into
how utilising mobile technology can enhance visitor
meaning making and narrative construction.

1. Abstract
URL of the project:http://siedrix.com/work/acms/
This poster presentation will describe a project
currently underway at the Faculty of Filosofía y
Letras, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México
(UNAM). It has been funded by a grant from the
Programa de Apoyo a Proyectos para la Innovación y
Mejoramiento de la Enseñanza (PAPIME), a university
endowment program for innovation in education. It is
a collaborative documentation project of the individual
and collective processes of research and writing
of a group of 25 researchers, working on papers
about the contemporary strategies of appropriation of
the antiquity and aims to use innovative web-based
technology to document different data of the research/
writing process and to create a visualization model to
use the data for educative and didactical purposes.

2. Background, Assumptions and Needs
In May 2010 a group of professors and researchers
teaching at the Facultad de Filosofía y Letras,
UNAM, gathered to start a project following Barbara
362

Cassin’s proposal from the conference Les Stratégies
contemporaines d'appropriation de l'Antiquité. The
objective is to create a seminar and produce
papers on the subject of the contemporary strategies
of appropriation of the antiquity, for a series of
publications to be used as a teaching material in
a variety of courses in Contemporary and Classical
philosophy at the faculty.
The main assumption of the project is that we cannot
have access to the classic antiquity without mediation
or heritage (Gadamer 2005). Reading and studying
Classical philosophy implies the act of taking a position
in a horizon of interpretation from which the object of
research is built, the problems around it are articulated
and the center of attention is decided.
Project’s seminar and papers will discuss those
strategies in contemporary authors from France and
Germany, who study the antiquity and point out the
horizon of interpretation from which they approach the
ancient texts. The findings will be used to teach the
conceptions of contemporary authors and their ideas
of Classical philosophy, as an example of Nietzsche’s
thesis that there are not facts but interpretations
(1998), and to explain technically to students the
process that produces an interpretation.
The idea to use a web-based technology for a
collaborative documentation project came afterwards,
once all these ideas about the project were settled.
A paradox emerged from the project approach: in
order to describe those horizons of interpretation
of all the researchers, both as individuals and as
a group, needed to create their own horizon of
interpretation. Can we document that process? With
that documentation, can we answer the question “from
which horizon are they writing?” And can we use the
documentation for teaching?
As opposed to traditional research in philosophy,
which analyzes finished works to set the horizon of
interpretation; we want to produce a record of an
ongoing work to show how the horizon is created and
how it changes with the influence of new readings
or the interaction with other researchers. These goals
lead us to two main problems:
1. What kind of data do we need to collect to have an
idea of the horizon of interpretation?
2. How to collect data in an open and dynamic way that
allows us to follow the process of research and its
changes during a period of time?
We focus on the two main activities in academic
literacy: reading and writing. The kinds of data we want

Digital Humanities 2011

to obtain are the reading annotations as an evidence
of reading and the variants of the progressive writing1.
Also, it will be relevant for us to keep a record of the
methodology adopted by the individual researchers as
a single data or as a succession of variants.
All these data must be obtained while researchers are
working on the project and until they finish their papers.
It is vital to have not only a record of individual activity
but also of the collective work of the professors.

3. Blogging, Annotating, Writing
Our project is an application of collaborative
"crowdsourcing" (Albors 2008), following previous
experiences in Digital Humanities. For instance, we
have in mind the success of “A Day in the Life of Digital
Humanities”, using blogging and wiki for collaborative
documentation of daily activities of digital humanists2.
It consists of each one of our 25 researchers writing
their own blog in which they document their daily
research activities, as well as commentating on
other blog entries during a year. This mechanism
will allow us to have the seminar virtually and to
trace collective work around independent participation.
However, additionally we need to collect annotations
and methodological assumptions. In order to do so we
have already developed a web application for these
specifics needs:

3.1. Capturing and Highlighting Quotes:
With our web application researchers can upload
book passages and highlight some paragraphs in it,
to document and share its readings. Every passage
will be able to be marked by different researchers
and the web application allows comparisons between
these marks. Highlighting different parts of a same text
shows individual decision and collective assumptions.
During the process of the project, all the mark up will
be made as a reference to a place on the passage and
they will be part of a rendering system in Javascript.
This makes the marks live outside the text. Once
the project is finished, the marks will be exported to
TEI to preserve the documents and marks that will
be part of the text. Nevertheless, during this process
each contributor can mark Dates, Names, Terms and
Quotes as done with TEI Lite in order to also produce
a strong markup of the text to use it didactically
for students, for example, by linking those marks to
complementary information about the persons named,
the terms used, etc. Passages entries and highlights
can be commented by other participants and can be
linked to blog entries.

3.2. Explain and Update Methodology
Researchers can explain their methodology and are
able to update their methodological assumptions
anytime they decide to change the study methodology
or the study subject in our web application, simply by
filling the methodology box in their profile. At the end
of the project we will be able to compare the evolution
of the research in a timeline, mixed with their blog post
and annotation, having an insightful way to analyze the
initial work and their finished paper.

4. Individual and Collective
Highlighting quotations and comments on blog and
quotation entries are ways to have evidence of
individual decisions and collective assumptions. We
extend this view to the creation of metadata. As it
is used in many commercial and academic projects,
researchers can create metadata or use those that
had been created by others, for sources excerpts and
blogs. Metadata are central to finding links between
autonomous and collective work. The final ontology
can help us to understand how strong the collective or
the individual view has been. We are still working on
the metadata creation rules.

5. The Didactic Aim
As an educational project, the last objective is to use
the documentation to help students to understand how
we study the classical antiquity from a horizon of
interpretation. As a tool for education, it allows students
to:
1. Follow individual researcher’s work in real time
during the activity of the project.
2. Compare quotes and highlights being used by
different researchers.
3. Follow the entries (blogging, passages, highlighting,
methodology) on a modern or classical author.
4. Have extra information about modern or classical
authors (reference, biography, bibliography)

near the closest item. We encode a time interval
residing in an item boundary into a color-shaded line
segment. Color shade is used as an indicator of the
proximity to the nearest item. The length of a segment
is in proportion to the total time spent in the layout. The
time segment is placed in the row corresponding to its
item boundary. A path of visited items is illustrated by
connecting the time segments with vertical lines.
With the proposed visualization, we can easily find
the trend of visitor circulation which strictly follows
the pathway designed by a curator. The trend is
represented by the white line, called “Forward”,
running from the most left above to the most right
bottom corners as shown in Figure 1. There are
the other trends, which are called “Backward”, “Bell”
and “Inverted bell”, possibly influenced by the visitor
characteristics and/or preferences. The similar trends
of visitor circulation will be explained later in detail.

1. Introduction
The topic of visitor circulation in museums and art
galleries has been considered as an important factor
in all aspects of the museum experience (Bigood,
2006; Guy et al. 2010; Kaynar et al. 2009) Circulation
describes how visitors explore a set of exhibits
in a particular space by observing what pathways
the visitors take. A visualization of visitor circulation
can confirm whether visitors circulate the way the
designers intended. The visualization can assist the
designers to arrange a predefined pathway so that
visitors will not miss key exhibits. The well-designed
circulation system can also increase the great number
of return visitors.
Sookhanaphibarn and Thawonmas (2009) proposed
the local and global visualizations aims at presentation
and analysis of visitor behaviors in 3D virtual
museums. The visitor path is displayed with a spectrum
of colors in the form of connecting segments from red
to violet. The color of a particular segment indicates the
passage of time. The drawback of these visualizations
is that they were strictly overlaid on the layout map.
To deal with the varying layouts commonly found in
a museum with many exhibition rooms, visualizations
with an independent layout is an alternative assistant
tool for the visual analytics of circulation patterns.
In this paper, we proposed a new visualization tool to
represent a visitor path and his/her time spent residing

Figure 1: Four trends of circulation: (a) Forward,
(b) Backward, (c) Bell, and (d) Inverted bell.

1.1. Layout-dependent visualization
Most visualization techniques using traditional two
dimensional maps represent visitor trajectories and
their corresponding visit time directly over spatial
layouts. In this paper, we call layout-dependent
visualization as any visualization technique using
the spatial layout of a target area as its graphical
background in visualization. With the layout-dependent
visualization, a circulation pattern is not easily
extracted by a user who is not familiar with the target
layout map.
365

Digital Humanities 2011

The layout-dependent visualization approach burdens
users with a cost of requiring them to recognize
the layout of items and routes by themselves.
Some additional symbols indicating the position and
boundary of items as well as arrowheads indicating
representative routes must be placed in layoutdependent visualization. However, these symbols and
arrowheads conceal visitor traces from users.

2. Design Decision
This paper considers the use of a layout-independent
display for visual analysis of the path and residing time
of the movement data in circulation, named “PARTY”.
PARTY is an abbreviation of Path And Residing Time
display. Taking for example a museum in a 3D virtual
world, the circulation behaviors of visitors moving
through museum of interest are influenced by the items
on which the visitors focus their attention.
Designers of a musuem space require serveral types of
information when examining the circulation behavior of
visitors. These include (1) residing locations, regions,
or item boundaries, (2) visit time intervals near an
item, (3) paths of visited regions, (4) global information
showing multiple visitors residing in a region, and (5)
degrees of their interest. All of these information types
are derived from two data sources: (a) a log file of
visitors’ positions including x-y coordinates and time
and (b) the map of a museum or a floor plan, where the
location of items or the position of rooms is provided
at least.
The design of PARTY aims to represent three
dimensional entities, i.e. a time unit, a visited item, and
a visitor. The horizontal and vertical axes of PARTY
represent time and items which visitor moves through
their boundaries. A stack of visitor stripes is put inside
an item block (row). As shown in Figure 2, there are five
items of interest and three visitors. The stack of three
visitor stripes places inside each item row. The order
of three visitor stripes is consistent thorough five item
rows. Therefore, an PARTY entity represents a visitor
v who stays near item X at time t.

366

Figure 2: A structural design of PARTY.

We arrange the visitor stripes in every stack in
the same order and rank them by the similarity
among their present circulation patterns. Then, we
use the hierarchical clustering technique for finding
the similarity of all pairs of visitor paths. To handle
hundreds of visitors, the representative of each group
of visitors can be used rather than a single visitor. The
representative is derived from the generalized median
defined as the visitor path having the nearest distances
to all.
Besides a path of nearest items versus time, the
proximity distance to the nearest item can be displayed
in PARTY as a degree of visitor’s interest to each
exhibit item. A displaying color is computed using the
observation distance and range based on the location
of all items. For example, given the visitor trace as
shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 represents a visitor trace as
our observation-based time series. The visualization in
Figure 4 consists of the horizontal axis corresponding
to the visit time, the vertical axis indicating an item
belonging to the observation range at a particular
time, and the color showing the observation distance.
This visualization is produced by using the observation
distance and range in the application of a 3D virtual
museum.

Arts and Cultures, of Ritsumeikan University, was
created in Second Life. An objective of RDAP is to
disseminate Japanese costumes, Kimonos, preserved
them in a digital achieving system. We synthesize
the visitor trajectories based on the metaphor of
four animals as mentioned in (Sookhanaphibarn and
Thawonmas, 2009). The total number of synthesized
trajectories is 36 where each visiting style has nine
trajectories.

3.1. Similar Trends of Circulation Patterns
After applying the PARTY approach, visitor trajectories
are transformed into time series data. Discovering
similar trends of circulation patterns is achieved by
a traditional dynamic time warping followed by the
hierarchical clustering. Then, generalized median of
each resulting cluster is calculated. Figure 1 shows
four trends of circulation patterns including:
- a) Forward circulation: this trend illustrates that
visitors prefer to turn right at entrance and move
following the curators-guided path from the the fist
to the last items.
- b) Backward circulation: the direction of this
circulation is backward from the forward one, i.e. turn
left at the beginning.
Figure 3: A representation of a visitor
trace tracked in a 3D virtual museum.

- c) Bell-shape circulation: visitors in this trend prefer
to start and end their visit with the same item, and
they turn right at entrance.
- d) Inverted bell-shape circulation: This trend pattern
is similar to the bell circulation but they turn left at
entrance.
The other view of PARTY displays a stack of
representative stripes of which the width denotes the
size of their categories. The bell-shape circulation
has the largest number of visitors followed by
the backward, forward, and inverted bell-shape
circulations, respectively.

PARTY representing the path of visited items (y-axis)
and his/her interest to items by using color shades from
brightness to darkness (highest to lowest degrees).

Mashing up the Map: Film
Geography and Digital
Cartography in a Cultural Atlas of
Australia
Stadler, Jane

j.stadler@uq.edu.au
University of Queensland

This poster presents research from the online movie
map component of a new digital resource: A Cultural
Atlas of Australia is a collaborative, interdisciplinary
digital humanities research project that uses interactive
cartography and spatial theory to map Australian
narrative fiction across three media forms. Building on
the growing interest in digital cartography and spatial
theory in the humanities, this initiative investigates
the cultural and historical significance of location
and landscape by presenting a national survey of
narrative space spanning Australian novels, films
and plays. The broader project involves Dr Peta
Mitchell from literary geography and Dr Stephen
Carleton from theatre studies in an investigation of
the mediation, remediation and geovisualisation of
locations and landscapes in cinematic, literary, and
theatrical narratives.
There has been a recent surge of popular and critical
interest in linking online mapping with cinema. This
manifests most obviously in a rash of “movie maps”
and online spatial resources such as Robert Allen’s
Going to the Show, which digitally maps a history
of moviegoing in North Carolina (http://www.docs
outh.unc.edu/gtts)1; the National Film and Sound
Archive’s film-location map on the Australian Screen
Online site (http://aso.gov.au/); and Sébastien
Caquard’s work on cinematic cartography in the
Canadian Cinematographic Territories Atlas (http://
www.atlascine.org), which traces the history of
animated maps and virtual globes such as Google
Earth through cinema, examines the technological
interface connecting cinema and cartography, and
maps the locations of cinemas across Canada2. While
many such projects focus on mapping film production
and distribution locations, I seek to focus attention on
developments in movie mapping from since 1980s and
situate such work in relation to cinematic cartography
and the complex interplay of narrative settings and
shooting locations in Australian cinema.

Over the past decade, interactive online mapping
—what D. R. Fraser Taylor has called
“cybercartography”3—has become a particularly
salient issue within cartography, geography, and
humanities research.4 Since Google released its
Google Maps API in 2005, the Google Maps code has
been freely accessible as long as the resulting map
“mashup” remains nonproprietary and in the public
domain. According to William Buckingham and Samuel
Dennis, the development of open source mapping
tools, such as Google Maps, has generated much
interest in the use of maps for “understanding ‘nonmapped’ phenomena (e.g., qualitative data or localized
community information and knowledge).”5
Recent technological developments in digital
cartography make it possible to visualise and to
map the ways in which spatial storytelling produces
and translates space across different media. This
poster presents geovisualisation—in the form of an
interactive online map—as a means by which to map
representations of iconic landscapes and sites within
Australian cinema. The Cultural Atlas of Australia
uses an interdisciplinary method incorporating cultural
geography and textual analysis to interpret, situate,
and contextualise the representation of location. The
project remediates that information in the form of
an online, interactive map that has the potential to
suggest new ways of thinking about location and
landscape and break down traditional typologies of
Australian space. This digital humanities research
advances on traditional cartographic explorations
and representations of space, making it possible to
visualise new perspectives on, intersections between,
and layerings of geographic and textual information.
This aims to enable the identification of regional tropes,
patterns and gaps in spatial representations that may
not have previously been evident in research that
focused on isolated case studies of individual texts,
whether literary, cinematic or theatrical.
As a research tool, the finished map will be searchable
(by medium, location, theme, author, and text) and
will enable users to generate and export their own
maps with information they require. These functions
have the capacity to reveal how cultural meanings
accrue on the landscape, and how our relationship
with, and understanding of, the natural and cultural
environment changes over time. The possibilities
for incorporating participants’ photographs, videos,
and textual accounts of Australian places via
mobile social computing technologies opens up still
more opportunities for the representation of multiple
perspectives.

Geovisualisation has the potential to pose new
questions for spatial analysis and to encourage
broader public engagement in cultural geography.
However, as a form of remediation, it does carry
its own representational problems. As Barbara Piatti
et al have noted, the geography of fiction is an
imprecise one.6 Piatti is speaking about mapping
literary fiction, but the point can be made for all forms
of narrative fiction. The representation of space and
place can never simply be mimetic, but always, to
a greater or lesser degree, creates an imaginative
geography that may correspond to what Piatti calls
the “geospace” (or map space)7 directly, obiquely, or
not at all. Bringing film space into the analytical frame
carries its own set of complexities and ambiguities
because film requires attention to the relationship
between narrative locations and shooting locations.
Beyond the question of impreciseness, the process
of re-presenting narrative locations is a process of
imagining and re-imagining geography that, by its very
nature, is also political.
This project demonstrates that films are more than
representations, more than containers for narrative
symbolism and ideological views and values, and this
extends to any geovisualisation strategy that seeks
to map those texts. Such texts are also generative
—productive of meanings, social relationships and
subject positions. Tom Conley argues in Cartographic
Cinema that cinematic images “produce space
through the act of perception”;8 similarly, film stages
and imaginatively invokes space in ways that
subsequently inflect the meanings readers associate
with actual places. Where film geography and
cinematic cartography enable analysis of locational
information in narrative fiction informed by insights
from geography as well as cinema and cultural
studies, it also builds from the premise that such texts
intervene in the cultural field and alter the perceptual,
ideological, political and practical orientation of readers
and audiences in relation to the physical environment.

Better Software Tools for the
Humanities and the Social
Sciences: a Computer Science
Perspective
Stephenson, Russell

Kantabutra, Vitit

Idaho State University

As computer use has become more prevalent in
all areas of academia, more and more scholars in
the humanities and the social sciences have begun
to realize the potential usefulness of software tools
for their respective areas of scholarship. Many have
become expert in the use of software packages
ranging from database management systems and
GIS to graphical and Web-authoring programs, not
to mention the more common packages for word
processing and the creation of presentations.
These scholars have also, however, discovered
the limitations of current computer software. The
problems range from lack of user friendliness to gross
inefficiency and the inflexibility of database systems,
to the point that important analytical discoveries which
should be made are not made. We believe that these
problems occur because these software packages
were created to serve limited business purposes, and
were co-opted for academic use simply because there
were no better alternatives available.
We will discuss how to improve software for the
humanities and the social sciences by designing
programs based upon computer science principles
that are at the same time grounded in the needs
of humanities scholars, using only those software
libraries, programming languages and paradigms that
truly fit our purposes. In particular, we will first
explain briefly how our Intentionally-Linked Entities
(ILE) database system can be used in humanities
research, social networks and temporal GIS as a
replacement for relational database management
systems. In ILE, relationships are represented using
linked data structures rather than two-dimensional
tables, following the long-term trend in other areas
of computing towards replacing arrays by linked data
structures. Relationships of user-defined complexity
370

Digital Humanities 2011

can be used routinely, and unlike in the relational
model, such relationships are favored over the use of
attributes. We will discuss why using ILE instead of
other databases can lead to more accurate modeling
of historical knowledge, as well as an almost complete
elimination of redundancy.
We will present a new software tool we are developing
that will allow humanities scholars to enter and analyze
data. Humanities scholars often have documents that
contain numerous pieces of interrelated information
that need to be analyzed to reach an understanding
of the material under study. These texts, most often
word processing documents, are developed over a
great deal of time from primary sources, requiring a
researcher many months or years to compile. It is
only after this monumental task that the scholar is
finally able to start piecing together the information
that is key to an understanding of the research topic.
These scholars typically collect data from numerous
documents containing interrelated players, places,
and events. We will present a tool to help gather
these disparate pieces of information into a database.
The user interface for this application follows the
well-known computer programming paradigm of the
Integrated Development Environment (IDE), whereby
a project is created by collecting relevant documents
(source files, resource files, and supporting data) into
a single project file defined by the user. As documents
are added to the project, they can be analyzed by
selecting text and creating entities and assigning
relationships to those entities via an ILE database.
The text and matching text in other documents may
then be color-coded to make it easier to keep track
of the entities that have been created. The entities/
relationships will be stored in an ILE database and
displayed as a tree next to the document window.
We will show an early prototype of this application
as well as give an overview of the fundamental
components: project browser, document windows,
entity/relationship trees, and the ILE database. We will
also discuss applications for geographically-integrated
history and its relationships to social networks and
researcher-guided textual analysis.

The Ethics of Virtual Cultural
Representation
Szabo, Victoria
ves4@duke.edu
Duke University

Spatial/temporal platforms for visualizing humanities
data offer scholars new ways of representing the
people, places, and material objects they study within
a larger cultural context. These environments can be
used to illuminate the lives of individual people, groups
and objects over time, present archival materials in
geographical or topological context, model theories
of structural change over time, and annotate lived
experience of the physical world in realtime. While
digital maps, virtual worlds, and location-based mobile
applications differ in how they represent information,
each has attributes that both lend them authority and
power, and potentially provoke ethical challenges. This
project attempts to articulate some of those features in
order to develop guidelines for ethical rich media map
and virtual world construction in the humanities.
As digital humanities scholars we sometimes adopt
tools created for purposes different from our own.
It is our responsibility to understand the rhetorical
effects of the communications strategies we adopt
for our teaching and research. In the case of
spatial/temporal platforms like Google Earth, the
built-in assumptions about content-presentation rely
on consistently abstracted information. Because
humanities “data” is often heterogeneous, ambiguous,
incomplete, qualitative and partial, it does not always fit
well with a “vector” platform that demands specificity.
The temptation to assign a point, a line, a path, a
region, or a date can be powerful when assembling
an archive. At the same time, the “bitmap” aspects of
a rich media environment, both the panoptic stitched
imagery of satellite views and street views, and the
user-generated annotations, naturalize and potentially
humanize they system’s affect, lending it further power
as a tool for spatial-temporal representation.
To combat these totalizing tendencies, we can
understand our assemblages as database driven,
hypermediated historical narratives, whose organizing
principles of space and time offer a thru-line for our
content. Doing so requires that we show the seams,
make the construction produces visible in the final
product, and allow the user to deconstruct, or drilldown in our creations. The separation of presentation
371

Digital Humanities 2011

and data that is a mainstay for coders is difficult to
maintain in this context, but is a useful guide when
thinking about display possibilities. The goal is to
reveal the ways in which a map or virtual-world based
presentation is a coherent, but not exclusive, narrative
built up out of and illustrated by the materials at hand.
Ideally the presentation layer can be added onto and
changed based on new information, additional data, or
other perspectives.
This approach to spatial/temporal project creation has
implications for how we construct, share, and annotate
digital map and virtual world based project, which
will be elaborated here through three examples. Each
project includes both quantitative and qualitative “data”
sources, georeferenced content, and a focus on a
specific historical or cultural group. While none of these
projects are specifically ethnographic or documentary
in focus, each raises ethical challenges for the digital
media author representing a populated environment.
Example Projects:
1. Multimedia Mapping: Muhuru Bay, Kenya, was
undertaken by a team of faculty, postdocs, students,
and community leaders. This complex project involved
the ISIS Program, Duke Global Health researchers,
DukeEngage, a summer enrichment program for
undergraduates, and the WISER Foundation, an NGO.
Some of the issues that arose here were around the
use of demographic and survey data reflecting the local
population, testimonials by local children on their lived
experience as female students in the community, the
exposure of selected aspects of the local infrastructure,
including a latrine quality survey as part of a publicly
accessible rich media map. This project also involved
the creation of what were literally the first contemporary
maps of the region showing location and sub- location
boundaries of the various provinces and villages in
Muhuru Bay, and well as a research study on local
children’s perspectives on mapping as part of study of
the social geographies of AIDS and HIV.
2. “The Walltown Neighborhood History Project,”
is a community mapping project, involved seventh
and eighth grade students in a summer campbased experience which involved overlaying historical
census data information and fire insurance maps
onto a contemporary Google map of their community.
This project was intended to promote technology
literacy among the students, to provide a chance
for local community members to learn more about
their neighborhood’s history and contribute their own
content, and for Duke researchers to leverage an
archive of historical “Digital Durham” materials in a
highly accessible, public fashion. Challenges here
include the public presentation of historical data in
372

a public, georeferenced context, the presentation of
historically racialized demographic language to be
read in the non-scholarly context of a Google map,
the production of a local and collective identity for
the Walltown residents via expressive and quantitative
(GIS) data, and the potential exposure of individuals on
the public web, even granting their informed consent.
3. The “Virtual Haiti Project,” is part of a Humanities
Lab focused on Haiti and supported by Duke’s
Franklin Humanities Institute. Students in a class called
“Representing Haiti” are asking the question of what
it means to create a “Haiti Island” in Second Life, and
what it is and is not appropriate to model there. We
need to understand how a geo-referenced constructed
environment exceeds the bounds of our intentionality,
which in this case is to create a Kreyòl language
learning space and virtual front end to a library of
Haiti-related, downloadable resources alongside a set
of coordinated maps related to visualizing the Haitian
diaspora. Perhaps more fruitful than direct mirror-world
strategies in-world be non-representational strategies
such as psychogeographies, associative place-based
meditations, and imaginative transformations or
reconstructions. Yet why not also a Port-au-Prince
StreetView?

this study is visualizing ontology-based name authority
file using Topic Map and providing it with API. In this
paper, we will describe in detail.

3. Definition of Ontology
An important goal of this archive is to select and
view each material through an understanding of the
various materials and the relationship between the
characteristics related to them. To achieve this, we
decided to use ontology relating the various items in
this project:
1. Defining concepts, characteristics, and meanings of
various items
2. Aiming at systematizing various concepts and items
in the world
3. Aiming at generality, which makes materials
reusable, and shared knowledge

1. Abstract
In this research, we constructed an ontology-based
name authority file using a topic map, and then, using
API and other Web services, we looked into using this
with navigational systems .The name authority file was
created and provided through API services. By using
this service, it is possible for developing navigation
and analyzing tool of Digital Cultural Heritages to
have a comprehensive name list of historic personal
names and artists. These API are used for Digital
Cultural Heritages of digitized anthropological material,
old photographs.

2. Introduction
While there have heretofore been various forms of
Digital Cultural Heritage, even for digitized and stored
materials it has been typical to select materials through
a list or by alphabetical search. However, in situations
such as for historical documents, it is preferable to be
able to select materials by searching for documents
that deal with related individuals, social organizations,
historical events or periods. In particular, a proper noun
should be controlled as authority file.
For this reason, in this study, an ontology-based name
authority file —which defines the relationship between
people, organizations and places—was created. And
the information was stored in standardized ontology
language. We adopted Topic Maps for constructing
name authority file and API system providing it for
digital cultural heritage.
There are some examples of ontology-based name
authority file using Topic Map. The unique features of

4. Describing items with rules and in a language based
on certain regulations
In Greek, ontology originally means existence and has
been frequently used in philosophy. However, with the
development of the study of artificial intelligence and
knowledge engineering since the late 20th century, it
began to be used as a term referring to a semantic
systematization method for various items in the world
in order to facilitate its understanding by machines.
Meanwhile, when the Semantic Web was proposed
by Tim Berners-Lee as a more effective method to
connect fragments of information on the Web through
the spread of the Internet in the late 1990s, ontology
was used as a term to refer to the methodology used
to describe content created on the Web with more
regulated rules and language.
Various types of ontologies have been developed
through the course of time, such as ―Upper ontology
aiming at the systematization of various items
in the world based on philosophical discussions,
Domain ontology developed to express the edifice of
knowledge in a specific domain (mainly for industrial
use), and Web ontology developed to systematize
information and knowledge on the Web.
“Upper ontology and Domain ontology are provided to
construct concepts 1), 3), and 4) aiming at 2) defined
above. Web ontology initially had the practical purpose
to develop item 4) in order to define the relationship
between information items on creating contents using
method 1) to achieve item 3), which can be seen in the
combination of the Dublin Core and RDF technologies.
The ontology of CIDOC CRM –used to describe the
metadata of cultural resources–seems to belong to this
373

Digital Humanities 2011

type. Recent advances made in Web ontology aim at
the semantic systematization of content on the Web,
which was its initial objective. In this context, it may
be said that it has advanced in the area of item 2) by
replacing the world with the Web. However, how the
system of the concepts on the Web and that of the
things in the real world are unified as the former is a
reflection on the latter remains to be seen.
This study systematizes item 2) for historical
information with method 1) in anticipation of the union
of these in the future and aims at item 3) by using
item 4), which can be unified with Web ontology, etc.
in the future. As for now, we are mainly focusing
on implementing items 1) and 2). In particular, we
designed name authority file based on the above
mentioned definition on ontology.

4. Constructing Ontology Using Topic Map

4.1. Introduction about Topic Map
We adopted topic map to constructing above
mentioned ontology-based name authority file. Topic
maps that represent ontology use the ISO/IEC JTC1
SC34 established ISO standard, which is still being
revised, but as of April 2009 some parts have not
yet received JIS standardization. Topic maps are a
technique for classifying, organizing and making easily
visible information and knowledge, and play a role
similar to the index of a book for displaying information
in space. It is possible to model and process the
relations between subjects in the problematic areas,
relations between information resources, such as
Topics, Association and Occurrence with a computer.
In order to identify and discern the subjects,
topic maps have a mechanism known as PSI
(Published Subject Identifier). PSI, as a subject
identifier, allocates and publicizes a unique IRI
(Internationalized Resource Identifier) to each subject.
Placed above the indicated address of the IRI,
and serving as a descriptive information resource is
the Published Subject Indicator, or PSD (Published
Subject Descriptor), which allows the understanding of
what the subject represents. For this project, as PSI
was used, subjects were not given their own name or
alias; rather they could be identified and discerned by
their IRI.

4.2. Creation of Topic Map
Information relating to the photographer, scholar and
noble family was collected to use navigation and
analyzing for old photograph. Especially for information
374

that needs to be shared, information necessary for
multiple people is gathered. Information gathered in
this manner is described in the creation of topic maps.
Information gathered by multiple people is shown
in table 1 under the entries of "name,"
"reading," "nationality," "occupation," "birth and
death," "biography," "hometown," "place of residence,"
"attached organization / group" and "title." These items
are candidates for topics when creating the topic
map. After completion of the topic map, navigation will
become possible based on these subjects.
The three elements of which Topic maps are
composed are mainly used to express a variety of
subjects (topics), express relations between topics
(Associations), and to link information resources
related to topics (Occurrences).
These structures are adapted as shown in Table
1. The names, various related items, and reciprocal
relations of items regarding the ontology at first
can be thought of as topics for topic maps. Also,
for name sources, each "person" and "place" and
the relation among people (Associations) is adapted.
Furthermore, as links to specific information resources,
"birth and death," "biography," "related URL/URI" etc.,
correspond to appearance (Occurrences).
In addition, it is possible to classify information stored
for these (Topics), (Associations) and (Occurrences).
For the first topic (Topics) various "forms" were
established; Topic Types, which represents the topic
"form," for (Associations), defining the relation type are
Association Types and Association Role Types, and for
(Occurrence), Occurrence Types expresses the type
of appearance.
The specific items of these "forms" can be expressed,
for Topic Types, "Country," "Person," "place name,"
"organization/group," and "occupation" etc.
Furthermore, Association Types are established
showing various relations such as "friendship
relation," "marital relation," "student/teacher relation,"
"workplace relation", and "filial relation," Association
Role Types express the role of each topic that
produces relations, such as "significant role," "brother
(sister) role," "wife role," "child role," and "pupil role,"
etc.
Next, Occurrence Types are established, "reading
of name," "reading of surname," "name in roman
alphabet," "surname in roman alphabet," "personal
relationship," "relationship period," "birthplace,"
"source," "role," etc. Based on these items information
is structured.

Digital Humanities 2011

Personal topics such as parent-child relation, fraternal
relation, matrimonial relation, friendship association
etc. are expressed through the lines leading into and
out of the personal topics.
After creating the topic map, based on these forms
queries and navigation are possible, and compared to
semantic processing more meaningful searches can
be conducted.

5. An Overview of Iconographic Analysis Using
Authoritative Information.
In this study, as shown in Fig. 1, an ontologybased name authority file was constructed, and that
information was distributed through API. For name
authority file, focusing on photographers, scholars
and noble family, roughly 3000 names were entered
into a DB system. This authoritative personal name
information was mainly made from standardized
reference materials used in museums, libraries and
archives, and created from element sets which allowed
the sharing of information in this study, and API was
added to the database to enable external searching.
In addition, as an external system a picture annotator
was created using this API.

Figure. 1. Mutual Relationships among Topics

In this study, a simple API was designed to make
personal information taken from a reference DB
searchable. By using this API, it is possible to use even
personal name information controlled by an external
system.
There were four Parameters that could be used
(personal name, birth year and year of death, family,
personal ID) to search, and the eight types of data
that could be obtained from search were (personal
name, personal ID, birth year or year of death, family,
biography, related individuals and their relations, and
source). It was possible to identify even people and
families that had a unique ID, as well as individuals
who shared the same name. Furthermore, by using
the controlling ID, semantic interchange with an
independent external system could be made possible.
The goal of the current design is not to have all
fields of the DB searchable by semantic search, but to
provide those fields thought to be frequently utilized by
external applications simply. If a higher order search is
desired, it can be performed from the editing UI of the
authoritative information DB. The XML-RPC was used
for the API protocol.

6. Designing Name Autholity File for Navigation
and Analysing Image
In the last section, we constructed an ontology-based
name authority file using a topic map. It is possible
to use these to confirm interpersonal relationships
and relationships between people and organizations
while looking at a graph. In this research, we
constructed a name authority file concerning scholar,
photographers, etc. with a topic map. Fig 1 is a graph
showing these people’s interpersonal relationships
and their relationships. This chart mainly shows the
relationships between the parties in relation to the
anthropology materials. In this way, it is possible to

375

Digital Humanities 2011

use a personal name information authority using topic
maps for navigation systems.

7. Results and Issues
As seen above, ontology-based name authority file
utilizing topic map and API for Digital Cultural Heritage
was explained through application. In this study,
ontology-based name authority file was constructed.
By using topic maps, related people, can be clarified,
and materials can be viewed. And API accelerated
utilization of name authority file

Figure. 2. Relationship among photographers

Fig 2 is a graph showing relationships of
photographers. Also, as shown in Fig 3, it is possible
to show detailed information regarding these personal
names, etc. by clicking on the personal name icons.

In addition, by allocating URI to personal topics,
personal identification can be performed by URI, not
just by name, and by using the merge feature it is
possible to share data from other topic maps. Also,
by publishing with PSI information can be shared by
other RDF and topic maps. For IRI, which kinds of
character strings are appropriate is a matter for future
consideration.
Concerning visualization, as demonstrated in fig. 2,
visualization of relationships is possible. However, this
causes problems such as the difficulty in recognizing
relations that appear between more than three topics
to arise. This problem also occurs with other viewers,
and further study is necessary.
It is also necessary to consider whether and how
to share the topic map created for this project with
other projects and databases. As mentioned earlier, as
each topic is given a universal URI, it is necessary to
consider how it is necessary to link to other topic maps.

Figure. 3. Name Authority File

Furthermore, it is possible to assign annotations to
the materials, as well as to assign personal name
information which has been regulated by the topic
maps. It is also possible to provide information to
the annotations using the regulated personal name
information. With this, it is possible to search through
material annotation information from the personal
name information that has been regulated by the topic
maps.
It is possible to combine this topic mapped personal
name information with the digital cultural heritage
main body, but it is also possible to put it to use
through API. By using API, it is possible to use this
information for navigation and annotation with other
digital cultural heritages. This makes it possible to
regulate the information and analyze the materials
using information which defines the relationships.

376

Furthermore, for this project, previously created
information was converted into a topic map, but in the
future it will be necessary to design a system to handle
increased topics for Digital Cultural Heritage. Along
with the need to store more materials, a system to
increase information is necessary.

The Wheaton College Digital
History Project: Digital
Humanities and Undergraduate
Research
Tomasek, Kathryn

1. Digital History
Can undergraduates contribute meaningfully to a longterm digital history project? What role can transcription
and markup play in the undergraduate history
curriculum? How can collaborations among instructor,
archivist, and technologist contribute to undergraduate
research? What is the role of collaborations with other
small liberal arts colleges and with large research
universities?
All too often, students majoring in non-science
disciplines have little exposure to computational
thinking and working with computer code.  At the
same time, digital methods of analysis exert growing
influence on the practice of many disciplines in the
humanities and social sciences.  The Wheaton College
Digital History Project seeks to bridge this gap using
tools from Digital Humanities.

2. The Wheaton College Digital History Project
Since fall 2004, undergraduates in History courses at
Wheaton College have been transcribing and marking
up nineteenth-century documents from the Wheaton
College Archives and Special Collections for digital
publication. The opportunity to begin this work arose
when a confluence of events combined new interest
in and experience with the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI) at Wheaton College and the acquisition of the
pocket diaries of Eliza Baylies Wheaton. Beginning
in January 2004, Wheaton College collaborated with
Mount Holyoke College to host a two-part conference
that explored uses of TEI in teaching and research
at liberal arts colleges. The conference included
instruction in TEI from Julia Flanders and Syd Bauman
of the Women Writers Project at Brown University.
Our first effort at incorporating TEI into a course
occurred in fall 2004. Students in an introductory
course on women's history, U.S. Women to 1869,

377

Digital Humanities 2011

learned about the economic uncertainties in the lives
of unmarried white women when they transcribed and
marked up the journal of Maria E. Wood, the daughter
of a Maine Baptist minister. Each student was assigned
to transcribe a set of pages from the journal, and then
groups of students marked up the entire journal using
themes from the course: family, work, religion, death
and mourning. At the end of the course, the students
expressed a sense of having gotten to know Wood and
having understood the past better than they ever had
before.
In subsequent semesters and summers, students have
collaborated with members of the faculty and staff
to create digital editions of the diaries of Eliza B.
Wheaton. The three students who worked together in
summer 2005 became a community of enthusiastic
historians. As they transcribed the travel journal and
pocket diaries of Eliza Baylies Wheaton, they used
their spare time to explore the town of Norton,
especially its cemeteries, where they looked for the
birth and death dates of people mentioned in the
documents. During subsequent summers, student
workers continued to transcribe and mark related
documents.
In spring 2009, the project took a new turn, as
students in the research methods course for History
majors began to transcribe and mark up pages
from the daybook that Laban Morey Wheaton kept
between 1828 and 1859. This book records financial
transactions that reflect some of the range of
Wheaton’s business interests during these forty years,
including agricultural pursuits and rentals for land
and houses as well as tax collections, fees for legal
services, and the operation of a general store in
Norton, Massachusetts.

3. Undergraduate Research

3.1. Teaching Module
Students examine Laban Morey Wheaton’s daybook
alongside his account ledger and cashbooks that
date from the same period to get a fuller idea of
the financial context for the daybook transactions.
Each student transcribes a two-page spread using
a Google spreadsheet to facilitate keeping track of
the tabular data. The academic technology liaison
converts these documents into XML files that students
open in oXygen and mark up using the guidelines of
the TEI. Students code the transactions for personal
names, commodities, amounts purchased, amounts
charged, and mode of payment—cash or credit.

378

In another class meeting, the academic technology
liaison demonstrates visualization tools to show
students examples of ways to display results of
querying the files. Students write short History Engine
episodes based on the transaction of their choice, in
preparation for writing papers based on the data they
have transcribed, coded, and queried.

4. Collaborations: Archiving, Pedagogy and
Research
Since Wheaton College is a liberal arts college that
prioritizes teaching and learning, including students
in the process of scholarly research makes sense,
as does promoting a collaborative pedagogy in
which members of the faculty and staff come
together to deploy their complementary expertise in
leading students through the process of research
and writing. The College Archivist and Curator of
Special Collections identifies the documents to be
transcribed in collaboration with the instructor, who
uses her scholarly expertise to identify secondary
sources that will help the students contextualize and
interpret their findings. The archivist guides students
to sources that help establish the local context for the
documents. The Technology Liaison for Humanities
instructs students in markup and querying data. He
also performs backstage transformations that make
the data available in appropriate forms for students to
mark up, query, and manipulate.
Students contribute more than their labor since they
bring to the documents a perspective distinct from
those of the archivist, instructor, and technologist.
Their very unfamiliarity with the historical context
allows them to bring to the project questions that
enable new insights into the implications of the data
that they help create. Whilst we do not expect them to
contribute to the digital humanities at the same level
as graduate students, we do value their participation,
and we hope to prepare them for advanced study in
the field.

5. Next Steps: Transcribe Wheaton
Since we have developed a workflow and are
comfortable with using this assignment as a teaching
module, we are piloting targeted crowd-sourcing to
speed transcription. Students continue to transcribe,
mark up, query, and write about transactions from the
daybook in courses.
Transcribe Wheaton, modeled on the Transcribe
Bentham project at University College London, will
provide a portal and tools to allow students and

Digital Humanities 2011

friends of Wheaton College to participate in digitization
of financial documents from the Wheaton Family
Papers either as part of their coursework or as a
volunteer contribution to the ongoing work of the
Wheaton College Digital History Project. We hope that
faculty members in courses in Anthropology, Computer
Science, Economics, and other fields will use the
teaching module to employ transcription and markup
in their courses. We also hope that graduates of the
college will assist in the project, and we expect to be
able to open transcription beyond the college by 2012.

6. The Long Term

serves as a brochure for the project, we hope to include
additional features by the time of the conference,
including links to student writing about individual
transactions from the daybook, as well as a portal for
transcribers.
We share our project as an example of a long-term
project in digital history that includes undergraduates
as significant partners in the digitization and
interpretation of a hidden collection that offers insight
into the relationship between capitalist accumulation
and women's education in the nineteenth-century
United States.

When we began transcribing the pocket diaries of
Eliza Baylies Wheaton, we chose TEI because we
appreciated the flexibility of XML and we liked the
idea of performing transcription once and being
able to manipulate the data thereafter. That initial
decision has affected the choices we made as we
began transcribing the financial records, which are
much more abundant in the Wheaton Family Papers
collection than are diaries and letters. Such records
are in fact abundant in many archives, yet they are
underutilized by historians, in part because of their
inaccessibility. We hope that our project will contribute
to the development of standards for TEI markup of
tabular records, thus encouraging similar projects that
will increase the accessibility of historical financial
records and other tabular data.
Since our project combines archival, pedagogical,
and scholarly purposes, we find ourselves negotiating
constantly among them. The collaborative nature of
our project and the multiple varieties of expertise and
interest brought to it by each member of the team
necessitate ongoing consultations among the archivist,
instructor, and technologists. Like many projects in
digital humanities, ours requires a certain amount
of comfort with technology from the archivist and
instructor, combined with an equivalent amount of
comfort with the humanities from the technologists.
Because ours is a small liberal arts college, we rely
on collaborations with other institutions to support our
project. Our technologists, for example, have spent
2010 collaborating with colleagues from other liberal
arts colleges as well as from Brown University and the
University of Virginia as they plan a presentation tool
for TEI documents produced at small colleges. And
members of our project team have taken additional
courses with Julia Flanders and Syd Bauman as we
continue to hone our TEI skills.

"The Start of a New Chapter":
Serialization and the 19thCentury Novel
Truxaw, Ellen

ellen.truxaw@gmail.com
Stanford University

Although there have been numerous efforts to theorize
the novel, little work exists on the chapter. Previous
work has focused on the chapter as a device to
structure the internal events of a narrative, as well
as a means to affect narrative pace. In his essay
“The Chapter in Fiction” Philip Stevick discusses the
chapter as a structural unit containing events; however,
common critical assumptions have been divided over
whether to treat the chapter as a bibliographical
or formal unit. This study identifies the chapter as
a formal unit that is influenced by historical and
bibliographic pressures. The chapter's ubiquity and
seeming formlessness have made it a difficult object
of study with traditional tools of literary analysis,
but techniques in humanities computing provide new
access to the stylistics of the chapter.
In his book, The Sense of an Ending, Frank Kermode
describes novels as “fictive models of the temporal
world” in which readers must find a balance between
realistic representations of time and necessary
narrative deviations from this chronicity (Kermode
54-55). My stylistic analysis of the chapter focuses on
grammatical and semantic temporal markers at the
beginnings and ends of chapters. By investigating the
stylistic trends in 19th century authors’ treatment of
narrative time, I argue that historical, literary-historical,
and bibliographic forces shape the form and function
of the chapter across 19th century.
By the Nineteenth Century, the novel had been
established as a largely chapter-based form; however,
pressures of serialized publication demanded that
authors reconsider the way they structured both their
narratives and chapters. In a letter to Elizabeth
Gaskell, Charles Dickens offers advice on how to write
successful material for serial publication. He writes
about what would happen if text that is not intended for
serial publication gets divided and serialized anyway.
He writes, "The scheme of the chapters, the manner of
introducing the people, the progress of the interest, the
places in which the principal places fall, are hopelessly
against it. It would seem as though the story were
380

never coming, and hardly ever moving. There must be
a special design to overcome that specially trying mode
of publication" (Grubb 143). Dickens insists that serial
publication required novelists to rethink the way they
structure their narratives. This study analyzes both
serialized and non-serialized 19th century novels to
ascertain the extent to which serialization affected the
chapter as a formal unit.
Using distant reading techniques, I have studied
stylistic trends in thirty-six Nineteenth Century novels:
Non-serialized -- Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion,
Frankenstein, Ivanhoe, The Entail (1823), The Last
Man, Pelham (1828), The Heir of Redclyffe (1853),
Barchester Towers (1856), Jane Eyre, Villette, Henry
Esmond, Tancred (1847), Mary Barton (1849) Mill
on the Floss (1860), The Coral Island (1858), Black
Beauty (1877), Dracula (1897) Serialized-- Jack
Sheppard, Barnaby Rudge, David Copperfield, Vanity
Fair, Hard Times, North and South, Our Mutual Friend,
Far From the Madding Crowd, The Woman in White,
The Moonstone, Middlemarch, Beauchamp's Career,
Can You Forgive Her?, The Way We Live Now,
Wives and Daughters, David Copperfield, Treasure
Island, The Trumpet Major. I selected novels based on
their canonicity and tried to study works from a wide
historical range. By close-reading chapter beginnings
and endings, I have created classification categories
for the main "types" of beginning and endings. These
"types" treat diegetic temporality in distinct ways
through different verb tenses and deictic markers. I
classified chapter beginnings into the following types:
- Type 0 — The narrator describes a character or
place without direct references to diegetic time.
- Type 1 — The narrator starts the chapter on "the next
day"
- Type 2 — The narrator begins the chapter where
he leaves off, or in medias res often using the past
progressive
- Type 3 — The narrator summarizes the events of an
interim period before entering a scene in the chapter.
- Type 4 — The narrator uses phrases like "one day"
to place the reader in an undefined place within
diegetic time.
I differentiate these types based on defining
grammatical and semantic markers that indicate the
author’s different representations of temporality. I read
the beginnings of every chapter from each of the novels
and classify them into the category into which they
fit best. I then compare the relative frequencies of
types of chapter beginnings and endings using χ2 tests
to determine whether significant differences between

Digital Humanities 2011

serialized and non-serialized novels appeared. These
differences proved significant. Notably, the Type 3 and
4 beginnings occurred significantly more frequently
in non-serialized novels than serialized novels. The
difference in the relative frequencies of beginning types
in serialized and non-serialized novels suggests not
only that the chapter exists as a formal unit of narrative,
but that historical and bibliographic changes affect this
form.
Collaborating with Matthew Jockers and the Stanford
Literary Lab, I am continuing to look at trends in
a wider data set of novels. Matt Jockers has built
software with the primary purpose of classifying the
beginning and ending paragraphs of chapters in novels
from the Chadwyck Healey 19th century British Fiction
database. By obtaining data on over 250 novels, I aim
to investigate the prevalence of particular beginning
and end types across the 19th century as a whole to
elucidate how and why authors divide their narratives
as they do as well as to understand the role narrative
time plays in these divisions.

Adapting EATS for
Crowdsourcing: Register
Medicorum Medii Aevi
Viglianti, Raffaele

raffaele.viglianti@kcl.ac.uk
King's College London, United Kingdom

The Register Medicorum Medii Aevi (RMMA) is an
active pilot project at King's College London that seeks
to lay the foundations for an interdisciplinary online
register of doctors in the middle ages. It is common for
similar kinds of historical online resources to prepare a
database out of a large collection of scholarly findings.
RMMA, instead, aims to create a growing database
which is populated over time by various scholars
and students to make their findings accessible on
the web. In order to pursue this task, the prototype
for this pilot must allow data insertion from a wider
group than the project partners alone; therefore several
crowdsourcing principles are applied and extensive
user testing is being undertaken. This poster will
show solutions to the main challenges encountered
in the design of the database and in adapting EATS,
a Django application for authority records, for wider
online use.

2. Overview
Researchers from different areas of medieval studies
are likely to encounter information in primary sources
about medici, the physicians of the time. Information
about medici and their practices was recorded in a
variety of documents; they would often travel across
cultures, which can serve as indication of their high
value. This has produced many sources from different
cultures and in different languages. Because different
areas of study often gravitate around geographical,
cultural and linguistic divisions, it is challenging to
investigate the movements of people and knowledge
across these barriers. RMMA explores how digital
publication can help in exchanging reliable information
between researchers in such areas and currently
involves experts on Anglo-Saxon, Arabic, Armenian,
Greek, Jewish, Latin materials that provide information
about doctors, and medical knowledge in the medieval
period.
To address this issue, the project is developing a
web application that will allow to (1) insert information
about medici from primary and secondary sources; (2)
381

Digital Humanities 2011

handle different opinions about the same individuals;
and (3) connect to prosopographical projects that deal
with a similar historical time-frame and with historical
geographical resources. 1

the dichotomy between user and authority must be
maintained: the scholar will insert data as a certain user
controlling the authority that represents him or herself.

3. Technologies Involved
The application is built using Django,2 a Python
open source web application framework aimed at
simplifying development through a reusable set of
common libraries and components. Developers can
code their own application to be re-used within other
Django frameworks, which is a factor that contributes
towards the web framework's success. EATS (Entity
Authority Tool Set) is a Django application developed
by Jamie Norrish at the New Zealand Electronic Text
Centre (NZETC) and "is now used to manage the
30,000+ entities represented in the NZETC online
collection of significant New Zealand and Pacific
Island texts" (Norrish 2007). The application targets
issues usually faced by libraries, such as ambiguous
identifiers based on names and titles. By improving
on traditional authority systems where one identifier
groups different entries describing the same entity,
EATS allows the linking together of different collections
and authorities, introduces user management and
provides greater scope for disambiguation. RMMA
found that EATS's approach could greatly contribute
to the objectives of the project's web application,
specifically in handling information about the same
entities coming from multiple sources.
Most EATS top-level components have been adapted
for RMMA's purposes: Entities are database tables
that must be associated to one or more Authorities.
Authorities may then make Property Assertions
that associate Entities to specific default or userdefined properties. In RMMA, Entities are medici,
patients, employers, locations, institutions, etc., while
Authorities are the contributors of the data, such as
authors of narrative secondary sources or contributors
inserting information anew from a primary source
(note that in this case the authority remains the
contributor and not the primary source; in theory,
different contributors can enter different information
from the same primary source, intentionally leaving
room for debate). Property Assertions in RMMA reflect
statements such as: Authority contributor states that
Entity medicus has name name, or similar. Finally,
users of the system are able to insert data for one or
more authorities, which is particularly useful if one user
is entering information from a number of secondary
sources. When users enter data discovered by
themselves, however, they are acting like authorities.
Even in this case, for the purpose of the system,
382

Fig 1. This graph shows the role of users in controlling
authorities and different authorities declaring
statements (property assertions) about the same entity.

4. Adapting EATS Interface for a Wider
Audience
The default EATS interface for data entry is designed
for completeness and may require some training for
the inexperienced users. After all, this interface is likely
to be used by personnel for populating the database
and most of the design effort is better spent on the
querying interface that end users will see. In the case
of RMMA the project is vastly adapting the interface,
as data entry will be an essential part of the end
user experience. The project has been looking at other
initiatives in the Digital Humanities and Digital Library
fields that are adopting crowdsourcing for collecting
data.3 Crowdsourcing consists of outsourcing specific
tasks to be performed by volunteers via a web
application. The term is a neologism coined in 2006 in
an article on Wired, in which the author claims that the
current pervasiveness of technology has reduced the
gap between professionals and amateurs. Rose Holley
(2010) argues that crowdsourcing could be of great
value for Digital Libraries, especially for accomplishing
goals that would require a large number of staff, time
and resources. In order to attract contributions from
volunteers it is necessary to follow certain principles
when designing the web application that they will use.
Holley outlines some "tips for crowdsourcing" out of
her personal experience and by analysing successful
projects.
RMMA is not strictly a crowdsourcing project, as
submissions will be reviewed by a board before being
published. The reason for this is twofold: on one

Digital Humanities 2011

hand it is desirable to control what gets into the
database, though successful crowdsourcing initiatives
usually found volunteers good at policing each other
and keeping away malicious users; on the other
hand, RMMA attempts to promote the use of the
database as a publishing environment for scholars.
The presence of a board, therefore, offers a model
closer to peer-reviewed publishing, which is not a novel
approach, as some academic projects have already
been experimenting along similar lines.4

Norman, Donald A. (1988). The design of everyday
things. Cambridge (MA, USA): MIT Press.

Despite these plans, which move RMMA away from
the definition of crowdsourcing, many of the principles
outlined by Holley are of great importance. Specifically,
she suggests having a clear and ambitious goal,
acknowledging contributors, reporting on the progress
of the resource and making the application easy,
reliable, quick and intuitive. Current efforts focus on
improving the application by simplifying the interface
and making clear paths for data entry depending on
the nature of information that the users intend to
store. To insure that the interface design is effective,
several stages of user testing are planned.5 RMMA
is organising a number of workshops in Europe and
in the United States as part of the pilot project. This
is intended to reach the desired audience and at the
same time have the user test the resource and collect
feedback during the following few weeks.

5. The Future
RMMA hopes to use its web application to involve
middle ages medical researchers from different fields
separated by specific geographical and linguistic
studies. The database aims to be both a growing
collection compiled by interested participants and
a reliable publication of information about relevant
individuals from the middle age worlds. It is therefore
necessary to include crowdsourcing principles in
the design of the web application to achieve the
proposed goals. While not a stated aim of the project,
the possibility of tracing of the movement across
cultures of individuals conveying and acquiring medical
knowledge would be a desirable and likely outcome of
far-reaching historical interest.

discussed in Holley 2010.
4. An exemplary project is Suda on Line: Byzantine Lexicography
(SOL) <http://www.stoa.org/sol>, which involves more than a
hundred scholars for the translation and editing of the Suda,
a 10th century CE Byzantine encyclopedia. The large size of
Suda (30,000+ entries) has encouraged the involvement of a
large number of collaborators to work online. Submissions to
the database are made immediately available to the public, but
SOL implements a colour code that differentiate just submitted
entries and entries that have been reviewed and approved by
a the editors overtime. This mixed system simplifies submission
whilst allowing a control of the quality of the publication.

This admirable invention [computation by logarithms]
added to the ingenious algorithm of the Indians, by
reducing to a few days the labour of several months,
doubles—if we may so speak—the life of astronomers,
and spares them the errors and disgust inseparable
from long calculations . . .
–Pierre Simon de LaPlace (1749-1827) Système du
Monde, liv. iv, chap. iv
In addition to offering the possibility of new forms
of scholarship beyond the traditional article or
monograph, digital humanities and the computational
tools developed as part of many digital humanities
projects allow scholars to practice an accelerated
hermeneutics and analysis on ever larger collections
of texts and other cultural artifacts. Most projects that
create scholarly digital editions of important corpora
are consciously addressing a range of research issues
in their respective fields and disciplines. Many of
these projects are now also developing components
and applying computational tools to exploit their new
resources with the goal of solving those problems in an
efficient and effective way.
Napier’s logarithms (1614) eased the efforts of early
modern astronomers. Today, computational tools
promise to accomplish lengthy mechanical tasks of
review and notation that generations of scholars have
done by hand. Effective methods now exist that will aid
trained professionals to see into the heart and structure
of digital corpora.
Our project is associated with two major digital
editions based at Indiana University: the Chymistry
of Isaac Newton Project (http://www.chymistry.org),
led by William R. Newman, general editor and co384

investigator, which is publishing a digital edition
of one hundred nineteen alchemical manuscripts
written by Isaac Newton, thirty-two of which are
now online; and the Swinburne Project (http://
www.swinburneproject.org/), edited by Walsh, which
is publishing the works of Victorian poet and critic
Algernon Charles Swinburne.
The National Science Foundation has funded a
three-year project (2009–12, #0620868) to develop
computational tools for the analysis of the alchemical
language in Newton alchemical corpus. We are
investigating the usefulness of methods from
computational linguistics, information retrieval, and
network sciences for the analysis of the contents of the
Newton corpus and the visualization of its structures.
We have been running experiments on IU’s Teragrid
supercomputer system and at the Computational
Linguistics Lab for the last two years.
We have developed a working suite of analytical tools
that support effective real-time investigation of the
semantics and structure of the corpus. Data from our
analytical tools is fed into another suite of tools, the
Network Workbench (http://nwb.slis.indiana.edu/), to
produce meaningful visualizations that help the user
to comprehend the breadth of the materials and their
interconnections.
Newman has already used the tools to demonstrate
the order of composition of significant parts of
Portsmouth MSS. 3973 and 3975, two of Newton’s
most important notebooks recording his alchemical
experiments performed at Cambridge.
While the tools are being designed primarily for
the analysis of alchemical language in Newton's
alchemical corpus, we of course hope the tools will be
useful in analyzing documents from other disciplines,
and so we are also applying these tools to a significant
corpus of literary documents by Swinburne.
Among Swinburne's works are six volumes of collected
poems, five volumes of collected tragedies, and a
number of volumes of prose literary criticism. The
style, vocabulary and structures of Swinburne's 19thcentury literary works are obviously quite different from
Newton's 17th-century scientific texts. Furthermore,
Swinburne's prose criticism is very distinct—in style,
vocabulary, and structure—from his poetry. An earlier
effort from The Swinburne Project, reported on at last
year's conference, focused on thematic networks in
Swinburne's 1880 volume Songs of the Springtides.
Many instances of networked themes were found by
simple keyword searching. More elusive instances
were identified by traditional methods of close reading,

Digital Humanities 2011

study, and analysis. We are exploring whether our
computational tools are successful at locating some of
these more elusive instances of previously identified
themes and whether the tools can identify clusters that
suggest additional themes and streams of meaning.
Our poster and real-time demonstration of the tools
will present our results thus far with the Newton and
Swinburne projects.

purposes and the two can be welded in combined
operations.
We have created web-based components that
generate comprehensive lists of correlated results
based upon user-selected documents, document
fragments, or word. In the case of document-fragment
queries, the user can select any pair of correlated
fragments and view them side by side. (See Figure 1)

2. Methods and Results
We have found that Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
is very effective for discovering the semantic structure
and organization of Newton’s alchemical corpus. LSA
methods use singular-value decomposition (SVD) to
uncover hidden layers of structure in a body of
information and make it possible to capture and expose
similarities and dissimilarities across an entire corpus
with a single set of operations.
LSA technologies were discussed in the literature in
the early 1990s primarily in the context of information
retrieval. That was a problem because LSA methods
for formulating and executing freeform user queries
over growing datasets are less effective than other
methods based on Bayesian modeling like Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Topic Analysis, and Latent
Profile Analysis, which superseded LSA after 2003.
Many who follow the current literature regard LSA as
an old and limited technology. But the goals of close
study and analysis are often distinct from the goals of
information retrieval, and there is little useful literature
on the use of SVD and LSA for actual text analysis
beyond a report produced by a team at Sandia National
Laboratories in September 2010.
For our purposes, methods like LDA and LPA, which
are based on identifying k-dimensional patterns from
one set of document to the next and strategically
neglecting what is not pertinent to those dimensions,
are less useful for text analysis than methods that
explicitly capture and model all relations between all
words and document chunks in corpora. SVD and LSA
do that very well.

Figure 1: Screen capture of user component showing a sideby-side view of two brief fragments from Portsmouth Add.
MS. 3973, f. 19r, and Add. MS. 3975, f.77r: The yellow color
and red dots indicate shared vocabulary and passages.

Strongly correlated fragments (those correlating at 0.7
and above on a scale ranging between -1.0 and 1.0)
almost always share long phrases and sentences.
The method is robust enough to detect paraphrases
too. One SVD calculation detects and maps all the
passages in that large, arcane corpus which share
vocabulary, phrases, and ideas, saving investigators
considerable time in working through those texts and
revealing correlations that might otherwise escape
notice.
A useful way to present SVD results for interpretation
is to graph them as networks—the document chunks
or the terms are graphed as nodes and the cosine
similarities or correlations between them as edges. Our
tools make network graph files for use in the Network
Workbench (NWB) tool developed by our colleague
Katy Börner’s team at Indiana University. (See Figure
2)

Our research plan includes collocational analysis of the
Newton manuscripts (almost a millions word of English,
Latin, and French), and we are collaborating with IU
computational linguist Sandra Kübler to do part-ofspeech markup, lemmatization, and sentence parsing.
As part of that effort, we have been varying the size of
our LSA document chunks downward from 1000 words
to 250 and 100, approaching the sentence level where
the distinction between “bag-of- words” approaches
and syntax-based methods tends to vanish for practical

sense of the alchemical literature. The algorithms and
graphs make all the connections visible at a glance.
We expect that the combination of LSA-based tools
and network graphs derived from them will provide
invaluable means of problem solving and discovery for
the experienced researcher who is working with large,
complicated corpora.

There has been a great deal of concern recently about
questions of how we should define Digital Humanities.
John Unsworth (2010) in his plenary lecture at DHSI
asked how we might define the boundaries of our
discipline. UCL’s own Melissa Terras, (2010) in her
widely reported plenary at DH2010, warned us that
we must not only understand our discipline ourselves,
but be able to communicate it succinctly to others.
Others, including one of the authors of this proposal,
tend to the view of ‘more hack less yack’. (Meloni,
2010) Yet questions remain, and the theme of DH2011
clearly prompts us toward such considerations. As a
result we present a proposal below for a poster about
the establishment of the new UCL Centre for Digital
Humanities, (UCLDH) (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/) one
of whose founding principles is that of inclusivity,
interdisciplinary and the broadest sense of definition,
in which we demonstrate ways in which the big
tent attitude to digital humanities is put into practice.
Our tent includes not only other disciplines within
academia, but also libraries, museums, archives,
cultural heritage practice and commercial information

providers. In the following proposal we discuss how
this has come about and justify our belief in broadly
defined Digital Humanities (DH).
UCLDH does not think of itself as a DH centre in
the conventional form, where anyone working on DH
must come and work in one central facility. Instead,
it is built on a hypertextual metaphor: it is the hub
of a network, bringing together work being done in
different departments and research centres within
UCL and beyond. This is one of the reasons for our
inclusive philosophy. We do not believe it is for us
to tell people whether they are doing DH, as we
conceive of it. If they would like to become part of
our network, then we welcome their involvement, since
we believe that exciting new research can be created
from synergies in such a network, and by unexpected
collaborations between disciplines. To this end we run
various different networking events such as Digital
Excursions. These visits to different parts of UCL and
other cultural heritage institutions such as the British
Library allow participants to find out about research
and digital facilities they might never previously have
been aware of, and to meet and talk to others whom
they might never have come across. Connections
created by these meetings may take DH forward in
ways we cannot predict, let alone define.
UCL has unique assets as a basis for Digital
Humanities research in the form of Museums and
Collections and Library Special Collections, and digital
art work being produced at the Slade School of Art.
We are also fortunate that our location in central
London means that we are close to many of the
world’s greatest Libraries, Museums and galleries. As
a result one of the main directions in which UCLDH
has sought to extend the definition of what DH might
be is in working with cultural heritage and memory
institutions. For example we are working with the
British Museum, the Museum of London, the Victoria
and Albert Museum on a project that will help us
better to understand the needs and behaviours of
users of digital museum objects. We have doctoral
students undertaking research at various institutions,
including: the British Library, to look at the use of their
mass digitisation projects; The London Metropolitan
Archive, where image processing will be used to
try and decipher the Grand Parchment which is
too damaged and deteriorated to read; The Science
Museum, where the use of 3D scans of museum
objects will be evaluated by the general public; and the
British Museum, where work will be done on curatorial
documentation of 3D scans to investigate standards
and protocols for 3D capture of artefacts.

387

Digital Humanities 2011

UCL has world leading research in both humanities,
computer science and engineering, and we believe
that as a result it is vital to engage all parts of
the university’s research base equally in the DH
endeavour. We aim to create new knowledge both
in computer science and engineering and in the
humanities, as part of the same research projects. We
think of computer scientists as equal research partners
in our work. Computing is not conceived of as existing
to provide a service to facilitate humanities research.
Thus DH research takes place in the Department of
Computer Science as often as in the faculty of Arts
and Humanities. One project led by one of UCLDH’s
associate directors, aims to develop algorithms to
reconstruct the Minoan wall paintings of ancient Thera.
This will lead to advances in computational methods,
but it also aims to redefine the existing conservation
and assembly process, helping archaeologists to
create reconstructions of the frescoes, and to study
them in ways that would previously have been
impossible.
We also believe in engaging with the users of digital
resources, whether they are in academia, cultural
heritage, or the broader interested public. This is the
biggest possible tent that we might pitch for DH.
We are highly engaged with social media in our
own work, as evidenced by the UCLDH blog, and
out Twitter presence (#UCLDH). However, beyond
this, several of our research projects involve social
networking or crowd sourcing, and aim to engage
the public well beyond academia with their heritage.
Transcribe Bentham (http://www.ucl.ac.uk/transcribebentham/) allows users to access digital copies of
Jeremy Betham’s original letters, to learn about the
intricacies of transcribing primary sources, and then to
contribute transcribed text back to the digital collection.
The QRator project will use QR codes to allow museum
visitors to contribute their interpretation of objects to
digital interactive labels using a smart phone app. This
means that crowd sourced understanding of museum
objects can complement the once monolithic curatorial
interpretation of what visitors ought to be seeing.
Stretching the tent even more widely, UCLDH
has also caught the imagination of the wider DH
and cultural heritage community internationally with
its successful discussion group. Decoding Digital
Humanities (DDH) This is an informal discussion group
about DH established and organised by research
students and staff from UCLDH. It meets monthly
and is attended by students, researchers and cultural
heritage practitioners from London and the south of
England as well as those from UCL. It also has five

388

new international chapters: two in Australia, and in the
USA, Belgium and Portugal.
Our definition of the big, interdisciplinary tent also
includes teaching and learning. Our new Masters
(http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dh/courses/mamsc) will be a
highly innovative interdisciplinary programme: the
first in the world to have a dual designation of
MA and MSc, reflecting once again our sense of
the dual balance of our field. Its diverse choice of
options from a wide range of disciplines responds
to the complex nature of DH, including modules
from engineering, computer science, geography,
archaeology, anthropology, architectural studies,
psychology and information studies as well as
pure humanities. It also reflects the needs of the
students, the skills required for a new generation
of scholars as well as those wishing to pursue a
career outside academia. We will also release a
substantial amount of the core materials as open
access digital learning objects as part of the JISC Open
Educational Resources programme: further evidence
of a commitment to openness and broad public
engagement in teaching as well as research.
The guiding principles of our approach to DH are
predicated on welcoming the sense of a field that
is growing and in flux. We do not want to put up
fences, and create definitions of arcane knowledge
which initiates must possess to be part of our exclusive
club. We wish to open wide the doors of this amazingly
diverse discipline to any and all of those who would
like to take part. We believe that DH should create
new knowledge in both parts of the equation, of digital
technologies and humanities scholarship. We believe
that DH should embrace memory institutions and
cultural heritage. We believe that DH should involve
those who use digital resources, allowing them to
contribute their ideas and content to resources, as well
as being consulted about their design. But ultimately,
to be true to our principles, we believe that is it not
our task to define DH at UCLDH. In the spirit of social
media, we propose that the definition of the field should
be allowed to develop organically, taking into account
the views and input of those who participate in it, within
and beyond the academy. Our view of DH is crowd
sourced, inclusive and ever growing: big tent Digital

Over the last several decades, scholars have
developed standards for how best to create, organize,
present, and preserve digital information so that
future generations of teachers, students, scholars,
and librarians may still use it. What has remained
neglected for the most part, however, are the needs
of disabled end-users, especially those whose vision
is impaired. While professionals working in educational
technology and commercial web design have made
significant progress in meeting the needs of such
users, the humanities scholars creating digital projects
all too often fail to take these needs into account.
This situation would be much improved if more of
projects embraced the concept of universal design, the
idea that we should always keep the largest possible
audience in mind in our design decisions, ensuring
that our final product serves the needs of those with
disabilities as well as those without.
We are proposing a poster session to demonstrate
our work in progress on BrailleSC.org, an online
scholarly resource dedicated to braille and braille
literacy in South Carolina. The earliest stages of
development were funded by a grant from the U.S.
Department of Special Education, and the site is
currently supported by a Level 1 Start-Up Grant from
the National Endowment for the Humanities Office of
Digital Humanities. The content is managed with both
WordPress and Omeka, and for each of these CMSes
we are developing accessibility plugins designed to
meet the needs of visually impaired users. Our hope
is that these plugins become widely adopted by
other digital humanities projects that use these same
CMSes. During our session we would demonstrate our
site, argue for the importance of accessibility, and allow
audience members to experience our site in the ways a
visually impaired end-user would. We will also discuss
389

Digital Humanities 2011

the work we are undertaking—at the moment, very
preliminary—to develop a tool that would automatically
transform an alphabetic text file (encoded in HTML
or TEI standards) into a well-formatted contracted
braille file. We’re currently looking into whether or not
the WordPress plugin Anthologize might be a useful
starting point for developing such a capability.
BrailleSC seeks to combine digital humanities
expertise with the important insights of disability
studies in the humanities, an interdisciplinary field
that considers disability “a way of interpreting human
differences,” in the words of one prominent scholar.
Digital knowledge tools that assume all end-users
approach information with the same abilities risk
excluding a large population of people. If the digital
humanities is to accomplish the admirable goal of
creating a “big tent,” welcoming a diverse array of
participants, then we must broaden our understanding
of the ways in which these participants access digital
resources. For example, visually-impaired users take
advantage of digital technologies for “accessibility”
that (with their oral/aural and tactile interfaces) are
fascinatingly different than the standard monitorkeyboard-mouse combination, forcing us to rethink
our embodied relationship to data. Learning to create
scholarly digital archives that take into account these
human differences is a necessary task no one has yet
undertaken.
In partnership with the Center for Digital Humanities
in Columbia, South Carolina, and with guidance from
George Mason University’s Center for History and
New Media, BrailleSC aims to model the ways in
which digital humanities projects can be designed and
implemented with the needs of all users, regardless of
disability. Users with visual impairment often access
digital information through a variety of alternatives, not
primarily using traditional visual cues presented from
the standard graphical user interface. For example,
many such users navigate information by listening to
a synthesized voice reading textual material aloud to
them. The software that generates such a voice is
known as a “screen reader.” To make navigation easier
for these users, our “Access Keys” plug-in for Omeka
allows users to get from page to page and section to
section by pressing an easy-to-remember combination
of keys. Other users require text enlargement , and our
Omeka “Text Zoom” plug-in changes the size of the
text to suit their needs. Future work will refine these
existing plug-ins and develop additional ones for users
to customize such elements as color and contrast.
As development of the site content and interface
continues, we are conducting various user-testing
sessions involving a diverse group of people with
390

varying degrees of visual ability or impairment. All
interface tools developed for the BrailleSC project
have been or will be released as open source
code. All content is being made available under a
Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share
Alike license. Easy-to-follow instructions for how to
implement the accessibility features are currently being
created. The Center for Digital Humanities has agreed
to provide long-term hosting for all tools and content
developed. Finally, a white paper will be released at
the project’s conclusion explaining what collaborators
have learned about developing designing accessible
digital humanities projects and making suggestions for
“retrofitting” existing projects.

This paper investigates epistemic modality in Edgar
Allan Poe’s Gothic stories and their translations into
Slovenian and Finnish. To facilitate this we have built a
tool that allows the researcher to align the translations,
search for the instances of epistemic stance and
compare the original text with the translations. From
the point of view of translation studies, epistemic
modality is interesting in the context of Gothic stories,
because it helps to create the mood of the story and
any major shifts in the translation may cause a loss of
the essence of the Gothic. On the other hand, the tool
we have built is applicable to any investigation into a
text and its translations and will, we hope, significantly
aid those working in the field.
Epistemic modality has traditionally been regarded as
the “manner in which the meaning of a clause is
qualified so as to reflect the speaker’s judgement of
the likelihood of the proposition it expresses being
true” (Quirk et. al. 1992: 219). In other words, it shows
the position that speakers adopt with respect to the
truth value of what they are saying (hence it is also
referred to as epistemic stance). As Halliday (Halliday
and Matthiesen 2004) has pointed out, speakers can
adopt two extreme positions; they either qualify their
proposition as true (e.g. “Translation scholars are
in need of efficient electronic text-analysis tools.”)
or, alternatively, as not true (“Translation scholars
are not in need of efficient electronic text-analysis
tools.”). These two positions are referred to as positive
and negative polarity, respectively. More importantly,
speakers can also adopt various positions in between
the two poles. They can thus claim something to
be “more” true (“Translation scholars are definitely in

need of efficient text-analysis tools.”) or “less” true
(“Translation scholars are probably not in need of
efficient text-analysis tools.”). It is precisely these
intermediate positions that are strictly referred to
as epistemic modality because they indicate the
speaker’s (apparent) inability to ascertain the truth
of the proposition they are making and consequently
qualify it as polar.
This has important implications for the Gothic
stories, in particular from the point of view of their
translation into other languages. As Simpson (2004)
has pointed out, authors of Gothic stories often
employ epistemic modality to add uncertainty to them.
These narratives thus abound in expressions such
as “possibly”, “perhaps”, “undoubtedly”, “it might have
been”, “I believe” and the like, which all indicate the
protagonists’ (apparent) inability to be able to tell what
was behind a particular event or experience. In turn,
this makes that same event or experience appear
mysterious. It also lays ground for evoking in the
reader the prototypical Gothic effects such as that of
discomfort, uncanniness or eeriness. Consequently,
these linguistic features of the original text need to
be preserved in the translation. As our preliminary
research has shown, however, this is not always the
case. Comparison of one of the Slovenian translations
with the original has shown that the translator failed to
preserve epistemic modality in some of the examples
by turning them into polar sentences. As a result,
those passages in the target text lost some of their
potential to evoke the same Gothic effects as their
corresponding passages in the original.
In order to further investigate the extent of this
phenomenon, we analyse several of Edgar Allan
Poe’s stories. These include The Fall of the House
of Usher, Berenice, The Masque of the Red Death,
Metzengerstein, and Ligeia, all of which can be seen
as Gothic stories or stories with Gothic elements.
To facilitate the comparison of the source text and
the target text(s), we have built ParallelTexts, a tool
that allows the researcher to view two or three texts
simultaneously in a synchronized manner. It makes
use of XML markup, using pages and paragraphs,
or other user-defined elements, for the purposes of
synchronization of texts. There is support for marking
up additions, deletions and other shifts in the text. The
user interface shows a table-like view of the texts and
allows for simultaneous scrolling of the texts. Figure 1
below shows the basic principle of the use interface,
where the text in red on the left-hand side is highlighted
to indicate that it is not found in the text on the righthand side, ie the comparison version or the target
text. Equally, the text in green on the right-hand side
391

Digital Humanities 2011

indicates that this text has been added into the target
text and has no equivalent in the original text.

Fig. 1 A first version of ParallelTexts,
with some basic instructions for using it

With appropriate input data, ParallelTexts allows us to
examine various aspects of both the original text and its
translation(s). First, it helps us identify most instances
of epistemic modality in the original text and allows
easy access to their corresponding sentences in the
translation(s). Second, the tool allows us to statistically
examine the texts and determine various quantitative
features, among them the number of occurrences of
epistemic modality and their distribution in both the
original and the translation. Finally, the quantitative
data collected with ParallelTexts will also allow us to
qualitatively examine individual instances of epistemic
modality in both texts and determine the cumulative
effect of epistemic modality translation shifts on the
translation as a whole. We also expect that the tool
will prove to be useful for other similar translation
studies text analyses. We believe that with some
modification and appropriate input data, ParallelTexts
could be used to compare any type of linguistic
features in the original text and its translation. We wish
to demonstrate the tool at DH2011 and all feedback
and suggestions for further improvement of the tool will
be most welcome.
