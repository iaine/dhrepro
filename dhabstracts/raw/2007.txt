Introduction
Welcome to The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign—the birthplace of
ILLIAC (the first computer built and owned entirely by an educational institution),
PLATO (the first online instructional program and home of the first online
community), The Illiac Suite (the first piece of music produced with a computer),
Project Gutenberg (the first online collection of literary texts), Mosaic (the first
graphical web browser), and Richard Powers (author of Galatea 2.2 and The Gold
Bug Variations). UIUC is also home to the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications where computer engineers and domain experts pursue grid computing,
security, visualization, datamining, scientific computing, and petascale computing.
NCSA is a sponsor of this conference, along with CHASS, the new and
NCSA-based Center for Computing in Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. The
other sponsor, and home to the local organizer, is the Graduate School of Library
and Information Science, or GSLIS. GSLIS (pronounced "gislis") has the oldest
doctoral program of its kind in the U.S., and it offers a professional masters program
that is ranked in first place nationally, as well as an advanced graduate degree for
practitioners in digital libraries and an undergraduate minor in information
technology studies. GSLIS has been delivering online degree programs since 1996,
and it currently enrolls half of its students in the online program. The GSLIS faculty
includes some well-known names in humanities computing, including Allen Renear,
past president of The Association for Computers and the Humanities.
Many people contributed to the materials that are represented in this book of
abstracts. As local organizer, I would like to begin by thanking two people whose
diligence and effort made this conference possible: Ray Siemens, who chaired the
international program committee with great aplomb and efficiency, all the while
making it look easy, and Sara Schmidt, who assisted in every aspect of the local
process, from registration to submissions for review, to exhorting authors to turn
in final copy of accepted abstracts, to marking up the abstracts into their final form
for this book and their presentation on the Web. Sara has thrown herself into
organizing this conference with a will, and she has found a way to make everything
work.
So many others need to be thanked, beginning with the authors who submitted
proposals to the conference in the first place, and to all of those who contributed
their time and expertise to reviewing submissions to the conference: the quality of
what we present at this year's conference is due to both kinds of effort. Thanks
also go to the International Program Committee, who—under Ray's able
leadership—vetted the outcome of the reviewing process and made the difficult
final decisions on the program. I'd also like to thank Harald Weinrich, of Hamburg,
Germany, developer of the ConfTool system that we used this year to manage the
reviewing and registration processes: he was very helpful when we needed changes
to that system, and I recommend him and ConfTool highly.

Thanks also must go to Martin Holmes, for helping us to re-use the
XML/XSL-based abstract publishing system developed for the 2005 iteration of
this conference, in Victoria, British Columbia, and Amit Kumar for getting that
system set up under digitalhumanities.org, where it can be re-used in future years,
and for tweaking the stylesheets and other aspects of that system for this year's
conference. David Dubin and Kevin S. Hawkins helped with translation issues,
from German and Russian, respectively, and Christian Wittern, Elisabeth Burr,
Peter Liddel, Alex Bia, and others helped in extending and adapting translations
in the ConfTool interface; Syd Bauman and Julia Flanders helped to answer
questions about TEI encoding of the abstracts; and Hana S. Field assisted Sara in
marking up those abstracts. Melissa Terras helped in rounding up information
about current membership/subscribership, from Oxford University Press, and
Miranda Remnek helped with bursaries for our Eastern European colleagues.
Several of those were very generously paid for by Vernon Burton, out of the
resources of the Center for Computing in the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences
here at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Some were also covered by
the Associations (ACH and ALLC): this is one of the many worthwhile things that
the Associations do with the income that individual subscribers provide.
I hope you enjoy your visit to Champaign-Urbana, and I hope you have a chance
to take the excursions to Springfield (the Lincoln Museum and the Dana Thomas
House, a Frank Lloyd Wright commission) and Allerton Park (recently declared
one of the 'seven wonders of Illinois'). In between, I hope you have a stimulating
and successful conference, hear many fine papers, and engage in those hallway
conversations that are sometimes the most rewarding part of a small conference.

About this abstract collection
Planning for Digital Humanities 2007 began in earnest in the Sorbonne’s Maison
de la Recherche, in July 2006, at the first conjoint conference of the Association
for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) and the Association for Literary and
Linguistic Computing (ALLC) under the umbrella of the Association for Digital
Humanities Organisations (ADHO) – a meeting most certainly inspired by the
collegiality, congeniality, and grace of our hosts, Liliane Gallet-Blanchard and
Marie-Madeleine Martinet of CATI, the research centre for Cultures Anglophones
et Technologies de l'Information. With the success of our time together in Paris as
exemplar—the Parisian gathering itself modeled on successes of the past at Victoria,
Göteborg, Athens, Tübingen, New York, Glasgow, Charlottesville, Debrecen,
Kingston, Bergen, Santa Barbara, Washington, Tempe, Toronto, among many
other notable loci for our community—near the end of a conference that we roundly
acknowledged as being a high water mark for our community, we had good reason
to anticipate with considerable optimism our next community event: the 2007
meeting in the ‘Paris of the midwest’, at the University of Illinois
Urbana-Champaign.
As this brief rehearsing of important gathering places, people key to our recent
events, and the research centres kindly sponsoring our conference activity rightly
begins to suggest, no conference organizing group works in isolation, nor without
a helpful context. Indeed, in a community like ours, conference organization can
be as much a pleasure as conference participation, for each is an activity involving
the interaction of members of the community—from the conception of the annual
conference theme (which often arises out of key points of focus from earlier
conferences), to the breaking-in of a new conference management tool for our
community (which involved absolutely everyone), to receiving and reviewing
presentation proposals (involving a group numbering circa one hundred), to the
conference itself (which has an impact beyond the conference attendees, eventually
on thousands of interested individuals).
While we all participate, some notes of special thanks are due to our local hosts
and sponsors, represented most generously in the person of John Unsworth, and
to those involved in the conference assistance from which we all benefit, personified
with utmost efficiency by this volume’s co-editor, Sara Schmidt. A note of especial
gratitude is due to all those who so diligently participated in the review of
submissions for the conference: Adrian Miles, Allen H. Renear, Amy Bruckman,
Anna Bentkowska-Kafel, Bethany Nowviskie, Bruce Robertson, Christian Kay,

System to Support Online
Volunteer Translators

1. Introduction

W

e are currently developing an English-to-Japanese
computer-aided translation (CAT) system with the aim
of aiding online volunteer translators, who are involved in
translating online electronic documents in their free time. In
the following, we will first describe the characteristics of target
users, and discuss the basic concept of the system within which
the choice of functions and system specifications has been
made. Then we will describe the prototype CAT system which
we are now experimentally providing to a limited number of
online translators.

2. Background and basic concepts

M

any CAT systems have been developed to date [see
Kay 1997 for background information and Gow 2003
for a comparison of several CAT systems]. While some existing
CAT systems have proved useful for some translators and
translation companies, volunteer translators who work online
do not use these systems [Kageura, et. al. 2006; see also Fulford
and Granell Zafra 2004 in relation to the situation of freelance
translators in Britain], for a variety of reasons: they are too
expensive for personal use (except for Omega-T, which is free
[Omega-T 2007]); they have more functions than are necessary;
such translators are not under pressure from managers to keep
a translation log in order to control quality, etc. This shows that
some sort of CAT-lite system is required by online translators,
which shares some basic functionalities with existing
commercial CAT systems but with a different emphasis and
overall design principle [Boitet, et. al. 2005].

translators have never used. Thus we are taking a bottom-up
approach in developing system functions, reflecting the concrete
requirements of translators. Another essential principle we have
adopted is that it should be translators who make decisions, not
the system.
After consulting some 15 volunteer translators working online,
we identified the following issues as being particularly
important:
1. Most English-to-Japanese volunteer translators do not have
native level command in the source language (English). As
a result, unlike such CAT systems as TransType
[Macklovitch 2006] which assume that the target users are
bilingual, well-trained and professional translators, and
therefore try to reduce the time used for inputting the target
language text, the main point to be tackled in our
environment is making the reference lookup process as easy
as possible.
2. When selecting translation expressions, translators examine
various possibilities. When necessary, they look up more
than one dictionary and check other information resources
such as print encyclopaedias or Wikipedia, etc. The CAT
system should facilitate the translation process by reducing
the effort involved in looking up multiple resources. As it
is not the mission of the system to decide on behalf of
translators, good output for the system is considered to be
a range of candidates and information that translators can
take into account in making decisions, and not simply the
same expression as translators chose.
3. Some online translators do not use online dictionaries,
because doing so breaks the rhythm of translation and
hinders the construction of the target text. Partly because
of this, some prefer using print or standalone electronic
dictionaries. A few use dictionaries built into the text editor,
but none of them are fully satisfied with the dictionary
look-up environment.
4. There is a pressing need for improved idiom and phrasal
look-up. The importance of this function derives from two
factors: (a) many translators, even experienced ones, have
relatively less knowledge of idioms than of words, and (b)
some idioms may not be identified as such by translators,
because they make sense without an idiomatic interpretation.
This leads to translation mistakes.
5. As our system does not aim to choose and restrict
information on behalf of translators by using "sophisticated"
NLP techniques, the amount of information it provides will
naturally tend to increase. As a result, the user-interface
becomes an important issue.

We have therefore been engaged in developing a CAT system
for online volunteer translators, based on the principle of
maximally aiding the translators' work flow by removing
existing obstacles, rather than providing extra functions which

3. The prototype system QRedit

B

ased on these concepts and requirements, we are currently
developing a prototype system that supports online
translators. The system runs on the TOMCAT server and users
access the system through a Web browser. The overall image
of QRedit is shown in the figure. The browser screen is divided
into two areas: (i) the source text area, and (ii) the target text
area. The users can choose between horizontal and
perpendicular division of the areas, i.e. source text area on the
bottom and target language area on the top, or source text area
on the left and target language area on the right. The two areas
are linked with a synchronised scroll function.

3.2 The connection between the source text area
and the target text area
Translators can paste a selected expression from the list of
candidates in the pop-up area to the target text area by clicking
the mouse. The system also provides automatic transformation
of numerical expressions to Japanese conventions and the
pasting of HTML tags. This mouse operation does not affect
the keyboard operation, and whatever the user does with the
mouse, the keyboard cursor always stays on the target text
editing area, so that the user can input translated text
continuously.

3.3 Target text area
3.1 Functions in the source text area
After a translator inputs the URL of a Web page (in which case
the system analyses the tags and extracts the textual area
automatically) or copies and pastes text into the source text
area, the system activates the dictionary look-up functions.
When the user clicks on a particular word in the source text
area with the mouse, the system shows the translation candidates
in a pop-up window.

Dictionary look-up functions
The system displays translation candidates from the dictionaries
incorporated into the system [Sanseido 2004; Eijiro 2006]. The
system does not only incorporates simple word look-up
functions but also incorporates flexible idiom look-up functions.
The idiom look-up functions can match such idiom occurrences
as "He said that with his big fat tongue in his big fat cheek"
with the dictionary entry "with one's tongue in one's cheek."
This function has not been realised in any English-Japanese
MT systems we have checked, and while some CAT systems
realise similar functions through approximate matching, they
do not specifically target the look-up of idioms with their
variations. The system alerts users to idioms by marking them
with an underline.

Displaying translation candidates
The system can display information in two ways. One is a small
pop-up window displayed within the source text area, which
includes only target word candidates. The other is a large pop-up
window that displays all the information given under the
headings in the dictionaries. The latter is particularly useful
when translators wish to examine related information in detail
before deciding on a translation, while the former is convenient
for more straightforward dictionary look-up.

The target text area consists of the open source Web editor
FCKeditor, which offers WYSIWYG textual decoration and
editing, as well as saving and loading functions. The text can
be saved in HTML as well as in basic textual format. The target
area is split into paragraph spaces which correspond to the
source text.

4. Conclusions

W

e are currently running a prototype system of QRedit
that incorporates these functions, and accumulating
feedback from a few online volunteer translators. The feedback
that we have obtained so far can be categorised into two types:
1. The need to refine existing functions and improve basic
usability, e.g., to improve the accuracy of the extraction of
the textual area when the user specifies an URL for the
source text area.
2. The need to incorporate higher-level functions, e.g. to allow
the user to specify the register of the text that (s)he is
translating, in order to have the system block irrelevant
dictionary information from being displayed.
3. In addition, we are developing a module that automatically
compiles bilingual technical terminologies from the Web,
a module that detects existing translation pairs and recycles
the translation information, and a system that detects
candidates for transliterated expressions of proper names
from the Web, all of which will be integrated into the
QRedit environment.

Abstract

T

his paper proposes to use citation networks as a tool for
mapping out links among disciplines and research areas
in & around humanities. By collecting papers from main
journals in diverse areas like cognitive science, art history and
psychoanalysis, this study aims to build a small citation network
that will be visualized and published as a 3d web page. The
end-map will be the backbone of a dissertation, which tries to
analyze the influence of various movements and disciplines
onto the art historical canon. Used as such, a citation network
can become more than a frozen map that has more than a
one-time use value.

A

ccess to online electronic databases and tools such as
Google scholar have led to a significant improvement in
the discovery of secondary literature. However, organizing the
vast amount of bibliographic information from various
discipline-specific databases continues to be an impediment to
truly interdisciplinary work. My project attempts to construct
virtual maps of electronic databases or digital libraries capable
of providing scholars with significant links between disciplinary
relations, interdisciplinary research areas, or tendencies,
approaches and methodologies inside a single discipline.
Moreover, as I will show, if the third dimension, namely history,
is added to these maps, the transformation of the disciplines,
the merging of research areas, and the changes in the taxonomic
structure of the academy will be revealed to the expert eye. As
an example of how such a virtual time-map could become a
valuable analytic tool during the research process, I will
construct such a tool and, using my dissertation as a test case,
demonstrate how it can be applied to map intersections between
art historiography, psychoanalysis and cognitive science.
As a PhD candidate in UCLA's Art History program, my
dissertation traces the changes of the critical discourse from
Page 5

Digital Humanities 2007
the 1970s, when the so-called "New Art History" clashed with
traditional art historians, and gave rise to a whole new
approach—one that has now become known as Visual Cultural
Studies. However, in such a broad context, one needs to handle
a deluge of texts and interrelations. A simple timeline, a linear
outline constituted of chapters and subchapters is not enough
to depict the map of overlapping layers, concepts and relations
between opposite but—in this case still—allied methodologies.
In order to render all these visible, I would like to create a
multidimensional space of such relations. To that end I propose
to collect significant papers, extract citation information using
various text-analysis programs and visualize the end results as
a citation network that runs along three different trajectories,
namely the history of psychoanalytical and cognitive scientific
methodologies and their impact on the evolution of New Art
History into Visual Cultural Studies.

History:

A

relatively new research venue, called ‘scientometrics’ or
‘bibliometrics’, specializes in creating such maps for
delineating growth, relations and interactions in scientific
fields.1 Bibliometrics uses text analysis to extract citation data
from papers and makes use of this data as a way of evaluating
scientific publications. To obtain information from scientific
papers and using he results in mapping out scientific relations
has a long history. As early as 1964 Garfield and his colleagues
suggested using citation data to evaluate the development of
science.2 From 80’s on, the research in this area accelerated
with the advancement of computers and various combinations
of statistical methods used to extract and evaluate information
such as citations, co- citations with reference of various
bibliometric data. The end-results are usually rendered as
so-called ‘citation networks’ which are a variation of social
networks.3 Now it is a common practice to evaluate a scholar
or a journal according to how many times it/he/she is cited.
Moreover, there is so much research done using citation
networks as a methodology to analyze the disciplines, many
scholars are now questioning the efficacy of this approach.4
Among the ample publications in this area, two general
approaches distinguish themselves: the citation networks are
either built to support an idea or to enhance the way in which
such networks are composed. In the first instance, a search is
done to filter out unnecessary papers. The maps generated in
this way are limited with a scope, and generally give an
overview of the research topic. These maps are not created from
a relational database and are not published for further use. That
means they are not applicable to other research questions and
the enormous work put into collecting papers and preparing
them for network analysis is done on a case-by-case basis
because access to the databases is restricted and therefore the
datasets themselves cannot be made available. In the second
Page 6

instance papers are extracted from the electronic database
without any filtering. Instead a time limit is imposed. These
types of publications tend to focus more on the technical details
and explore the mathematical substructure of social networks.
Usually open-source databases are preferred, since the main
idea is to test the application’s performance on huge datasets.
Papers about such studies do not interpret the resulting map
and instead detail the mathematical innovation of the
applications.
Despite the popularity of this approach in the sciences, I have
yet to find a paper that uses Humanities databases. Even the
most comprehensive citation network, a data set that
encompasses "7,121 journals covering over 1 million documents
in the combined Science Citation and Social Science Citation
Indexes” does not delve into the Arts and Humanities Citation
Index.5 Rather than simply applying the same techniques to
Humanities materials, a fresh approach, one that is not only
suits to humanities scholarship, but addresses some of the issues
raised in the scientific communities seems desirable.6 Although
my long-term goal is to create a dynamic citation network that
can become a part of an ongoing research project in digital
humanities, in this paper I will focus on creating a static citation
network using open-source tools. My research plan to achieve
this aim is as follows:
1. Collecting papers: I have already collected around 2000
papers, mostly from prominent journals in Art History (such
as Art Bulletin, October, Art Journal and Leonardo), and
in Cognitive Science (Trends in Cognitive Sciences). Beside
these resources I would like to include the classical texts in
psychoanalysis; which can be found in electronic format in
the Psychoanalytic Electronic Publishing database. The
main criterion used for selecting pertinent papers is to use
keywords that are relevant for the research topic. For
example I used keywords such as "Freud", "psychoanalysis",
"aesthetic", "artist" while searching in a cognitive science
journal whereas I chose keywords like ‘cognition",
"cognitive science", "vision", "artist" etc. for the search in
the domain of psychoanalysis.
2. Preprocessing the database for text analysis & extraction
the needed information: The acquired corpus is preprocessed
for text mining and analysis. Preparing a list of keywords
and bibliometric data (author name, date, journal name,
title, etc.) will be enough for the preprocessing stage. We
will experiment with different text- mining and text analysis
programs and report on those that work well at this stage
of data preparation.
3. Construction of social networks: A social network is a graph
representation of social relations. Graphs are the most
popular and widely researched data structure for
representing and processing relational data. In a graph, each
node represents one entity (a person in a social network; a
researcher or a work in a citation network) and the edges

Digital Humanities 2007
(or arcs, if they are directed) of the graph represent some
relation. One can also indicate the strength of the relation
by associating weights with the edges of the graph. Then,
by using tools like Pajek7, the graph nodes can be placed
in a 3D space in such a way to minimize an energy term.
Thus, the nodes that are close to each other semantically
(through the interpretation of graph edges) are placed in
proximity, even when they don't have actual links. On a
social network, clusters and cliques can be identified,
indirect relations can be uncovered, and relevance judgments
can be made based on quantitative or qualitative measures.
Even the location of the nodes (center vs. periphery) can
be informative for a person thoroughly acquainted with the
represented structure.
The use of such a graph tool is simple; nodes and arcs are read
from a file, and the graph visualization is accomplished with a
few commands. For a citation or semantic network, text mining
tools can be employed to derive the entities in relation
automatically. Once such a network is built, Pajek can import
the graph in 3D file formats like 3xd and VRML; both are now
becoming standards for internet publication in 3D.8

6. Even though the end results of the “citation networks” give a
scholar a good overview, they are still not integrated into the
academic research facilities like Web of Science, Science Citation
Index, Social Citation Index or Arts & Humanities Citation Index
etc. The main reason is that once a citation network is derived, it
becomes a static entity; it covers a limited time and scope. Thus
citation networks, by their very definitions and aims, fail to keep
up with new publications.

Conclusion

T

he proposed tool serves not only as a bibliographic aid,
but will become the main framework for my dissertation.
By incorporating the 3D virtual map into my dissertation, I
hope to demonstrate a new form of digital scholarship--one that
springs from the new possibilities that digital technologies
affords scholars in the humanities whose work is inherently,
and exuberantly, interdisciplinary.

The Black Stage has been an important focus of evolving Black
identity and self-representation, touching on many of the most
contentious
issues
in
American
history
since
Emancipation—such as migration, exploitation, interracial
unity, racial violence, and civil rights activism (Hill 2003).
Alexander Street Press (ASP), in collaboration with the ARTFL
Project, has developed an extensively tagged database of over
1,200 plays containing 13.3 million words by Black playwrights,
from the middle of the 19th century to the present, including
many previously unpublished works. Like other ASP datasets,
the Black Drama database is remarkable for its detailed
encoding and amount of metadata associated with authors, titles,
acts/scenes, performances, and characters. Of particular interest
for this study are the data available for authors and characters
which are stored as "stand-off mark-up" data tables. The
character table, for example, contains some 13,360 records with
some 30 fields including name(s), race, age, gender, nationality,
ethnicity, occupation, sexual orientation, performers, if a real
person, and type. More extensive information is available for
authors and titles. The character data are joined to each character
speech, giving 562,000 objects that can be queried by the full
range of character attributes. The ARTFL search system,
PhiloLogic, allows for joining of object attribute searches,
forming a matrix of author/title/character searching. For
example, one can search for words in speeches by female, black,
Page 8

American characters depicted by male, non-American authors
in comedies first published during the first half of the 20th
century.
While user-initiated full-text searches on such author and
character attributes can help answer specific questions, we
believe that advanced text data mining systems have the
potential to reveal important new patterns of variation in general
language use, broken down by various combinations of author
and character attributes. Initial work on racial epithets in this
collection has revealed striking differences in the use of such
language between male and female authors and characters, as
well as American and non-American authors. While illustrative,
such micro-studies can do no more than hint at larger discursive
and representation issues that we believe can be identified by
text mining techniques. Prior studies using text mining for
analyzing variation in language use among different classes of
authors have succeeded in identifying meaningful linguistic
features distinguishing author gender, age, and personality type
(e.g. Argamon et al. 2003, Koppel et al. 2002).
As might be expected of a collection of a particular class of
literary texts, the Black Drama database cannot be considered
a "random" sample. The database contains 963 works by 128
male playwrights and 243 pieces by 53 female playwrights.
Plays by Americans dominate the collection (831 titles), with
the remaining 375 titles representing the works of African and
Caribbean authors. The database contains 317,000 speeches by
8,392 male characters and 192,000 speeches by 4,162 female
characters. There are 336,000 speeches by 7,067 black
characters and 55,000 by 1,834 white characters with a
smattering of speeches by other racial groups. As would be
expected, the predominance of American authors is reflected
in the nationalities of speakers in the plays, with 272,000
speeches, compared with 71,000 by speakers represented as
coming from a variety of African nations.
Using these data, we are examining the degree to which machine
learning can isolate stylistic or content characteristics of authors
and/or characters having particular attributes—gender, race,
and nationality—and the degree to which pairs of
author/character attributes interact. The first step to discover if
lexical style- or content-markers can be found which can be
used to reliably distinguish plays or speeches broken down by
a particular characteristic, such as gender of character. A
positive result would constitute strong evidence for distinctive,
in this case, male and female, character voices in the sample
of plays. If distinctiveness can be shown, we then seek some
'characterization' of the differences found, in terms of
well-defined grammatical or semantic classes. The experimental
protocol which we have been developing for this purpose, as
applied by, e.g., Argamon et al. (2003), addresses both goals
using techniques from machine learning, supplemented by more
traditional computer-assisted text analysis.

Digital Humanities 2007
First, to analyze a corpus of texts for distinctiveness, we need
to determine if effective predictive models can be learned from
the texts, which accurately classify new texts (that the system
has not seen). The standard technique of 10-fold cross-validation
can be used to estimate the usefulness of a learning method for
constructing models that work for 'out-of-sample' data. The
corpus is divided into 10 random subsets, and training is
repeated for each of the 10 sets of 9 of those subsets, with
accuracy of the resulting model is measures on the remaining
subset. The average of these 10 numbers then forms a
reasonably good estimate of how a model learned on the entire
corpus would perform for new data. If this cross-validation
accuracy is high (at least 70% for 50-50 balanced data), we
may conclude that the two classes of texts in the corpus are
linguistically 'distinctive'.
Second, to characterize the difference found (if any), all textual
features extracted (frequencies of lexemes, lemmas,
parts-of-speech, etc.) are ranked by some measure of how each
of them enables prediction of a text's correct class. One such
measure is to use feature weights computed during learning
(for SVM or Naive Bayes learners, which compute such
weights). Features with high weights (positive or negative) are
the most influential in classifying a text as one class or the other
(dependent on the sign of the weight). While a direct measure
of influence, these weights can be difficult to interpret since
the effect of a feature must be considered in the context of all
the other features influencing classification. Another approach
is to use a function that measures the 'distinguishability' of a
feature without regard to other features, such as information
gain or binormal separation (Forman et al. 2003). The downside
here is that some features may be of little use alone, but in
conjunction with others may have great discriminating power.
In the current study we will be examining the usefulness of
multiple measures of both types, and see which approach proves
to be the more useful.
We conducted preliminary tests using the SVM-Light system
(Joachims 1999) with PGPDT (Zanghirati 2004, Zanni 2006)
to build the models. We extracted all speeches with character
gender attributes from the corpus, splitting them into tokenized
word frequency vectors for all authors, all characters, male
authors, female authors, male characters, and female characters.
For each of these, PGPDT built a model to identify authors and
characters by gender.

Table One

As indicated in Table One, the system the system correctly
identified 88.2% of the authors' gender and 77.4% of the
speakers' gender. Performance varied when examining subsets

of the corpus, from 86.6% for gender of author in male
characters to 69.7% for gender of speaker in female authors.
All of these indicators show significant differences in words
used by male and female authors and speakers. The differences
in accuracy in male and female author/character may, however,
result from the fact that male authors tend to include fewer
female characters and that the have fewer words as well as
having fewer female authors in the sample. This is shown in
the Majority row of Table One, which indicates the rate of male
instances for each assessment. For female authors, male
characters constitute 54.5% of the speakers.
We then equalized a test sample for class by discarding
instances until we have a balanced set with an attempt to correct
for word frequencies as well. As shown in Table Two, author
and character gender can be discriminated well. Furthermore,
we see that identification of author gender is consistently more
accurate than gender of speaker.

Table Two

As shown in Table 3, male authors/speakers are correctly
somewhat more often in five of the six cases, with the sole
exception of almost exactly the same correct identification of
speaker gender in female authors.

Table Three

These results suggest that female lexical choices, both used by
authors and depicted in characters, are somewhat less marked
(or more varied) than male use of language. The full paper will
explore this phenomenon in greater detail. While the accuracy
of identification of gender in significant in all the cases we
example, we expect that using some sort of feature set selection,
as in, for example, Hota, Argamon, and Chung (2006), will
improve the precision of the identification.
From this preliminary analysis, it would appear that the
authorial gender is rather more readily identified than the
represented gender in characters. Initial examination of the
features that best predict gender of character, as identified by
information gain, range from the expected (male characters
speak of wives and swear more frequently), to the somewhat
Page 9

Digital Humanities 2007
opaque, such as the words 'nonsense' and 'reason' being strongly
male associated. It is also important to note that both strongly
male and female character terms in this sample are used at about
the same rates (per 10000 words) by male and female authors.
This suggests that male and female authors are able to use
certain linguistic gender markers effectively. As noted, it is
significant that the machine learning algorithms employed are
less accurate in most cases in identifying female as opposed to
male authors and speakers.
The final paper will report results using similar techniques to
examine the the degree to which additional character attributes
-- race and nationality -- can be distinguished and, if this proves
to be effective, examine the most important features
distinguishing between the language of white and black speakers
and American/non-American speakers. An initial examination
of racial slurs in this dataset suggests that speaker race and
nationality may also be readily identified.
As we have seen, machine learning and text mining techniques
can support higher orders of generalization and characterization
than the more traditional user-driven search methods widely
used in computer-aided textual research. This approach is most
effective when used in relatively constrained experiments where
classification criteria are clearly defined, such as the social
attributes of authors and their characters. Some results may be
trivial on a literary level— of course men talk more of wives
and only women tend to call other women hussies —but such
common sense results allow us to argue that the technique gives
meaningful results, and so odd results should be examined
further, using more traditional systems like PhiloLogic. We
therefore argue that approaching the interpretative process
starting with highly structured and constrained experimental
hypotheses, we can take advantage of machine learning methods
to find new and unexpected foci for examining literary
questions, which may in turn shed new light on critical issues
such as race and gender.

t is well documented that men and women use informal
language, such as conversation and correspondence, in
rather different ways, reflecting a wide variety of cultural forces
and practices (Tannen 1990, Eckert & McConnell-Ginet 2003).
Recent work has suggested that gender differences may also
be found in more formal, written communications. Koppel,
Argamon, et al (2002) have shown that gender of author can
be accurately predicted between 70 and 80 percent of cases of
published samples from the British National Corpus, using
machine learning and text mining techniques. Using simple
statistical and collocation techniques, Olsen (2005) has argued
that there are distinct gender differences in literary French from
the 17th to the early 20th centuries. He (Olsen: 2004) further
proposed that the differences between male and female writing
during this time does not appear to support a "two cultures"
model (Liberman 2004), but that it was a more conscious
political activity of domain specific writing in which men and
women deployed the same language.
We are addressing several issues that arise from our previous
work on gender and public writing in this study. The first is to
apply machine learning and data mining techniques to the same
sample used by Olsen to examine the degree to which
conclusions found in Koppel, Argamon, et al. can be replicated
for larger sample of French literary texts. The methodologies

used by Koppel, Argamon, et al. and Olsen may have privileged
identification of particular features, with Koppel focusing on
more stylistic aspects of writing and Olsen examining
significant frequency differences of content words. Use of a
common approach will allow us to examine the degree to which
gender differences can be compared between cultures and time
periods. We also expect use of machine learning techniques
will allow us to test Olsen's claim that gender differences in
French literature are best explained as examples of what
Liberman describes as "dominance" theories of gender
distinction. If the features that best characterize gender
difference are more "stylistic", this would suggest that
"difference" or two culture models are more applicable, but if
differences are shown in content words and these words are
used in similar ways, we would argue that the "dominance" or
political theory may be a more effective explanatory model.
And finally, we are comparing several distinct statistical
techniques, most notably Support Vector Machine (SVM) and
information gain models, to see which are most effective at
extracting weighted features that can be used to interpret
observed differences in male and female writing, comparing
these with more traditional examinations of differences in term
frequency. Becuase of the need to pick apart the learned model
to examine its inner workings, with the model itself as the end
product of the learning process, some Digital Humanities
applications of machine learning techniques will differ in
emphasis from more common data mining tasks, where the end
goal is often to maximize performance on the classification of
unknown data, and the model may be viewed as a black box.
This study is based on the creation of two samples of 300 texts
roughly balanced by genre, collection and time period driven
by texts by French women writers available to us. For each of
the 300 texts by 67 female authors (18.5 million words), we
selected the chronologically closest male document by genre
and, where available, by collection, leading to a comparison
collection of 300 texts by 170 authors (27 million words). As
noted in Olsen (2005), the samples are largely drawn from the
18th-early 20th centuries with strongest representation in the
19th century, owing to the predominance of romantic novelists
in the available collections of female writers. The sample is
also skewed by the presence of many works by particular
notable authors, in particular George Sand. The ARTFL project
is currently adding a large block of texts to our collection of
French Women Writers (FWW) and these will be integrated
into the full study, depending on how much is available in time.
Each text in the corpus has been prepared by first tokenizing
it and running it through TreeTagger to determine lemmas and
parts-of-speech for each token. In cases of uncertainty, each
possible assignment is assigned a probability value between 0
and 1 by TreeTagger; currently, we only consider the most
likely analysis for each token (though we will apply more
sophisticated techniques in the sequel). We consider in the
Page 11

Digital Humanities 2007
study several types of lexical features by which to represent
the texts numerically: Word Frequencies (WF), Lemma
Frequencies (LF), Part-of-speech Frequencies (PF), Word
Bigram Frequencies (WBF), Lemma Bigram Frequencies
(LBF), and POS Bigram Frequencies (PBF). For each such
feature set, we compute a vector of numeric values for each
text, where elements of the vector represent the relative
frequencies of various features in the set. For example, a WF
vector may contain entries for "la", "l'", "femme", and
"femmes", while the corresponding LF vector will contain
entries just for "la" and "femme", and the corresponding LBF
vector may contain an entry for "la/femme". Features that occur
less than 10 times in the entire corpus are elided; in some
experiments, more stringent criteria for feature inclusion will
be used, to see how few features we can get away with.
For classification, we are applying the SVM method; SVMs
are one of the most successful modern methods for text
categorization (Joachims 2002). We are currently working with
the Weka (Witten & Frank 2005) implementation, using a linear
kernel and the default parameters. (Other options do not appear
to improve accuracy by much, so we used the simplest option,
which also enables easier interpretation of the results.) As the
work progresses, we will be evaluating computational
efficiency, and may switch to other, faster, software codes if
necessary. The classification model constructed is a "linear
model", which means that it assigns a single numeric weight
to each input feature, positive for one input class (say, "femme")
and negative for the other (say, "homme"). The magnitude of
the weight corresponds to the importance or influence of the
feature's value for classification; high weights indicate those
features with the most effect on the classification of a given
text (in a specific model). Once classified by the SVM method,
we apply the information gain and other metrics (Forman et al.
2003) to identify those features that are most relevant to the
classification task. Tokens and lemmas found in this step will
be compared to differential frequency tables already used by
Olsen.
Preliminary classification results using Weka Sequential
Minimal Optimization (SMO) implementation of a support
vector classifier with 10 fold cross-validation confirm that
author gender in this sample can be detected with surprising
reliability. For the entire sample, gender of author was correctly
identified 85.9% of the time using word lemmas and 85.7% on
tokens, with lower performance for both generic POS (73%)
and more specific POS (75%). A second test on paired 100
document male/female collections, to reduce the number of
works by Sand and smooth other main sample anomalies,
achieved slightly better performance, with correct classification
by author gender at 87% for both surface word forms (tokens)
and lemmas, with POS again performing less well at 76.5%
and POSgroups (abstract POS) at 72%. The accuracy
performance of classifications based on tokens and lemmas
Page 12

(86% and 87%) is somewhat higher than the 70-80%
performance for a sample modern English documents reported
by Koppel et al. (2002) This may be due to our use of all of the
words in this experiment, suggesting that men and women tend
to write about different things and use somewhat different
vocabularies.
Table 1 shows the confusion matrix from the Weka SMO
classification expressed as the correct classification rate broken
down by feature type. In both samples, the highest performing
features (tokens and lemmas) are considerably better at
identification of male authors than female authors. We have
noted this difference in other recent work on modern English
data. Surprisingly, the opposite is true (in 3 of 4 instances) for
part of speech features, though it is unlikely that the differences
are statistically significant.

Table 1

Using a variety of techniques, we can effectively distinguish
between male and female authors. Examination of the highest
weighted features using the information gain (IG) measure on
the 2x92 subset sample reveals clear agreement with previous
work. Female authors show a strong preference for writing
about women (noted by the pronoun elle), adopt a more personal
and reflective frame (je, me), and address (vous). This is
consistently shown in both selected tokens and lemmas, and is
also indicated in the part of speech analysis by a preference for
the use of personal pronouns, indefinite pronouns and possessive
pronouns. Examination of tokens assigned a high information
gain in the subset selected to correct for sample biases reveals
the same female concern for descriptions of internal, subjective
and emotive states described by Olsen (2005). These terms
include émotions, amitié, chagrin, courage, craint* esprit*
desire. generosité, larmes, motifs, peines, penser, plaisirs,
réflexions, sensible, sentiment, sentis, soin*, and souffrance.
The IG measures are notable for some striking absences from
Olsen's examination, including terms like amour* and aim*
which were strongly correlated to female discourse, as well as
many kinship terms (oncle, maman, enfant, parents, etc.). Terms
with high information gain values that are more common in
male than female writers are less clearly grouped and are

Digital Humanities 2007
missing the strong preference noted in Olsen for abstractions
and numbers. However, when examining the PoS measures,
ordinal numbers are preferred by male writers. These variations
arise from using the IG measure as opposed to differences in
relative frequencies to assess "importance" and examination of
a small but more random sample, issues which will be explored
in the full paper.
Text mining techniques can identify gender of author using a
variety of models with impressive accuracy. The features ranked
most highly in learned classification tend to confirm previous
results and point to the possibility of cross-language patterns
of gendered language use. The full paper will explore the
reasons for the higher accuracy performance in identifying male
authors and examine in more detail the male and female author
feature sets with specific reference to the differences in ranked
features arising from different techniques. Finally, we will
address the larger question of whether the clear distinctions of
male and female public writing in this sample arise from a "two
cultures" interpretation or more conscious political stances by
a systematic analysis of word collocations around particularly
gender specific terms.

Introduction

T

he Picasso Project is a web-based, dynamic catalogue
raisonné currently containing digital images and
descriptive metadata for more than 11,000 of Picasso’s works
(Mallen, 2006). The catalogue includes commentary for many
artworks, along with notes detailing sales of the item,
exhibitions in which it has been displayed, and scholarly
literature in which it has been cited. In addition to these works,
the catalogue also provides extensive biographical information
including nearly 7,500 entries. The biography is linked to
artworks, photographs of key people, maps of the various places
Picasso lived and worked, and related documents (for example,
Picasso’s birth certificate). Tools are provided to support
side-by-side comparisons of two artworks and to build custom
subcollections from which an illustrated, color catalogue can
be automatically generated for printing. Within this context,
we have become increasingly interested in exploring Picasso’s
writings which have, until recently, been largely neglected in
favor of his more well known work in painting, sculpture, and
collage.
Picasso, first and foremost an artist, wrote texts that are
strikingly visual, both in terms of the design of the texts
themselves, as well as the decorative elements that adorn the
pages on which these texts are found. These intensely visual
writings
present
his
editor
with
significant
challenges—challenges that exemplify the TEI consortium's
Page 14

guidelines for when TEI should not be used (Lavagnino, 2006).
As Lavagnino points out, "to make the [TEI] edition work as
intended it is generally necessary to interpret features and not
merely reproduce their appearance." Picasso's writings do not
readily yield to a single fixed interpretation that can be
understood by an editor and transcribed in some definitive form.
Indeed, their interest stems, in part, from their complex and
indeterminate nature. Furthermore, transcription involves the
selection of relevant features of a work and production of a
digital (text plus encoding) description of them. In cases where
this digital description has little value for analysis, alternative
forms of presentation must be pursued. The two examples of
this cited by Lavagnino, "works intended as mixtures of words
and images, and very complex draft manuscripts in which the
sequence of text or inscription is difficult to make out," are both
characteristic of Picasso's writings.
Despite these difficulties, there have been a number of efforts
to produce transcriptions of Picasso’s writings as published
books (Bernadac, 1998; Michaël, 2005). This approach gives
primacy to the textual content of these works, at the expense
of losing almost all of the visual elements. To remedy this, most
editions include facsimile reproductions of illustrative samples
of his writings alongside the transcriptions. While this is helpful
in conveying a sense of the original context of these works, it
remains inadequate for many purposes. Beyond limitations of
scale (it is only feasible to include a limited number of
facsimiles), this approach treats the literal textual elements of
Picasso’s writings as

Figure 1: Two of Picasso's intensely visual texts.

primary, bringing in the images of the original, visually
constructed pages in order to illustrate and elaborate. This
approach to remediate the writings of Picasso divorces Picasso
the writer from Picasso the artist, limiting the productive
interchange of ideas that might result from a blending of literary
and art history-based approaches.
While Picasso’s writings provide a compelling example of the
limitations of a purely textual approach to representing
manuscripts and other documents, this problem is not unique.

Digital Humanities 2007
Within the digital textual studies community there is an
increasing recognition of the need to pair robust text encoding
with access to images of the original source material (Dicks,
1997; McGann, 2001). Over the past decade, a number of
projects have focused on presenting documents as images while
providing additional support via transcriptions (McGann, 1996;
Viscomi, 2002). Others have supplemented textually-oriented
systems by providing access to digitized images of the original
documents in a variety of formats (Furuta, 2001; Robinson,
1996). Image based representations of documents have placed
particular strain on hierarchical methods for representing and
encoding the features of a text and alternative formal models
have been proposed (Dekhtyar, 2006; Renear, Durand, and
Mylonas, 1993).

Approach

structural divisions or graphical bars rather than traditional
punctuation to divide conceptual segments of the text. These
tasks, which are difficult or impossible to perform

W

ithin the Picasso Project, we have encountered the
problem of developing digital representations of texts
from a different perspective than that found in either print based
transcriptions or in digital textual projects—namely, we have
treated Picasso’s writings, first as works of art, and secondarily
as art that contains text. By conceiving of and contextualizing
the writings of Picasso in a form common to traditional
approaches to art (that is, the catalogue raisonné) we are able
to reap immediate benefits for understanding these texts in ways
not readily supported by the tools grounded in a textual
approach to these works. This approach to visualizing Picasso's
texts places them squarely within the context of the other works
that he was painting and thinking about at the same time. This
helps inform our understanding of both the artworks that Picasso
produced as well as his writings. For example, Figure 2 shows
a typical thumbnail view of the last fifteen items in the catalogue
for the year 1935. In the poem in the center of the last line
(OPP.35:004), Picasso refers to a small girl. In the context of
drawings made by Picasso around the same time we see
connections with Picasso’s daughter, Maya, at three and three
and a half months old (OPP.35:031 and OPP.35:032), followed
by Marie-Thérèse, Maya’s mother (OPP.35:034). Similarly,
using the comparison tool to compare a text dated 28 November
1935 with a painting made earlier that year highlights possible
connections between verbal imagery of the text and the visual
imagery of the painting. References in the text to "tongue of
fire," "stabbing," and "the eye of the bull" take on new meanings
when seen in this context.
In addition to visually contextualizing writings in relationship
to Picasso’s other works, the digital catalogue raisonné (unlike
a corresponding print version) allows us to make accessible
images of Picasso’s writings suitable for reading and analysis.
Closer examinations of the text enables scholars to consider
multiple states of a text, to see annotations, deletions, and
additions to a text, to explore Picasso’s use of color to provide

Figure 3: Courses de taureaux and "lengua de fuego"

using transcriptions alone, are encouraged by the online
presentation. To further enable access to the textual component
of these works, we are initially adding transcriptions of these
texts to the biographical section of the catalogue. Since the
online catalogue presents the biographical text in parallel with
the artworks, this technique permits easy cross-referencing
between the transcriptions and images while we investigate
more sophisticated means for encoding and presenting the
content of these writings.

Implications and Future Work

F

raming our approach to Picasso’s writings in terms of
artworks that contain text, encourages us to look for text
in artworks in general. Like many other artists of his day,
Picasso began incorporating words into his artworks in a variety
of ways and forms, notably in the newspaper clippings pasted
Page 15

Digital Humanities 2007
into his papiers-collés. These works reinforce our conviction
that we need develop tools for working with text in art grounded
to the needs of the artistic disciplines rather than those of the
traditional textual studies community.
Picasso's unique works offer fertile ground for exploring the
techniques and tools that can be applied to visually constructed
texts but much work is needed—both in terms of understanding
the needs of the scholars and other readers interested in
Picasso’s writings as well as formulating new models for
representing and working with these texts in a digital
environment. We are currently investigating the potential for
techniques based in spatial hypertext research for interpreting
and presenting these texts. In spatial hypertext, Figure 3:
Courses de taureaux and "lengua de fuego" nodes of information
that are connected by visual elements (for example, text style,
2-D position, color) rather than by explicit links (Shipman,
1999). Our current efforts are focused in understanding how
the texts might be sub-divided into their constituent parts and
manipulated in a 2-D space in ways that enhance understanding.
We are also looking at how formal relationships between these
parts can be incrementally added as an expression of an
editor/reader's evolving understanding. In addition to purely
image based approaches, we are interested in studying methods
of encoding the textual content of Picasso's works to support
content based retrieval, enable automatic processing, and
facilitate reading.

Summary
By translating a traditional print-based approach for working
with a large corpus of artworks, the catalogue raisonné, into a
digital format, we increase the level of support provided for
three scholarly primitives (Unsworth, 2000): comparing (either
two works side by side, or many works in a thumbnail view),
sampling select artworks from the collection as a whole, and
representing the artworks not merely as thumbnails, but also
with higher resolution images. With these enhancements, the
digital catalogue raisonné, though not its printed counter-part,
provides a natural medium for presenting the writings of
Picasso. In this context, his writings are presented against the
backdrop of other artworks while enabling the textual elements
of these artworks to be read and carefully studied as texts. In
addition to the immediate benefits that this approach brings in
terms of accessing Picasso’s writings, it also offers a new
paradigm for working with these texts that suggests several
promising directions for further work.

1. Introduction

T

he explosive growth of digital and digitized text creates
opportunities for scholars and students to conduct new
analyses and develop unique insights about our written culture
and heritage. To effectively use large collections of textual data,
scholars and students need flexible, easy to use tools that
provide powerful analysis and visualization.

1.1 Goals
The Automated Learning Group is developing interactive tools
for mining large, complex semantic networks, which were
automatically extracted from a text corpus. The corpus could
be a collection of documents or a stream of messages. The
Page 17

Digital Humanities 2007
semantic network represents the concepts in the collection as
entities and relations. The visual environment allows the user
to query the semantic network to retrieve portions of the graph.
The display allows the user to view and navigate these networks
to discover patterns in the collection.

1.2 Technical Approach

O

ur approach to the visual analysis of text documents
implements extraction and visualization of important
entities and the relations among them. This is accomplished in
the following high-level steps:
1. Perform lexical analysis of textual document set
2. Extract key entities and relations from the text
3. Compose entity-relation triples into semantic network model
summarizing key information in document corpus
4. “Publish” the semantic network in a repository
5. Visualize semantic network model as graph
6. Search and prune visual graph through appropriately
structured queries against semantic network model.

2 Text Analysis

T

extual processing is accomplished by passing documents
through a series of syntactic, semantic, and functional
analysis tools. These tools primarily consist of D2K 1and T2K,
our own analytic software, working in concert with GATE 2and
MontyLingua 3. These tools are seamlessly connected together
into the D2K visual programming environment
The GATE toolkit is utilized for standard syntactic processes
including tokenization, sentence splitting, and part-of-speech
tagging. Syntactically annotated documents are passed to
GATE’s Named Entity (NE) tagger. The GATE NE tagger
identifies proper nouns in the text that belong to relevant
categories such as “Person”, “Organization”, and “Location.”
NE tagging passes through three modules that perform different
kinds of co-reference2. The final output of the NE tagging and
co-referencing processes are a set of annotations that identify
references to “Person”, “Organization”, and “Location” entities.
After NE extraction, we identify key relations in the text using
a tool within MontyLingua. This Jister tool extracts sentence
structures called “jists,” which carry thematic-role information
such as verb, subject, and object. This is similar to semantic
role labeling 2, but less formally structured. An example jist:
Tiger Woods wrapped up the tournament at noon.
(Verb: ‘wrap up’, Subj: ‘Tiger Woods’,
Obj1: ‘tournament’,Obj2: ‘at noon’)
Page 18

The next step involves the normalization of references in the
MontyLingua jists with entities identified in the analysis. For
example, “Tiger Woods” may have been identified as a
entity:PERSON, and “tournament” referenced back to “Masters
Golf Tournament” appearing earlier in the text. Tagging the
verb “wrap up” as an entity:ACTION, and “at noon” as a TIME
relation to the verb, we can generate triples as follows: <Tiger
Woods> <is-a> <entity:PERSON> <Masters Golf
Tournament> <is-a> <entity:EVENT> <wrap
up> <is-a> <entity:ACTION> <Tiger Woods>
<actor> <wrap up>
Figure 1 shows the D2K toolkit with a view of the text
processing itinerary. The itinerary is a dataflow graph: the nodes
in the figure are D2K modules (major processing blocks),
connected by edges representing the flow of data during
execution. The itinerary can exploit both data parallelism
(multiple documents at the same time) and task parallelism
(different modules in parallel). The D2K itinerary can be run
on a desktop or scaled up to multiple computers or High
Performance Computer systems.Figure 1 shows the D2K toolkit

High Performance Computer systems.

3 Semantic Network Storage and
Retrieval

T

he triples generated from the semantic extraction process
are stored in an RDF 5metadata store. We use Kowari,
developed by Tucana Technologies 6. Additional triples are
generated to represent metadata in conformance with a common
vocabulary, and user annotations can be included as well.
Queries are coded in an SQL-like query language called iTQL.
The result is a set of triples, which represents a semantic graph
6
.
This architecture demonstrates a key design principle for robust
Cyberinfrastructure. The analysis is decoupled from the
visualization, so that a large scale analysis can asynchronously
update the triples as new results are computed, while interactive
tools will automatically pick up the new data by refreshing the
query. The triples generated from the semantic extraction
process can be combined with many other similar relation triples
from many sources, and additional triples are generated to
represent a common vocabulary.

4 Visual Investigation of Semantic
Networks

U

sing the visual environment, investigators can perform
searches over the semantic networks extracted from a
text corpus. The familiar web browser paradigm was employed
in the user interface design. The user interface allows one to
construct more complex queries by incorporating multiple rules
and filters. Each user query is converted into iTQL and executed
by the Kowari server6 . The query history is available as a
pull-down menu, just as query histories are in a web browser.
Investigators can directly observe semantic relationships
between entities in an interactive link-node graph visualization.

Relations between entities in the resulting semantic network
graph are displayed as a link-node graph visualized using
Prefuse 7, and also as a hierarchical tree of entities conforming
to the common vocabulary. The subject and object entities in
the relations are displayed as nodes in the graph visualization,
predicates are displayed as links. This simplification of the
more complex semantic network, stored in Kowari, provides a
compact and usable abstraction of the important relations
extracted from the text streams.
The Entity pane at the upper left displays lists of entities. The
Relations pane at the lower left displays a list of relations, with
additional options to highlight synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms
or hypernyms based on WordNet. Selecting an entity in the left
pane also highlights the corresponding node or edge in the
visualization.
Every entity in the graph maintains a link back to the original
text document from which it was extracted. By right-clicking
on a node, and selecting View Source Documents, the text of
the original document will be retrieved from the repository and
displayed.

viewed and navigated to discover patterns and relations within

6 Conclusion

T

his paper described interactive tools for mining large,
complex semantic networks automatically extracted from
a text corpus. These approaches can be applied to news feeds,
technical literature, or literary collections.
We believe this is a promising approach, although we are only
beginning to develop these tools for use by humanists, who
will be the ultimate judges of the utility and validity of this
approach. The general purpose semantic analysis is widely
applicable to many types of text, though it is difficult to predict
the impact of such analysis on our understanding of texts.
The query interface and graphical displays are still under
development. The entity-relationship graphs may be quite
complicated, so we must find new visual methods and
metaphors to enable scholars and students to understand the
information in the graphs, and to use them formulate
hypotheses, and answer questions.

he Text Encoding Initiative Consortium1 claims that its
new Guidelines (P5)2 can be customized for almost any
purpose, including writing new documents (as opposed to
transcribing existing ones). This author regularly teaches
workshops on text encoding using the Text Encoding Initiative
Guidelines, and believes it is important that TEI advocates “eat
our own dog food” — that is, we should use TEI to encode the
documents used to teach TEI. This includes the slides displayed
during a presentation or lecture, and any associated handouts.
Initially the author’s workshops were written in TEI Lite and
the slides were created using Sebastian Rahtz’s stylesheets for
slides provided by the TEI Consortium. Quite quickly it became
clear that a more reliable, better documented, and easier to use
system was needed; the hallmark feature of such a system would
be a highly constrained schema tailored to the needs of a
workshop presentation.

T

Such a highly constrained schema tailored to the particular
purpose has several important advantages. First, it makes
authoring much easier. A large variety of elements that make
no sense in the context of a workshop slide are available in TEI
Lite, e.g. <gap> or <interpGrp>. When writing slides for
the workshop, the author needs to pick and choose from among
the available elements, including those which make no sense.
Eliminating these makes the author’s encoding task much
simpler. Second, the semantics of elements can be expressed
more explicitly. E.g., a <slide> element can be used instead
of <div type="slide"> . This may seem like a minor
point, but the third advantage requires it: that constraints
required for the purpose can be enforced in the schema. E.g.,
in TEI Lite the <head> element is an optional child of a
<div>, whereas it can be made a required child of a <slide>,
and still be an optional child of a <div>.
In order to ascertain how difficult it is to create such a highly
constrained, specialized schema using P5, a new system was
developed using the TEI’s new ODD (one document does it
all) system.3 Because there are already quite a few presentation
systems available to the workshop instructor, both proprietary
and open, both XML-based and others, the new system is called
Yet Another Presentation System, or “yaps”. Accordingly, its
icon is a dog. Yaps provides the capability to write a single

Digital Humanities 2007
document for a presentation, and from that document create
slides, notes intended for the lecturer, and notes intended to be
part of a hand-out for participants. The system is well
documented, with an intended audience being a person who is
familiar with TEI and is generally technologically savvy, but
may not have much direct experience with complex
transformations and stylesheets. Many such TEI users use the
commercial XML editor oXygen, which includes most of the
needed software packages (e.g., xmllint and Saxon 8) built-in.
Therefore instructions are provided for using the system from
within oXygen, as well as from the command-line.
The system comprises (in order of academic interest):
•

•
•
•

•

An extensive TEI customization which provides a TEI
markup language for presentations, and documentation for
the use of that language.
An XSLT stylesheet that transforms a document conforming
to the markup language described by the ODD to XHTML.
CSS stylesheets for viewing both the source and the various
outputs in a browser.
A shell script front-end (for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, or
similar systems) for executing the commands necessary to
generate the system documentation and schemas from the
ODD file. This relies on roma.sh, the ODD processing tool
written for the TEI by Sebastian Rahtz.4
A shell script front-end (for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, or
similar systems) for executing the commands necessary to

constrained. For example, even in cases where order would be
irrelevant as far as processing is concerned, a particular order
is required by the schema primarily for the benefit of the author,
who has to make fewer guesses about what should come next,
and make few if any decisions between equivalent encodings.
The yaps language was not designed as a standalone language
and then retrofitted to TEI, but neither were significant
compromises to the desired language made to make it easy to
express it as a TEI language. Thus the customization ODD is
somewhat complicated in order that the end result be a simple,
applicable language. For example, the <body> element with
its <div>s is replaced by a <presentation> element which
has nothing but <section> (or <sectionGrp>) children.
It would have been easier to design a customization which used
<div type="section">. While this would have been
semantically equivalent, it is not possible (in ODD) to provide
the desired syntactic constraints on <div>, whereas it is easy
to provide such constraints on <section>.
There are only three possible children of a <section>: one
for a slide, one for instructor’s notes, and one for an
accompanying handout. There are currently only 96 elements
defined in this language, many of which are metadata elements
used in the <teiHeader>. As an example of its simplicity,
there are only 14 elements available to an author writing the
content of a <slide>; there are well over twice that many
available to the author of a TEI Lite document using <div
type="slide">.

XSLT
TEI customization

T

he TEI customization or ODD file that defines both the
yaps schema and its documentation is large (currently
almost 2000 lines) and thorough. It demonstrates several
interesting features (e.g., deletion of classes, use of
Schematron). But more controversially, the documentation
therein is not only for the language described, but is also the
documentation for its use. This is certainly not a “pure” or
intended use of TEI ODD, and some might even say it is
inappropriate. On the other hand, ODD provides a reasonable
place for such documentation, and TEI provides a reasonably
rich and familiar language with which to write such
documentation.
The markup language described by the ODD is much smaller
and far more structured than the TEI most of us are used to.
From the beginning the goal has been to create a markup
language that would be easy to use (because the authors using
it are already well versed in TEI), but constructed specifically
for the production of slides and associated materials to be used
during a presentation. The language is deliberately highly

T

he stylesheet is a single parameterized XSLT 2.0
stylesheet that is over 1000 lines long. It creates relatively
abstract valid XHTML output (i.e., most of the input YAPS
elements are represented by XHTML <span> elements that
make use of the class= attribute). I am hopeful that it is of
high enough quality to be a useful example for beginners;
simultaneously I am hoping XSLT experts will be able to
provide pointers and advice on improvements.

Further Features

A

lthough the system is quite usable in its current state (Julia
Flanders, Christian Wittern, and I have all made use of
it for workshops) there are, of course, a lot of improvements
still to be made. Many of these improvements I expect to have
in place before the conference.

n the epigraph for our session, Duderstadt succinctly
describes a major challenge facing the humanities –
specifically the scholars who make the practice of humanities
research their own – as they head into a digital future. The
typical scholar in the humanities is generally perceived as a
loner, an individual working more or less in isolation towards
publications that will be his or her sole responsibility. Scholars
are not completely isolated, of course. The sharing of
pre-publication knowledge is common, and workshops and
conferences abound in all fields to give scholars the opportunity
to find out what others are doing, to present their own work to
the community, and to talk with others whose interests and
research overlap their own. However, as a glance at the contents
pages of the most recent issue of any historical or literary
journal will suggest, it is not common for more than one
humanist to claim authorship for a single piece of scholarship.
There is contrast here with scholarship in the hard sciences and
engineering, where much work is done by groups, collaboration
is the norm, and where several people usually claim authorship
to any one publication. Digital humanities inherits from both

Digital Humanities 2007
of these traditions, encouraging cross-disciplinary collaboration
within a community that has traditionally valued independence.
This short paper session will present the experiences of three
scholars working more or less in isolation within the context
of this collaborative environment. These individuals are alike
in that they are all actively involved in the development of
digital projects, but their experiences vary widely with regard
to time available for working on these projects, their own
technical/programming skills and like support available from
their institutions, and the availability of funding to support their
projects. In addition to these three scholars, we also welcome
two others whose work exists to support the efforts of solitary
scholars. However, it may be seen that even "solitary" scholars
are not so alone in the digital humanities.

"I'm ready to start a project! What
do I need to know?"

O

ur first two speakers represent the technically skilled
scholar.

Birnbaum has developed two XML-related projects on his own
and he will report on the logistics of these projects. Funding
and support for both projects is light and he is responsible for
all the technology, although his colleagues provide philological
knowledge.
Norton will discuss his experience as a computer scientist with
a PhD in Music History developing a project on digital
representations of medieval liturgical manuscripts. He is
working on the project independently, and while he has the
programming and design skills necessary for success, he is
facing limitations of time (as he is also trying to write a book,
a familiar problem for many).

"Well, how do I learn?"

ur third speaker will discuss alternatives for solitary
scholars to learn how to take steps towards developing
digital projects.

available to scholars for integration into their electronic text
projects. Rockwell will discuss the TAPoR tools, and will
discuss how scholars working in isolation can take advantage
of them without the need for programming experience or access
to programming support.

"I have the skills, I have a great
idea... what about funding?"

O

ur final two speakers will present two different aspects
of acquiring funding for digital humanities projects.

Patrik will discuss issues that she has encountered while
attempting to organize a TEI encoding project at a liberal arts
college. Although Patrik's institution is supportive of her digital
endeavors, she has not had success applying for funds from the
major funding agencies. Unfortunately, without access to
graduate student labor and a dedicated support staff and with
the lack of time that comes from being a full-time professor in
an institution where the focus is on undergraduate teaching,
Patrik is at a disadvantage. She is interested in exploring the
possibilities of collaborating with larger institutions, moving
from isolation to collaboration.
Winter will discuss the NEH Digital Humanities Initiative, and
how the initiative can support the work of solitary or
independent project directors. He will focus on two of the new
DH-specific grant initiatives: Digital Humanities Start-Up
Grants
(<http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/dig
italhumanitiesstartup.html>)
and
Digital
Humanities Fellowships
(<http://www.neh.gov/grants/guidelines/dhf
ellowships.html>).
Each of our speakers will have seven to ten minutes to discuss
his or her work, making reference to limitations of time,
technical support, and funding, and how those limits impact
their projects. The remainder of the session will be a roundtable
discussion, and the audience will be encouraged to ask questions
of the panel and to discuss their own experiences working in
isolation

Rockwell will talk first about how to take advantage of
university resources. Many universities have Teaching and
Learning Centers and Digital Library Services that you can
draw on for help. Some universities have special Humanities
Computing units that specialize in supporting digital projects
in the humanities. Rockwell will summarize some of the
services you can look for at your university.
In addition, Rockwell will speak as a the project leader of the
Text Analysis Portal for Research (TAPoR) project (<http:
//www.tapor.ca/>), which makes text analysis tools

I

n many Digital Humanities projects, the focus has been on
acquiring, digitizing, and encoding materials for online
search and retrieval, rather than on interface design. A common
notion in Humanities computing, carried over from the
information technology industry, is that content should be
prepared so as to as to be deliverable through pre-existing
interfaces as well as those yet to be conceived. But this
procedure suits developers more than users. Simply making a
wealth of primary and supplemental materials available in
digital form does not make them usable. Moreover, the practice
of coding and representing humanities materials as information
objects flies in the face of many humanities scholars and
teachers, who view works of art and culture as historically and
materially situated, as unique combinations of form and content.
Digital humanists, rather than merely archiving these materials
in standard formats, should design interfaces that bespeak their
unique qualities and accommodate the desiderata of scholars,
teachers, and students.
In designing the interface for our own project, we began with
the premise that new media can be used to enhance student
comprehension of complex poems, even those for which print
resources are rich and abundant. The complex poem we had in
mind was John Milton’s Paradise Lost (hereafter, PL), perhaps
the single literary work most often assigned to English-speaking
university students around the world. Whether students run
through excerpts from PL in a sophomore survey or pore over
the entire epic in an upper-division course, they famously find
Milton’s poetry difficult to follow. Instructors usually assume
that this difficulty owes to its unfamiliar ideas and Milton’s
intimidating erudition—and surely these are part of the problem.
But we have found that when students hear an instructor declaim
passages from PL as they follow along in their textbooks, the
thrust of the lines suddenly becomes plainer. Recent research
on multimedia learning indicates that distinct, additive cognitive
pathways mediate the aural and visual reception of language
(Mayer 2001). Reading and listening to the same text
demonstrably improves understanding and recall.

Page 24

The aural register is especially crucial for the study of PL. Blind
Milton composed his epic orally, dictating it to amanuenses
and even insisting that he was relaying what the Muse had first
dictated to him as he slept. The original text of PL, then, was
not a mute manuscript but a narrative voice attentively heard
and transcribed. Even when present-day students successfully
comprehend Milton’s poetry during a solitary, silent reading,
reading through the eyes alone diminishes the aural impact of
the verse and the voice as its medium. Instructors and students
now seem to be recognizing that the merely visual reading of
PL leaves something to be desired. In recent years an increasing
number of marathon group readings of Milton’s epic has
occurred at colleges and even high schools in the U.S.A. and
elsewhere. Such voluntary meetings are unlikely to become
standard practice any time soon, however, and classroom time
does not permit instructors to read aloud or play a recording of
the poem (10,565 lines), even if they recognize that
comprehension increases markedly when students both see and
hear the text.
In the fall of 2004, having thought through this pedagogical
situation, we developed an interface design that would correlate
an electronic text with an audio track of PL. We then solicited
volunteers to record Book Nine, the selection most often
anthologized and assigned to undergraduates. In the spring of
2005, with the aid of a Liberal Arts Instructional Technology
Services (LAITS) grant, we developed a prototype “audiotext”
of Book Nine. This prototype, which is now publicly available
at <http://www.laits.utexas.edu/miltonpl/>,
uses Adobe/Macromedia Flash technology to synchronize a
modernized text with audio and annotations within a single
window designed to look like an open book. It uses a
karaoke-style moving highlight to indicate the line being voiced
and an optional stationary highlight to mark annotated words
and phrases. Because Flash is not free software, some may
object to its widespread use in digital humanities projects. But
developing the audiotext with an open standard such as SMIL
and/or SVG would have been far more difficult, if not
impossible. Furthermore, Adobe has released the Flash file
format specification (SWF), spawning a large and robust open
source Flash community as well as third party software that
generates SWF files. The SWF format now rivals PDF and
HTML in readability and accessibility, respectively. Making
the audiotext accessible to users who require screen readers
seemed particularly important to us, given a work composed
by Milton.
During the Fall of 2005, more than 200 students tested the
prototype in various courses: a freshman honors seminar in
world literature, a large lecture section of the mandatory
sophomore literature survey, and an upper division course
devoted to Milton. According to the results of an anonymous
survey administered by the instructors, the majority of students
(91%) said that they understood the action better than they did

Digital Humanities 2007
when using a print version only. Such improvement in
comprehension implies that students also better understood
Milton's notoriously intricate syntax, line by line, and thus
became more sophisticated readers overall. These student
surveys, as well as comments we received from instructors,
testify to the pedagogical utility of our design. But we also
believe that our interface provides a better solution for scholars
and general readers. Although we have deliberately adhered to
the logic and aesthetics of the printed page, our design also
uses the capacities of contemporary information technology to
improve upon the book. During audio playback, the pages turn
automatically, minimizing the cognitive break of page-turning
and further encouraging users to continue uninterrupted with
the reading.
More importantly, our design solves a problem of print
technology that has persisted in digital technology: the tendency
of supplemental materials, such as explanatory or textual notes,
to disrupt the sort of immersive reading experience vital to the
understanding of challenging literary texts. Although notes can
enrich a reader’s appreciation, when they are printed on the
same page as the primary text (footnotes), they can be visually
and mentally distracting. On the other hand, if they are printed
in an appendix (endnotes), they are difficult to compare with
the primary text and are in practice often ignored altogether.
Unfortunately, the majority of hypertexts and ebooks have
simply reproduced footnote or endnote schemes. Our interface
design exploits Flash technology to smooth out this age-old
snag in reading, allowing the user to make notes and other
supplements appear and disappear as needed, without scrolling,
turning pages, or negotiating multiple windows or frames. When
the audiotext is in annotation mode, explanatory notes simply
replace the text on the page facing the one being read/heard.

departure from the “Web 2.0” movement, a convergence of
applications that make the network, rather than the user’s own
computer, the platform. Although our interface design is
applicable to many of these technologies, the audiotext itself
provides an example of a richer and more flexible desktop
solution for teachers and students than print books or ebooks.
Ultimately, we hope to complete audiotexts of all twelve books.
In 2006-2007, with the help of a second LAITS grant, we are
developing Books One and Two. John Rumrich has also applied
for an NEH Digital Humanities Fellowship that would enable
him to complete additional audiotexts in 2007-2008. In the next
phase of the project, we plan to develop a separate front-end
utility that will search the text of the poem in an XML document
that conforms to the P5 guidelines of the Text Encoding
Initiative. This utility, which will also be able to search the
annotations and user notes, will return results that correspond
and connect to specific pages in the audiotexts.

In the spring of 2005, we responded to student and instructor
feedback by adding two more viewing modes to the prototype.
The “comparison” mode displays our modernized reading text
in parallel with a diplomatic transcript of the 1674 text on which
it is based. This mode allows teachers to point out differences
in orthography and punctuation without asking their students
to consult a facsimile edition. The “your notes” mode,
meanwhile, allows students to edit and save their own notes
for each page. These notes are stored on the student’s computer
in a separate file, from which they are then imported for each
new session. This mode thus reproduces a capacity of print
books seldom reproduced in electronic formats—space for
readers’ own annotative marginalia. Teachers who ask their
students to keep reading journals may find this mode especially
useful. Unlike similar features in Blackboard and other online
classroom systems, the notes are individually rather than
collaboratively composed, and the mode does not require
usernames and passwords. In fact, we encourage users to
download the audiotext for offline use rather than load it online
in their browsers. The audiotext in this regard represents a

The Encoding of Terminology
Related to the Medieval Slavic
Manuscripts: Philological and
Technological Results and
Perspectives

University of Sofia

T

he author of the presentation makes an attempt to
summarize problems and prospects concerning
terminology used in computer supported description of Slavic
manuscripts in two Slavic languages – Bulgarian and Russian,
and, at the same time – in English and German. The report is
a result of a working team in the Bulgarian Academy of
Sciences and Sofia University: Anisava Miltenova (Institute of
Literature, director of the project), Andrej Bojadžiev (University
of Sofia), Margaret Dimitrova (University of Sofia), Irina
Kuzidova (Institute of Literature), Regina Koycheva (Institute
of Literature), Maya Petrova (Institute of Literature), and Svetla
Koeva (Institute of Bulgarian Language). They are working in
the frames of the project Metadata and Electronic Catalogues
(2004–08), a component of the Repertorium of Old Bulgarian
Literature and Letters. The project is oriented to create
electronic catalogues and authority files that will serve as
integrated repositories of terminological information that has
been developed and applied successfully in already existing
projects in the realm of medieval Slavic languages, literatures,
and cultures. One innovative feature of this project is that
beyond serving as a central repository for such information, it
will expand the organizational framework to support a
multilingual superstructure along the lines of I18N initiatives
elsewhere in the world of electronic text technology in general
and humanities computing in particular.
The project presumes the possibility of linking the standardized
terminological apparatus for description, study, edition, and
translation of medieval texts, on the one hand, to authoritative
lists of key-words and terms used in bibliographic descriptions,
on the other. This will allow the integration of scholarly
meta-data and bibliographic references under a single unified
framework. Another aim of the project is to create a mechanism
for allowing the extraction of different types of indices based
upon the imported documents even when the languages of
encoding may vary. The primary manuscript description texts
Page 26

are encoded in a TEI-based XML format in the context of the
broader Repertorium initiative, and their utility for the type of
multilingual authority files, bibliographic databases, and other
broad reference resources illustrates the multipurposing that is
characteristic of XML documents in the humanities, but on a
broader scale than is usual.
One of the project’s main aims is to propose an approach with
the help of which the main terms of the Medieval culture could
be further explained with the original texts, translations and
current research activities. In this respect we could distinguish
several areas of knowledge: name of the various texts and
principles of such a naming, the author of the text(s) and
problems related with the transliteration and transcriptions of
the names; terms related to the text history its structure and
function; the language(s) of the text; the relationship between
the text and the codex; the Medieval mankind represented in
the texts, etc. This project is based on distinguishing the
meanings of particular terms and notions that appear in the text
of medieval written documents both within the primary corpus
and in comparison to established scholarly terminology.
In the frame of the project several types of indices have been
created: names of the texts (in four languages), genre
terminology (in the field of hymnography, hagiography,
homiletic literature, different kinds of instructions, etc.), types
of manuscripts (concerning their function), palaeographic and
codicological terms, linguistic terminology These indices could
be divided into two types:

Entries in the form of lists which contain information for
usage of particular notion in the original Medieval texts .
Entries in the form of terminological XML tool, which
contain research metadata, in the form of thesaurus.

The main difference between the both is the absence (in the
former) and the presence (in the latter) of definitions, and a
strict hierarchy of concepts. The first type of the information
represents a simple multilingual list of terms. The function of
this list could be explained as “It could be the standard way to
say this or to write this”. The entries of the second type have
more sophisticated structure, very close resembling to the
encyclopaedic article. A compulsory element of this type of
entries is the reference to the authority source, from which the
material is extracted and which is very appreciated among
scholars. In the informational area the specifications to the
particular standards are used.
The project is very actual in the context of discussions in the
frames of ISO activities for definitions of markup of the
terminological information (cf. TMF: Terminological Markup
Framework). Our model is based on the approved standard ISO
12000. The report includes demonstration of the current
project’s results both in the philological and technical aspects.

Making a Contribution:
Modularity, Integration and
Collaboration Between Tools in
Pliny

C

omputing tools have been an issue since the foundation
of Humanities Computing, and building modular tools
that work together has been recognised as important since at
least the CETH meetings in 1995. Geoffrey Rockwell and I
first raised issues of modularity in our paper given at the
Canadian Learned Societies Conference in June 1992 entitled
“Towards new Research Tools in Computer-Assisted Text
Analysis”. Our proposed tool framework combined data-flow
tool modularity with the ability to create pages that mixed
scholarly writing with interactive elements like in a
Mathematica “Notebook”. Of course the WWW was sweeping
all this away by 1995 and when we took a paper (Bradley,
Rockwell 1995) to the CETH “tools” meeting we were merging
our modular view with the WWW as it was then emerging.
In our community “modularity” often comes down to the
sharing of file formats. Separate tools that can all read the same
file format can all operate on common data, and therefore can
contribute their particular facilities to the task at hand. File- or
Unix-style modularity is a part of what I called the
“transformation model” of computing (Bradley 2005), and
provides a powerful approach to manipulating data. TuStep
(described in Ott 2000) is a splendid example. The model holds
a strong attraction within the Digital Humanities community –
even extraordinarily creative projects as TAPoR’s text analysis
portal (TAPoR 2006) or the Nora project (Nora 2006) are, in
fact, primarily based on this. However, thinking of modularity
primarily in those terms limits our views to those of computing
about 25 years ago – before the advent of the graphical user
interface (GUI).
The GUI radically changed the way we think about computing,
and even today, more than 25 years later, its significance
continues to reverberate. It is surely true to say that most
humanists have the GUI as a model driving how they think of
their computer. The impact has been twofold:

•

•

First, users now expect that the computer screen will allow
them to directly manipulate materials that interest them.
Think of the words in a word processor.
Second, interaction between tools needs to be possible not
only between files, but also on the screen as well. Users
expect to be able to incorporate parts of spreadsheets inside
word documents, for example.

To reflect this broader sense of collaboration between tools,
we need some different language. In this paper I will use the
word integration for that aspect of tool collaboration that
focuses on GUI issues. The use of integration might make us
also think of the integrative nature of humanities scholarship
– an intentional parallel.
Integration in the GUI presents challenges. First, the
development of tools allowing for direct manipulation of objects
on the screen is more complex and costly than resolving
file-sharing issues. Furthermore, if independent tools are to
interact on the screen – elements maintained by potentially
different tools sharing screen space – then they must operate
in a computing framework that makes this kind of thing
practical.
Pliny (Pliny 2006) has been developed precisely to draw
attention to these two issues and to encourage some thinking
about cooperating tools beyond file-oriented “modularity”. It
both significantly broadens how computers can support
humanities research and suggests a much richer and more
acceptable interface to those tools that might well attract a larger
number of scholars. Pliny tackles this in two ways. First, it is
supports annotation and note taking – functions central to
several aspects of humanities scholarship and which I believe
have been largely neglected by the DH community – and,
second, it is built using a framework called Eclipse (Eclipse
2006) which is deliberatively created to support GUI-level
interaction between tools of the kind I mentioned above. Eclipse
also supports rich collaboration between tools developed by
independent developers.
Personal annotation and note-taking compels us to think about
tool integration because it is widespread in humanities
scholarship and runs across all kinds of scholarly work. Scholars
write notes to record their reactions to not only books they read,
but also web pages they view. Furthermore, if they have tools
that do (say) text analysis, they would probably want to record
notes about that as well. The provision of note-taking within a
particular website is insufficient for personal note-taking
(although it might well fulfil a useful need supporting public
comment about the material the website offers) because most
scholars work across a broad range of materials, and their note
taking capability must reflect this. Notes from a book will at
some point need to be brought in contact with notes about, say,
an online archive or a journal, or about findings from the text
Page 27

Digital Humanities 2007
analysis tool. Personal scholarly note taking integrates by its
very nature.
Personal annotation also draws our attention back to the
software application as the context in which tools can and
should be built, rather than thinking of the browser as the
context for tool delivery. It is surprising how difficult it is to
make this point to those in the Digital Humanities. Of course
part of the reason is that XML, one of the key technologies that
fuels some portion of the DH community, has been developed
specifically to work in the context of the WWW. However, if
we wish to develop a more broadly based humanities
community who use technology in more sophisticated ways to
support their research we need to broaden our focus beyond
the WWW. Providing scholarly resources on the WWW
supports scholars, of course, and there remains some excitement
that they can get materials readily right to their desktop.
However, as I argued in Bradley 2005, once on that desktop
all they can do with them is read them on the screen or print
them out – a webpage, even one designed with all the clever
parts of CSS and AJAX, allows only manipulation within its
own page context. It contributes little to the integrative aspect
of personal scholarship which must, by its very nature, often
bring materials together from disparate sources.
Software Applications work with personal materials. Surely
this is a central element of humanities scholarship. A word
processor creates materials that belong to the researcher. Until
web browsers can be used to create materials that are stored as
personal data – on the user’s own machine – they cannot replace
applications (see a similar assertion from a technical perspective
in Charland 2005). Even the XML folk – part of the community
driving a WWW view of humanities computing because of
XML’s compatibility with website creation – use an application
such as Oxygen to create XML materials in the first place. For
the same reason that the creation of an XML file involves an
editor rather than a web browser, the creation of personal notes
– especially those gathered from reactions across a great range
of sources – requires a personal application. Furthermore, more
than one study into computing and humanities scholarship (see
both Brockman et al and Siemens et al 2004) has found that
scholars have tried to apply inappropriate applications such as
word processors to support this need, and have not been very
satisfied with the result.
Applications can be built in several different frameworks. Pliny
is written in Java using the Eclipse framework rather than the
one provided by Sun to create desktop tools. I didn’t choose
Eclipse because it was easy for me to use it – indeed I had to
learn it from the beginning during the past year or so. I choose
Eclipse because it is designed specifically to support the
integration of tools developed by separate developers. Eclipse
provides a way to share out screen space between windows
managed by different tools. Furthermore, it also provides
Page 28

mechanisms for elements from separate tools to share the same
window (called “making a contribution” in Eclipse). Tools built
with the Eclipse plug-in model need not operate in isolation
from other related tools. A text analysis tool built in Eclipse
could use Pliny elements to allow users to record notes while
using the TA tool, and the notes that were recorded in this way
would also be visible in the context of notes created with other
materials – say from reading a book, or annotating a web page.
So, in this presentation I have an impossible task. First, I am
promoting the idea that we focus more on application
development than web development, a technically more
demanding activity, and one that goes against the grain of much
work in DH over the last decade. Second, for those who might
subscribe to this idea, I am promoting that we build our tools
according to the Eclipse model rather than the more widely
understood Sun/Java framework. Perhaps I won’t convince
anyone here. However, I believe that unless we start to think
of tools in the context of applications, as our scholarly
community does, and unless we start to think more seriously
of tool building in the context of GUI integration in addition
to data sharing, we will never get the attention of most scholars
in the humanities.

iverWeb (<http://www.riverweb.uiuc.edu>)
is a web-based education and outreach program to
promote environmental education and historical awareness
about rivers and their watersheds. One aspect of the project is
an extensive collection of historical materials pertaining to early
settlements in the “American Bottom,” a location just south of
the confluence of the Mississippi, Illinois and Missouri rivers,
near modern-day St. Louis. This also includes a large historical
record of the early development of East St. Louis (IL), from its
early settlement through the twentieth century, up to and
including the most recent census.
This poster illustrates efforts to spatially enable the RiverWeb
collection. The outcome is a dynamic web mapping application
that forms a browser-based flexible user interface to the
collection of historical materials, newspaper clippings,
directories and census information. The system has been built
using open source software compatible with Open GIS
Consortium (OGC) standards and includes web mapping
functionality, a gazetteer and basic geovisualization. The paper
describes the design and architecture of the system and the

implementation of the linkage between the historical
information and its spatial imprint. This is illustrated with a
historical analysis of neighborhood change in East St. Louis as
a result of redlining policies in the early 20th century. Change
in neighborhood profile over time and across space can be
visualized and basic exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA)
techniques provide ways to quantify these patterns.

Distributed Multivalent
Encoding
Paul Caton (Paul_Caton@brown.edu)
Brown University
Distributed multivalent encoding (DME) describes a web-based
text encoding practice and the result of that practice. It assumes
a digital text resource with a browser interface that allow users
to associate N encodings with N texts in the resource. Users
need have no other connection with the resource than their
using it and constraints should be minimal; hence the encoding
is distributed among multiple creators and multiple conceptual
approaches. To realize their encoding(s) users may ignore
existing encodings; they may apply one tagset to one text, or
to multiple texts, or they may apply multiple tagsets to one text,
or multiple texts; any element they create can reference any
other element created by themselves or by someone else. Thus
the resource’s encoding becomes multivalent in part and in
whole.
A cluster of activities defines the space of distributed
multivalent encoding, including annotation, keywording
(including “folksonomizing”), editing, and humanities criticism.
For any one component of DME anticipatory previous work
exists.1 Any newness of DME lies only in the surprising fact
that the components have never been fully assembled, though
they have all been present for some years. Now, however, we
can see DME emerging, albeit in hesitant, not-fully-developed
forms.2
A DME resource has a base text (or texts), a web interface for
creating encoding, and a mechanism for storing encoding; these
three things enable all subsequent activities: editing, deleting,
retrieving, searching, etc. Considering each of the three parts
in a little more detail we will see few real technical obstacles
in DME’s path.
Distributed multivalent encoding starts with a reference base
digital text. A reference base text should be clearly marked as
such by the resource managers. Only they may change it (or
give someone else permission to change it), and any change
must be well publicized. A reference base text must have a
well-defined beginning and end, and a well-defined internal
base reference structure. While it is certainly possible to regard
either the simple byte sequence or the character sequence as
the base reference structure and then link encodings to byte or
character offsets, this is not a robust solution. Practicality
suggests the internal base reference structure should itself be
an encoding; convenience and practicality further suggest a

Page 30

Digital Humanities 2007
presentation-based encoding, on the grounds that presentation
in a medium reflects a community’s sense of that medium’s
main communicative organization and delivery units (Caton,
2001). A TEI Lite encoding (<http://www.tei-c.org/
Guidelines2/index.xml.ID=lite>), for example, or
one conforming to DLF Level 4 (<http://www.diglib.
org/standards/tei.htm#level4>), would be suitable.
We should stress, though, that the reference structure makes
no claim to being representationally definitive. Within the
structure, distinctions between tags and #PCDATA are purely
structural and do not define either “text” (as general
phenomenon) or “the text”. A supplementary encoding – ie. an
encoding created by a user – associates with the text as
represented within the reference structure, not “the text” as
some reified cultural object. If we follow the reasoning of
Renear et al on the relationship between FRBR entities and
XML documents, we would probably consider the base
reference text a manifestation of an expression, especially
because we incline towards a presentation-based encoding
(which, as Caton argues, is what OHCO-style encoding
is)(Renear et al, 2004, Caton 2001). The FRBR vocabulary,
however, hardly resolves the problematic semantics of the
common phrases “the text” and “a text”. Hence our insistence
on treating the internal reference structure as definitive only
within the DME resource as a system. Indeed the very point of
a DME resource is to allow users to create encodings that they
can treat as definitive for their purposes.
The web interface presents the base text to the user and allows
the user to associate encoding(s) with parts of the text. The
encoding must allow for multiple overlapping hierarchies, and
so a format such as CLIX/TEI HORSE should be used (DeRose,
2004, Bauman, 2005). While the interface programming might
be complex in terms of having to manage numerous details,
the required functionality is straightforward. The actual
mechanics a resource employs are not important, except as
regards the degree to which they make the process awkward.
They will vary according to programmers’ preferences and with
changes in technology. The proof-of-concept Limner interface,
for example, uses HORSE and relies on explicit element IDs
and user-selected strings to mark where start and end tags go.
DeRose notes that ‘[o]ne often hears that … IDs are somehow
"safe" pointers into documents (DeRose, 2004). However, this
is not true; they are at most “safer” than many other methods.’
His point is well taken. However, there must be some reference
system, and unless we resign ourselves to inline markup and
unwieldy file sizes, it seems preferable to keep the
supplementary markup separate from the base text and use a
system that is (to view the cup as half full rather than half
empty) at least safer than many other methods. A combination
of full XPath plus element ID plus a string of sufficient length
to have a strong chance of being unique should allow a DME
resource to consistently associate a stored out-of-line element
with its proper position with respect to the internal base

reference system. The Limner implementation is rather crude
and already dated; the DOM scripting features of current
browsers together with wider availability of XPath handling
functions in programming languages offer many opportunities
to improve upon it.
The actual details of storage are also of limited importance.
Relational databases can hold the information (as with Limner)
but it seems likely that future DME resources will use native
XML databases.
Without downplaying the amount of work involved, we can
confidently say that DME is perfectly possible with current
technology and that DME resources will be built in the near
future. The real unknowns (and potential problems) lie on the
social side. Who gets to encode? Will all supplementary
encodings be equal, or will some be “more equal” than others?
Will encodings be moderated? Will differently encoded and
competing base reference texts proliferate until the very notion
of a base reference becomes utterly compromised? Will a class
system of resources emerge, driven by a scholarly fear of
non-scholars’ contributions? The relative success of Wikipedia
in the face of all the things that could have stopped it should
make us optimistic. Probably DME will initially develop in
constrained forms, with resources authorizing users and
retaining ultimate editorial control over supplementary
encodings. In time we hope to see distributed multivalent
encoding become a widespread, democratic practice

1. For example, the resource based around Pico Della Mirandola’s
Conclusiones CM publicae disputandae (PICO) features an
annotation system which is also employed by the Virtual
Humanities Lab (VHL), a resource whose development plan
includes implementing a form of DME.
2. See LIMNER, for example: a site intended as a proof-of-concept
DME resource, still in an early stage.

T

he National Panel Report released by the Association of
American Colleges and Universities (2002), calls for a
“dramatic reorganization of undergraduate education” to address
the challenges faced by higher education in a time of
transformation from an industrial to a knowledge-based society
(vii). The report states that “education practices invented when
education served only the few are increasingly disconnected
from the needs of contemporary students”(viii) and the demands
of citizens of a diverse and interconnected world.
The Report recommends an invigorated and practical liberal
education offering knowledge that all students, regardless of
backgrounds, fields, or chosen higher education institutions,
should acquire. The college student of the twenty-first century
needs to become an “intentional learner” who can thrive in a
complex world, and who can adapt to new environments,
integrate knowledge from different sources, and transform
information into knowledge and knowledge into judgment and
action (xi.). The Report urges an “end to the traditional, artificial
distinctions between liberal and practical education” and
advocates a kind of instruction and learning that looks beyond
the classroom to the world’s major questions” (xii).
The changing nature of colleges and universities and the
reconstruction of education it calls for is in great part
conditioned by what Douglas Kellner calls the “Great
Transformation,” powered by one of the most dramatic
technological revolutions in history (2003, 51). The revisioning
of higher education is increasingly seen in correlation with the
development of digital technologies, which are changing not
only traditional models of work, leisure and communication,
but also the nature of knowledge itself, as well as models of
acquiring and processing information cognitively. In the Report
it is asserted that the “intellectual and practical skills that
students need are extensive, sophisticated and expanding with
the explosion of new technologies” (xi). Like the AACU Report,
Kellner too argues that traditional and specialized aspects of
education need to be overcome in order to develop alternative
pedagogies and multiple “literacies” to meet the challenges of
an interconnected global society. The study of interrelationships,
connectivity, transfer, and integration, leading to the
development of critical judgment, is proposed as the basis of
the new liberal curriculum in all disciplines of the humanities.

Page 32

Digital Humanities 2007
The five key concepts for the new curriculum are in fact not so
much concepts as they are markers of cognitive processes. As
such, the reform of higher education is to take place primarily
in terms of methodology of teaching. Given that “hypertext is
a mental process, as well as a digital tool” (Gilster, 137), and
the WWW is “an embodiment of human knowledge”(W3C),
exploring the relationships between cognition and technology
in the context of the new humanities and pedagogy can be
useful. I would like to suggest that the digital media offer a
useful concrete, but also a cognitive tool for teaching the five
processes that are to be the core of the new humanities. This
claim has theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically,
it calls for becoming more aware how the computer is altering
our ways of engaging with specific disciplinary questions
cognitively and methodologically (McCarty, 1). My concerns
in this paper, however, have to do with the practical applications
of the impact of digital media on cognition within the area of
the humanities. Practically, the claim calls for explicit
instruction within the context of each discipline in the methods
of organization and manipulability that underlie the presentation
of material on the WWW.
The main vehicle of the digital media, the WWW, in its nature
embodies, illustrates and enables through its functioning all
four of the processes suggested as the basis for the new liberal
curriculum--interrelationships, connectivity, transfer, and
integration. By their very nature “the new media technologies
externalize and objectify reasoning” (Manovich, 59). The
WWW resists attempts at standard systematization, and
demonstrates the co-existence of and interrelationships between
multiple and apparently contradictory perspectives on a single
issue. One GOOGLE keyword search will retrieve hundreds
of documents linked by one single term, but applied variously
in different contexts, emphasizing the importance and nature
of connectivity, transfer and integration.
In relation to a given subject of inquiry or task, the non-linearity
in the presentation of material and ideas on the WWW
encourages “intentional” involvement on the part of learners,
as there is no longer one “solution” or a single “interpretation,”
but a variety, all situated within their own context and
knowledge. In order to find solutions to given questions or
problems, learners have to engage in a process of discovering
connections among apparently disparate materials and contexts,
then find ways of transferring and integrating parts of materials
into a new context. The WWW also offers alternative models
of grouping materials, such as scaffolding, and it promotes the
idea that conceptual knowledge cannot be separated from the
contexts in which it is represented (Wiles and Littlejohn, 2003;
Campbell, 2004; Cole, 2000; Carr, 1998;). The ready
availability of various information on the WWW turns research
and interpretation not so much into an exercise that depends
upon finding information, but one that strongly emphasizes
cognitive operations depending on critical thinking:

classification of it (finding meaningful interrelationships) and
making use of it (transferring it) by arranging it meaningfully
in a give context (integrating it). Scholarship and instruction
in the humanities has always relied on these processes; however,
with computer connectivity and the speed with which these
processes happen, the WWW amplifies them, enables them
“physically” and “on-demand” and thus makes them more
explicitly and self-consciously “teachable” than before.
In addition, because the WWW offers multiple presentations
of information, it illustrates that knowledge and heuristics are
not absolute, but situated within various communities of
knowing. Conceptually there is no “closure” or “ending” online,
but rather a constant process of evaluation of materials (Rhodes
and Sawday, 12) that are open to revisions, additions and
remodeling. Becoming aware of the implications the nature of
the WWW has for understanding what constitutes knowledge,
argument, opinion, analysis and interpretation, leads to the
development of critical discernment, evaluative capacity and
judgment.
While traditional “mass education tended to see life in a linear
fashion based on print models and developed pedagogies which
broke experience into discrete moments and behavioral bits,”
a new critical pedagogy of the digital humanities could produce
skills that “enable individuals to better navigate the multiple
realm and challenges of contemporary life” (Kellner, 9). Making
the WWW, its capabilities and operating functions explicit
models of intentional learning can help educators in the digital
humanities illustrate how knowledge in the humanities is
positively affected by the digital medium, and how the new
pedagogy leads to learning as an active, social process bound
up with experience connected with wider socio-political
paradigms of change.

his paper will focus on the use of technologies
traditionally associated with knowledge management and
ontological representation to express complex associations
between entities in historical texts that have been marked up
in XML according to the Text Encoding Initiative guidelines.1
In particular, we will describe our exploration of the potential
use of RDF (Resource Description Framework)/OWL (Web
Ontology Language) technologies and will reflect on the role
of an ontology in facilitating the interpretation of implicit and
hidden associations in the sources, examining its use and limits
in a digital humanities project in connection with editing tools
and delivery issues.
We will demonstrate our findings based on the Henry III Fine
Rolls project,2 where an RDF ontology is being developed to
make explicit information about person, place and subject
entities marked up as “instances” in the core texts themselves.

he Henry III Fine Rolls is a three-year collaborative
project between King's College London and the National

Digital Humanities 2007
Archives (UK) that aims to represent the complexity of a
historical object known as the 'fine rolls' which chart offers of
money made to King Henry III of England in exchange for a
wide range of concessions and favours. A total of 64 rolls
containing around 800 parchment membranes, one for almost
all of the fifty-six years of Henry III’s reign from 1216-72,
survive in the UK National Archives.3 Each fine roll was
compiled in Latin by a handful of scribes and taken as a body
of documentary evidence, the rolls are of “prime importance
in the study of political, social, and economic history and of
government and administration at a local and national level.”4
The project will cover the first thirty-two years of Henry III’s
reign down to 1248 and will result in both print and digital
editions of the rolls, using as a model the format of the
traditional printed 'calendar' (an English summary of records,
plus a set of indices) in connection with the digitised images
of the rolls themselves. The digital edition will have a
sophisticated search interface and both print and digital editions
will provide a series of indices for people, places and subjects
that include complex associations between the various entries.
The core texts were encoded in XML using the TEI guidelines
and include mark-up related to some aspects of the physical
structure of the rolls as material artefacts.5 Particular attention
has been given in the mark-up to the occurrences of names of
persons, places and institutions. Furthermore, the project
researchers have identified and marked-up relevant subjects in
the fine rolls. Therefore, while the general mark-up in TEI XML
provides a framework for theoretical analysis and practical
encoding of the text of the calendar as it is being edited and
summarised in English, the need for additional modelling has
emerged so as to:
•

•

associate textual instances of the same person, subject
occurrence or place to their correspondent logical authority
—whether that be a person (identified or anonymous), a
subject class or a place;
express the mutual relationships between the relevant
authorities (e.g. individuals, locations, institutions and
subjects).

Why RDF/OWL?

I

n previous work on projects requiring an expression of the
associations between sources in core texts marked up using
TEI XML we have taken more traditional approaches using
XML structures or relational databases to solve the problem,
but have increasingly found these wanting. There has been
some research in the TEI community in this area lately,
particularly around 'biographical and prosopographical data'6,
but at the time of writing this was not mature enough for us to
make a commitment to using it and in any case our attention

was drawn to other standards whose main objectives are closer
to what we are trying to achieve.
After conducting a comparative evaluation of possible standards
to create authority lists structures that included research into
RDF/OWL, Topic Maps and MADS (Metadata Authority
Description Schema), we opted for RDF/OWL.
The main reasons for this choice were the following:7
•

•

RDF/OWL models provide a logical organisation of data
together with the possibility of a flexible manipulation of
meanings (e.g. rich expression of relationships among
objects/entities mentioned in the source text, where an
object/entity might be a person, a place or a subject);
RDF/OWL decreases ambiguity by identifying unique
entities independently from their instances in a decentralised
way.

While the more practical advantages are that:
•

•
•

as a set of standards which are at the heart of the Semantic
Web, RDF/OWL is internationally recognised and supported
- its models could facilitate the interconnection between
humanities computing projects in general and between
directly related data in particular;
there is a relatively good selection of tools for RDF/OWL
compared to the other technologies that we have explored;
RDF/OWL can be expressed in XML format, thus allowing
the re-purposing of data for web delivery (e.g. creation of
indices through the use of XSLT).

Ontology: Structure, Tool and
Delivery

T

he RDF schema and OWL are used to define the
knowledge domain around the core materials on the
project (the fine rolls) using classes and predicates. Already
existing predicates are used as extensively as possible (e.g.
CIDOC-CRM, Dublin Core, Friend of a Friend, Simple
Knowledge Organization System).
The connection between the TEI source files and the ontology
play an important role in our model.8 Indeed the XML files not
only feed the ontology with some data (e.g. variants of a certain
person name), but they are themselves part of the ontological
model. The fact that they exhibit names and assert facts related
to those names can be modelled in the ontology together with
the statement that a person name (proper name or in general
reference string) is associated to a specific person as an instance
of the entity person (e.g. that has a gender, a possible status
etc.). Quoting Eide,9 we include “explicit statements of the
sources of the assertions exhibited in the text”:
Page 35

Digital Humanities 2007
•

the facility to browse information alphabetically or
categorised in some way (e.g. by date, county, role, kind of
relation) and to search for particular associations as
expressed in the ontology (e.g. all the locations connected
to the person called 'Robert Arsic' or all the relatives of
Robert Arsic).

Conclusions

I

n the case of the fine rolls (as is true of many projects
involving complex primary sources) it is not enough to
mark-up an occurrence of a person name if you wish to create
complex indices or to create structured search functions.
Moreover, an authority-based approach is essential in order to
make the resource interoperable; external authority lists are
needed to record information in a systematic, comprehensive
and possibly standardised way, so as to:
•

store additional information related to persons, places and
subject (exhibited and marked up as corresponding instances
in the TEI XML files);
make explicit the multiple connections between places,
persons and subjects;
merge or disambiguate identifications and eventually correct
the original mark-up of the rolls.

The concrete connection between the XML files and the
ontology is maintained through the use of identifiers, as in the
example below:
<persName key="arsic_robert"> Robert Arsic
</persName>
→
<frh3:Man
rdf:ID="arsic_robert"> … </frh3:Man>

•

Evidently, the value and granularity of the ontology depends
on various factors, which include the richness of the source
files themselves (e.g. how well do the fine rolls express the
reality of the roles/occupations in the thirteenth century?), the
specific interests of the researchers (e.g. in the types of fines
rather than in the amount of money they keep record of) and
the definability of the knowledge domain itself (as shown in
the contrast between the identification of individuals and the
much more blurred identification of subjects).

Our paper will describe how, for the Henry III Fine Rolls
project, an RDF/OWL ontology was used to model complex
associations and how this has assisted the project researchers
in the interpretation of the material they are editing and
facilitated the production of a digital resource that will allow
future users to browse the material under different perspectives,
to explore the relationships among mentioned individuals,
locations and subjects, and to foster new understandings.

In addition to expressing complex associations in an abstract
intellectual sense, it was also crucial to the project to create a
system endowed with sophisticated facilities for editing and
final publication. We will describe our experience in creating
such tools, in particular taking into account such project
requirements as:
•

•

the facilities for managing/editing data: the addition of new
information, new classes/predicates/literal values; the
definition of relationships between entries, the possibility
to merge instances of classes or subclasses (e.g. while
editing we may realise that person A and B are actually the
same);
the connection and synchronisation between the ontology
structure and data on the one hand, and the TEI source files
on the other (e.g. links from classes in authority list to actual
references to those classes as exhibited in the mark-up);

ith The Making of Americans1, Stein’s goal was to
record “being” as it is manifested in repetition. Lauded
by some critics who thought Stein accomplished what T.S. Eliot
demanded of all writers—to make art, literature, and language
“new”—she was also criticized by others like Malcolm Cowley
who said Stein’s “experiments in grammar” made her novel
“one of the hardest books to read from beginning to end that
has ever been published.”2 More recent critics have attempted
to aid interpretation by charting the correspondence between
structures of repetition and the novel’s discussion of identity

and representation. Yet, the use of repetition in The Making of
Americans is far more complicated than manual practices or
traditional word-analysis programs (such as those that make
concordances or measure word-frequency occurrence) could
indicate. The text’s large size (almost 900 pages and 3183
paragraphs), its particular philosophical trajectory, and its
complex patterns of repetition make it a useful case study for
analyzing the interplay between the development of text mining
tools and the hermeneutics employed in interpreting literary
texts in general.
The reason that text mining procedures might be particularly
illuminating for Stein’s The Making of Americans is not that
these procedures make reading the text easier or because text
mining might “solve” a literary conundrum. In fact, such a
reductive approach would be very uninteresting to the literary
scholar. Many Stein critics argue that the “difficulty” the
repetition engenders in The Making of Americans is valuable
precisely because it is rooted in indeterminacy: that is, the text’s
use of repetition represents a postmodernist project that
challenges readerly subjectivity and deconstructs the role
language and the process of writing plays in determining
meaning. The more “difficult” the text is to read, the more it
meets its philosophical goals of making the reader question
acts of representation and interpretation in general. Thus the
text mining process is useful for literary analysis for three
reasons:
1. Text mining may be used to determine relationships (clusters
and patterns) in large bodies of data (in this case, the
confusing network of Stein’s repetitions ).
2. Text mining can be used to identify relationships within the
text that are not predetermined by meaning but are based
on structural elements of the content (such as repetitive
phrases or words).
3. Text mining also requires “subjective human evaluation”
as an essential part of the analytical process.3
Analyzing The Making of Americans has already provided rich
opportunities for thinking about both tool development and
processes of literary analysis. For example, initial analyses on
the text using the Data to Knowledge (D2K) application
environment for data mining4 (which was used in the nora
project5) has yielded clusters based on the existence of frequent
patterns. Instead of using single words for analyzing the text,
the features used were phrases (i.e. ngrams). Executing a
frequent pattern analysis algorithm6 produced a list of patterns
of the phrases co-occurring frequently in paragraphs. This
frequent pattern analysis generated thousands of patterns
because slight variations generated a new pattern. Because the
number of frequent patterns was so large, another algorithm
was applied that clustered these frequent patterns.7Although
the analytics that were used are sophisticated, the results are
not presented in a manner that makes them easy for scholars

Digital Humanities 2007
to understand. For example, one cluster has 85 frequent patterns
(see Figure 1). A scholar could piece clustered phrases back
together to form a longer repetitive phrase (“part of Gossols
where no other rich people were living”), but this is difficult,
and, in addition, the results do not indicate where the phrase
occurs in the document. The impact of Stein’s repetition, after
all, is always contingent on context, on what comes before and
after a particular string of letters, on what those strings (or
words) mean in the context of a sentence, a paragraph, and the
larger narrative or project according both to Stein and to the
scholar/user’s theoretical perspective.
Thus, this first attempt at producing clusters was only
marginally useful for scholarly study because the rules by which
the items are clustered are not readily apparent and the results
are detached from the context of the text. One method for
helping scholars understand the rules is by including the scholar
in identifying the features by which the frequent patterns are
determined. For instance, she could develop a “productive”
question about the text, a question that correlates to specific
linguistic and narrative features that can be extracted and
eventually mined. For example, a question might be: how do
linguistic and syntactic variations reflect, advance, or deter
from the progression of the text’s more abstract features such
as argument and narrative? Specifically, do changes in repetition
correspond to the novel’s evolving theories about identity and
representation? And how? Features which might be considered
include, but are not limited to, repetition across words and
phrases (including “trivial” and “motivated” recurrences);8
grammatical features (such as shifting perspectives, oscillating
verb-tenses, or dropped pronoun referents); syntactic features
(such as diagrammic versus run-on or fragmented sentences);
and narrative features (such as shifts between description or
“telling” and narrative or “showing”). More work needs to be
done to create the features described above for use in the
analytics. This paper will discuss our attempts to augment these
analyses.
In addition, in order to link these patterns back to the context,
it is essential to develop an environment that facilitates a
self-reflective, critical evaluation of the scholar’s theoretical
perspective and ultimately, her ability to influence how data is
culled, to assert what Ben Shneiderman has called “user
control.” Thus, the text’s features must be visualized in a
meaningful way so the scholar can “see” the text mining results
and engage with the techniques to improve the results. For
instance, in our first attempt, we created frequent patterns
without using stemming. After reviewing the list of results, we
realized that stemming was valuable to regulate pluralism, verb
tense, etc. Stemming was deployed. Our experience with the
norainterface has also demonstrated that providing easy access
to context within the text is important to understanding the
results of classification algorithms—a task which is relatively
easy when the entire text is a short poem (see Figure 2). A

scholar who is attempting to study repetition across the
900-page text, however, needs new ways to access the context
of each instance of repetition. She needs tools that take her
beyond searching tools which list the context of a single line
(see Figure 3 for results using “grep” on a file). To this end,
we have explored various visualization methods such as a
weighted centroid (Figure 4), a scatterplot (Figure 5), a heat
map (Figure 6), and a line graph (Figure 7).After our team
considered the advantages and disadvantages of each of these
tools, Anthony Don led the effort to design FeatureLens (Figure
8), a tool which allows the user to see features derived from
text mining results within the context of the original text. This
tool will serve as the main focus of this talk.
Ben Shneiderman calls the powerful combination of text mining
and visualization, “discovery” based because it empowers users
“to specify what they are seeking and what they find
interesting.”9 Gertrude Stein has this to say about the same
topic:
It is very likely that nearly every one has been very nearly certain
that something that is interesting is interesting them . . . The only
thing that is different from one time to another is what is seen and
what is seen depends upon how everybody is doing everything.
This makes the thing we are looking at very different and this
makes what those describe it make of it, it makes a composition,
it confuses, it shows, it is, it looks, it likes it as it is, and this makes
what is seen as it is seen.10

Text mining allows the literary scholar to “see” the text
“differently” by facilitating analytical approaches that chart
repetition across thousands of paragraphs and visualizations
that empower her to tweak the results, focus her search, and
ultimately (re)discover “something that is interesting.” This
paper will discuss how this process of analyzing repetition in
The Making of Americans has impacted the ways in which nora
has combined text mining and visualization applications.

in the outer ring; the green lines represent lines in which the word appears;
and the orange lines point to word's occurrence in those lines. ()

somewhere in the middle.2 It is not just a word search engine.
Rather, it uses an abstract representation of document structure,
shredding the XML into sets of related database tables. This
means that PhiloLogic can process TEI-XML or a variety of
other document encoding schemes by extracting structural
information from available text tagging. Storing both
bibliographic data and object-level data in SQL tables,
PhiloLogic can search document structure and refine word
searching by using the shredded XML.
In the first part of our presentation, we will explain how
PhiloLogic stores object-level data in MySQL for flexible and
speedy results retrieval. PhiloLogic extracts metadata at various
object depths from full-text documents and outputs that data
into flat files. Called dividx.raw and subdividx.raw, these flat
files contain object-level addresses and attributes of those
objects. These flat files can be loaded into MySQL either
manually, after PhiloLogic indexing finishes, or automatically,
using the generated SQL scripts, load.database.sql and
load.subdoctables.sql. When the user then executes a div-level
search, the PhiloLogic search engine queries these tables,
refining search results dynamically.
The user can thus limit searches to individual speakers, speaker
genders, or other meta-characteristics, within a corpus of plays,
a selection of acts, or even within scenes in individual works.
Here is an example of dividx.raw from a database of plays:

his presentation will demonstrate how PhiloLogic 31 uses
a mixed processing mode to leverage both the efficiency
of relational databases and the richness of TEI-XML encoding.
We will discuss the specific scripting and database techniques
used to enable fast execution of object level searches on large
collections of electronic texts. We will also show how this
stand-off model can be extended to allow for more complex
nested object and word searching.

T

The first field contains the document id and the object-level
separated by a colon. Here, counting up from zero, this is the
first subobject in the sixth text. The second field contains the
object header. The third denotes what kind of object it is, as
specified in the type attribute of the div tag. The last field
contains the document id again. The file subdividx contains
data about lower level objects, such as individual speakers'
speeches:

By way of background and context, PhiloLogic is a full-text
search, analysis, and retrieval tool developed by the ARTFL
Project and the Digital Library Development Center at the
University of Chicago. The main purpose of PhiloLogic is to
run word searches on large corpora of literary texts and to
display results quickly. The system supports full boolean and
proximity searches and provides a number of reporting
functions, including KWICs, collocation tables and a variety
of word frequency breakdowns. To achieve the required speed,
PhiloLogic pre-indexes each word, storing byte offsets in a flat
file. PhiloLogic handles document structure, currently extending
down to seven levels of depth, in a similar manner, abstracting
a structure by assigning numbers to each nested object-level of
each document. Thus, on the general continuum of database
systems, from pure (or native) XML systems like eXist to
traditional SQL systems like MySQL, PhiloLogic falls

Once again, the first field contains the specific address of the
object. The second field denotes that the object is a speaker tag.
The rest of the fields contain metadata about the specific
character. These stand-off tables allow the user to delimit word
searches by speaker and speaker characteristics.
When applied to digitized dictionaries, this functionality allows
the user to restrict searching to headwords, as opposed to article

The first field, of course, is the object address for the headword.
The following fields contain the headword in both romanized
and UTF-8 formats.
In the second part of the presentation, we will show how
PhiloLogic can be modified to talk to standoff concordance
tables, not loaded into MySQL, that enable the user to search
for alternate and variant forms of words. The indexing engine
creates a flat, single-field concordance file, called words.R,
containing the surface forms of every word in a database. After
the load, the database administrator can run a simple script on
this file to convert it into a multi-field table, called
words.R.wom. By making a few standard edits to the word
exploder, crapser, searches can be executed for simplified,
lemmatized, or transliterated forms of each word. To cite an
example from a collection of classical Greek texts, the
words.R.wom file has fields that contain a non-accented Greek
form of the word, the original form, and a romanized form:

Any of these forms can be entered into the keyword search field
to find the original, indexed word. On the search page, the user
clicks a radio button to indicate which form she is entering.
This selection triggers a subroutine in the word exploder that
finds the entered form in words.R.wom, finally passing the
indexed form to the search engine.
The extensions discussed above have been fully implemented
to address the needs of particular projects. Looking forward,
we have begun work on a new extension to the core PhiloLogic
system to support several text mining tasks in conjunction with
the standard full-text analysis capabilties. This effort, currently
named "Philomine,"3 will allow users to do perform text mining
tasks on user selected subsets of a PhiloLogic database,
facilitating comparative analyses of stylistic and content features
at the document level. The first stage will use a set of freely
avilable Perl modules, including SVMLight, naive-Bayesian,
and decision tree modules. This will give the user a choice of
algorithms when running data mining experiments. Result sets
will be linked to the search functions of PhiloLogic, allowing
for rapid inspection of text mining results. We hope that
PhiloLogic extensions, coupled with these widely tested
machine learning tools, will allow humanists to bring a new
level of computational rigor to textual analysis and to broaden
its scope, revealing differences and similarities across large
textual corpora.

The Anthropology of Knowledge:
From Basic to Complex Virtual
Communities in the Arts and
Humanities
Stuart Dunn (stuart.dunn@kcl.ac.uk)
King's College London
Tobias Blanke (tobias.blanke@kcl.ac.uk)
King's College London
An online community may be defined very simply as any group
of people who collaborate regularly and/or formally using
internet technologies. Such communities are becoming
increasingly important in arts and humanities research. They
include blogs, wikis, mailing lists and other such fora. The
Jiscmail and Listserv services (<http://www.jiscmail
.ac.uk; http://www.lsoft.com>), and the availability
of well-known open source wiki and blog software (e.g. <ht
tp://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki> and
<http://twiki.org>) have made it so easy to establish
online communities that most projects in the digital and
humanities now have one of some kind or another. However
such fora are founded on relatively basic technologies. The
various arts and humanities e-science and cyberinfrastructure
programmes underway in many countries offer huge
opportunities to enable online communities in ways that go far
beyond what is generally available now. These approaches will
be based on incomparably more complex tools, methods and
technologies such as Virtual Organizations (VOs), Virtual
Research Environments (see <http://www.ahessc.ac.
uk/briefing-paper>) collaborative virtual workspaces,
and Semantic Web. If these tools, methods and technologies
are to be exploited by practice-led arts researchers and
humanists to the greatest effect, they will need to be grounded
in a strategic, rigorous and systematic understanding of the
behaviours of current online communities, as complex online
systems will clearly evolve from collaboration tools currently
in use. The proposed paper will offer an overview of current
usage of various online fora, and propose a high-level mapping
from that overview onto the capabilities of the e-science-based
collaborative systems of the future, such as MyVocs (<http
://www.myvocs.org/>).
Of immediate importance to the humanities are VREs, as they
help geographically dispersed research groups to come together
in virtual laboratories that allow modelling and experimentation
as much as discussion of research results. The e-Science concept
Page 44

of a Virtual Organisation on the other hand is seen as a set of
institutions and/or individuals defined by resource sharing
policies. 1 A VO is a community with the will to share resources
and information across the internet, while VREs enable VOs
by adding tools and methods that help the community to work
together and share resources in a secure manner. VREs attempt
to bring together researchers across disciplines and
administrative boundaries. Many argue that humanities
computing in general constitutes such an attempt, where the
‘glue’ is to find ‘methodological commons’2 to present the
disciplinary kinships among different disciplines in the
humanities and in computing. A hi-tech VRE for arts and
humanities computing could therefore make these computational
methods the subject of online discussions enabled by advanced
information discovery technologies. As a case study, this paper
will report on our efforts to set up such a VRE.
The Arts and Humanities e-Science Support Centre (AHESSC)
is in regular and direct contact with many online communities,
and is in an excellent position to offer an overview. We will
present findings from detailed research on the recent history of
a range of existing discussion fora. These will include both
moderated and unmoderated groups critically and qualitatively
assessing the difference this makes, and extrapolate an agenda
for the management systems needed for VREs. We will examine
both direct and indirect links between messages, semantic
commonalities, disciplinary vocabularies and threading patterns,
and hyperlinking behaviour. We will also examine other
well-established wiki and blog communities of relevance to the
humanities in much the same way. The paper will draw out
commonalities, identify points of conflict and the reasons
underlying them, the implementation and practice of
“netiquette’ codes, and the importance of sustaining archives
and maintaining access to them. We argue that regardless of
the technology, these are essential questions if the adoption of
advanced collaborative tools is to be a success. A key remit of
AHeSSC itself is to help develop a community of e-science
‘early adopters’, and the research presented forms a central part
of this mission. We believe that more complex collaborative
technologies will not only enable the transmission of
‘traditional’ scholarly communication in the form of text and
images as in the current basic systems; but also they will
facilitate access to large scale, complex and fuzzy data, and
allow scholars to work together in real time with that data. For
example, instead of sending a complex dataset as an email
attachment to a group whose members then manipulate it
according to their expertise and locally available software, and
then send it back to the originator, the new architectures will
allow two or (many) more to work on it in real time, to discuss
it, expose it to analytical tools, and to annotate it online, whilst
preserving a complete record of the workflow. We will show
how close critical analysis of the existing lo-tech systems should
inform the design of such architectures.

Digital Humanities 2007
This will be illustrated by considering a VRE for arts and
humanities computing methodologies for which funding is
currently being sought. This project will continue the
community building efforts of the UK’s AHRC ICT Methods
Network (see <http://www.methodsnetwork.ac.u
k>), with a taxonomy of computational methods developed by
the Arts and Humanities Data Service (see <http://ahds
.ac.uk/about/projects/documents/pmdb_taxo
nomy_v1_3_1.pdf>). This is seen as a first step to build a
semantically enriched VRE, using the taxonomy as the
foundation of an ontology. The taxonomy will be verified
against papers from online databases or websites presenting
tools and methods. Ontological approaches are used that allow
not only the semantic integration of different text and
multimedia resources, but also the tracking of exchanged
arguments that help users better understand decisions about
methodologies. Our paper will illustrate the evolutionary
relationship between an advanced environment such as this,
and the basic environments with which we are all familiar.

unding agencies such as NEH and AHRC have clearly
stated that the open source approach to digital humanities
work is necessary for both short-term financial support of
projects and long-term success of digital humanities work.
However, both agencies have predominantly emphasized the
creation of open source projects rather than asking scholars to
consider the possibilities offered when projects tap into the use
of externally produced open source software. Even less
emphasis has been placed on how academic projects might
structure projects to invite participation from the open source
development community.
There are excellent examples of groups that have modeled the
importance of open source methodologies in Digital Humanities
including the TEI/XML movement to standardize an XML
appropriate to humanities projects and NINES, currently
developing open source tools for use by the broader community.
Less common, however, is the exploration of how we might
engage the developer community with our work. Examples
abound in the larger technology framework. BBC’s Backstage
movement has created a model that asks a free developer
community to produce vast numbers of prototypes based on
existing RSS feeds and open source software. This movement
provides a possible model and possible interfaces that could
benefit digital humanities work. OSCON (Open Source
Convention) offers another possible model. While academics
struggle to find the appropriate tools for digital humanities and
appropriate standardization practices within the context of
academic restraints (budget and promotion issues in particular),
we might consider how to engage the broader open source

developer community and how to rewrite and use open source
software for our digital humanities projects.

textual databases quickly became an active interdisciplinary
research field known as “text mining”.

This panel will explore various approaches to engaging with
open source software and development. As is fitting for a panel
that looks to engage a non-academic audience in the
development of our projects, we have put together three papers
from diverse contributors: a linguist interested in the use of
open source software for text mining; a literary scholar
interested in testing open source programs such as Ruby on
Rails and Google maps, in a digital archive; and a computer
programmer who has actively worked with the open source
development community, and OSCON in particular, over the
past 10 years. The panel participants will discuss the use of
particular pieces of software, benefits and limitations of such
approaches, ways to open digital humanities work to a broader
development community, and how to engage the open source
development community in our work.

Although some more or less efficient commercial text mining
software is becoming available, these tools suffer from two
main problems in an academic research context. First,
commercial text mining suites are very expensive and therefore
have not been fully integrated in academic practices. Secondly,
and more importantly, these suites have been conceived in order
to mainly assist business-related text mining tasks. They are
not adapted to the variety and specificity of humanities
academic research. Nevertheless, very recent academic projects
have started to explore the potential of text mining techniques
applied to large humanities and social sciences corpora. These
research initiatives are mainly based on open-source text mining
modules.

Text Mining and Computer-Assisted Thematic
Analysis: Using Open-Source Software to Discover
Knowledge from Unstructured Documents
Dominic Forest
During the last decades, many humanities research initiatives
have been concentrating their efforts on digitalizing large
amounts of text (British National Corpus, Brown corpus,
Gallica project, Oxford Text Archive, etc.). Simultaneously,
technologies were developed for more accurate and faster
digitalization processes, and for more flexible and robust digital
document encoding (XML), storing and retrieval. In the last
years, some results of these digitalization initiatives have been
made available on various supports and in many digital formats.
Digitalization initiatives partly motivated the need for robust
large-scale text analysis software.
The development of text analysis tools has been influenced
(and has often integrated) concepts and techniques from many
academic fields. Among the main disciplines involved in the
conception and development of text analysis software, we find
linguistics (natural language processing), information science,
and computer science. However, in the last years important
research developments in the general field of text analysis
emerged from the areas of data analysis, artificial intelligence
and machine learning. Initially, the concepts and techniques
developed in these areas where mostly applied on numerical
data. This led to a rapidly growing research area known as “data
mining”. The primary objective of data mining tools is to rapidly
extract valuable (and previously unknown) information from
large sets of quantitative data. Many researchers, mostly familiar
with the information retrieval community, saw the potential of
this emerging technology in the domain of text analysis. The
application of data mining concepts and techniques on large
Page 46

The objectives of our talk are 1) to report an experiment in
which we use open- source text mining tools to assist thematic
analysis from unstructured texts and 2) identify the benefits
and limits of using open-source text mining tools in the context
of text analysis tasks in the humanities.
Our talk will be divided in three main parts. In the first part,
we will present the fundamental concepts and techniques of
text mining. More specifically, we will present how two
fundamental knowledge discovery processes (text clustering
and text categorization) can be assisted – and in some cases
accomplished automatically – using state-of-the-art text mining
techniques.
The second part will be dedicated to the presentation of a
specific text mining methodology to assist thematic analysis
of unstructured documents. This methodology is composed of
four main steps: 1) text pre-processing, 2) text transformation
using vector-space model, 3) knowledge discovery (using
clustering or categorisation processes), and 4) thematic analysis.
In this part, we will present each step in details and we will
present open-source text mining tools that can accomplish each
process.
In the third part, we will report the main results obtained using
this four-step methodology on a Belgian newspaper corpus.
In conclusion, based on experiments using open-source text
mining technology, we will identify and discuss some benefits
and limits of open-source text mining tools in the context of
humanities text analysis.

An Open-Source Approach to Digital Humanities:
Testing the Limits of Open Source Ideology in the
19th-Century Concord Digital Archive
Amy Earhart
The 19th-Century Concord Digital Archive collaborators are
exploring the utilization of a wide variety of open source tools
in archive construction as well as following a distribution
method that will encourage the participation of an open source
development community. As the 19th-Century Concord Digital
Archive nears beta test (Summer 2007), it seems an appropriate
moment to consider the impact of the open source ideology of
the project. A core value of many of the currently produced
digital humanities projects is an open and free archive. This
approach generally implies that users experience the free use
of archive materials delivered through the web and, in rare
instances, the development of open source tools that may be
applicable to projects that use similar standards, such as
TEI/XML. What has been given little attention, both in practice
and in theory, has been a careful consideration of how
non-academic open source programs might be leveraged for
digital humanities projects, particularly digital archives, and
what the positive and negative impact of such an approach
might be. Using the Digital Concord project as a test case, the
paper examines the possibilities offered by contemporary
web-based technologies. This paper will discuss two such
possible non-academic open source tools as well as planning
practices. The presentation will then extrapolate from the
experience of archive development to generalize some of the
ways that non-academic open source approaches might
positively and negatively impact digital humanities.
Of the various non-academic open source applications in use
in the construction of the Digital Concord archive, this paper
will focus on the two: Ruby on Rails and Google Map Hacks.

Ruby on Rails
Ruby on Rails has produced some of the hottest buzz of recent
open source technologies. Rails is a web application framework
that not only offers amazing capabilities, but has attracted some
of the best and brightest of the open source development
community. It is particularly useful to digital humanities work
because it shows remarkable promise for rapid development
of real world applications and works well with TEI/XML,
relational databases, and RDF, a means of relating disparate
information. And, given the interest in Rails, the development
community has begun development of a broad set of beta
programs that, with some modification, might prove helpful to
our current digital humanities work. During the presentation,
I will highlight some of the uses that Rails offers and discuss
positive and negative impacts of the approach.

Google Map Hacks
In an attempt to provide multiple user interfaces and remedy
the lack of responsiveness to a user experience with some digital
humanities work, the Digital Concord project has sought to
develop multiple interfaces. One such interface is visual and
based on a manipulation of Google Maps. While GIS is a
well-developed tool and has been applied to some digital
humanities projects, there are other tools that might be of greater
use to digital humanists due to cost, development, and specific
disciplinary needs. Rather than rely on GIS tools, the Concord
archive experiments with programs that are under development
in an open source community in the expectation that such an
approach will offer a way for academics to tap into a previously
unexplored group of participants and developers. The advances
made by individuals interested in such maps are ongoing;
projects chronicled at the blog “Google Maps Mania” <http
://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/> show the
possibilities for incorporating Google maps with a variety of
data. Using the Concord interface as a starting point, the paper
will discuss multiple possibilities for Google Map Hacks.

Designing Humanities Data for Open Source
Developers
While the use of such open source technologies might have a
very real impact on digital projects, the potential for engaging
the open source community in digital humanities offers an even
greater opportunity. Models from Moodle to the BBC backstage
project <http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/> suggest that
the possibilities for engaging a broad developer community in
digital work is possible with the right set of data and appropriate
interface. While the Digital Concord project has no illusions
of generating the type of interest as seen in previously
mentioned projects, there are ways that the project can open
data and create a community of interest around digital
humanities work that could have positive repercussions. The
paper will close with a discussion of potential strategies that
individual archives might take to interest the open source
community.

Interfacing with the Open Source Community:
An OSCOM approach
James Smith
Academic progress seems to depend on a person's ability to
contribute to society as measured by attributable work such as
articles and monographs in areas that are interesting to society.
These attributions depend on copyrights and patents, the keys
to establishing and protecting intellectual property ownership.
The various print journals and publishing houses act as a
peer-reviewed intermediary. The academy establishes social
Page 47

Digital Humanities 2007
interest in a project by the project's ability to attract financial
support.
Digital Humanities (DH) relies heavily on what is now being
called Web 2.0: technologies that allow nearly seamless
cross-platform client/server applications (e.g., AJAX and
Comet). Most of these technologies have roots in the Open
Source Community (OSC). Much of the talent is also in the
OSC. Until this talent is brought into DH, DH is in danger of
being a field looking in from outside, watching technology
advance as it tries to catch up. Yet, DH is rooted in the academy
and must meet the expectations of the academy.
The Open Source Community has its roots in the academy, but
has lived for a while in the wild among amateurs in the classic
sense. Many people participate in open source because they
enjoy doing so, though some participate because of their
employment. The OSC is built on a stereotype of the academy:
information is free and everyone is able to work on problems
they find interesting. Just as professors enjoy working in a
University or College with other smart people in their field,
OSC members are attracted to projects with smart people. OSC
members also value the openness with which they can develop
and discuss projects.
The Open Source Community has not abandoned the notion of
attribution and social relevancy. The openness of a project's
development creates a trajectory along which the project travels.
This trajectory is a measure of the talent behind the project and
is apparent to most who are interested in the project.
Misappropriating a particular release of a project captures only
a single point on that trajectory. Because any particular release
of a project does not bring with it any of the talent behind the
project, `stealing' from the project is worth much less.
Attribution in the OSC is much more than just the name beside
the copyright or on the patent.
An Open Source project is socially relevant if it is widely used
and has a strong community. There are no financial
requirements for a project to be successful. Sorceforge.net hosts
Open Source projects at no cost to the project not because any
particular project is worth the cost, but because the OSC itself
is socially relevant. People contribute their time to a project
not necessarily because they get paid but because they enjoy
the project and, if they make significant contributions, they can
become a well known talent in the OSC.
The problem, then, is how to balance the requirements of the
academy against the need to create an environment that is
inviting to the open source community. By openly involving
the open source community, DH can access a wide variety of
talent which will be involved in various projects not because
they are being paid to help, but because they love the project.
At the same time, DH can maintain the attribution required for
academic progress.
Page 48

One academic field of study that is leading the way with
technology is Physics with the development of the world wide
web at CERN to aid in sharing documents to the electronic
pre-print server (<http://xxx.lanl.gov/> ). The Physics
community can do this because it is small enough that its
members know each other. Reputation is built much as it is in
the Open Source Community: by personal experiences between
members of the community. Formal peer review plays a
secondary role. By reviewing the output of a physicist, another
can see the pattern and tell if something new fits that pattern.
If any company represents the commercial potential of Digital
Humanities, it is Google. They have been able to attract some
of the top talent in the industry by providing a work
environment that resembles the Open Source Community in
many aspects. Some of the more interesting projects for DH
have come from employees' `play time.' Google has brought a
lot of smart people together under one roof, much as a
University or College might do.
By looking to other academic fields and the Open Source
Community, Digital Humanities can create a new environment
encouraging rapid evolution of ideas without sacrificing the
need for attribution, reputation, or social relevance.

Synergies: The Canadian
Information Network for
Research in the Social Sciences
and the Humanities

unded by the Canada Foundation for Innovations,
“Synergies: The Canadian Information Network for
Research in the Social Sciences and Humanities” will be a
national distributed platform with a wide range of tools to
support the creation, distribution, access and archiving of digital
objects such as journal articles. It will enable the distribution
and use of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) research, as
well as to create a resource and platform for pure and applied
research. In short, Synergies will be a research tool and a
dissemination tool that will greatly enhance the potential and
impact of SSH scholarship.

that will place their work on record and will ensure widespread
and flexible access. Synergies provides both these functions.
Built on the foundation of Érudit, a Quebec-based research
publication service provider in existence since 1998, Open
Journal Systems, which is a tested online journal publishing
software suite, and the technical expertise developed by its
three other partners, Synergies will integrate work being done
within its five-party consortium to create a decentralized
national platform for SSH research communication. Synergies
is designed to eventually encompass a range of
formats—including published articles, pre-publication papers,
data sets, presentations, electronic monographs—to provide a
rich scholarly record, the backbone of which is existing and
yet to be created peer-review journals. Synergies will bring
Canadian SSH research into mainstream of worldwide research
discourse using a cost-effective public/not-for-profit partnership
to maximize knowledge dissemination.

Canadian SSH research published in Canadian journals and
elsewhere, especially in English, is largely confined to print.
The dynamics of print mean that this research is
machine-opaque and hence invisible on the internet, where
many students and scholars begin and sometimes end their
background research. In bringing Canadian SSH research to
the internet, Synergieswill not only bring that research into the
mainstream of worldwide research discourse but also it will
legitimize online publication in SSH. The acceptance of this
medium will open the manner in which knowledge can be
represented. On one plane, researchers will be able to take
advantage of an enriched media palette—color, image, sound,
moving images, multimedia. On a second plane, researchers
will be able to take advantage of interactivity. And on a third
plane, those who query existing research will be able to broaden
their vision by means of navigational interfaces, multilingual
interrogation and automatic translation, metadata and intelligent
search engines, and textual analysis. On still another plane
scholars will be able to expand new areas of knowledge such
as bibliometrics and technometrics, new media analysis,
scholarly communicational analysis and publishing studies.

The members of the Synergies consortium are the University
of New Brunswick, Université de Montréal (lead institution),
University of Toronto, University of Calgary, and Simon Fraser
University. Each brings appropriate but different expertise to
the project. At its first level, Synergies consists of this
five-university consortium that will provide a fully accessible,
searchable, decentralized and inclusive national SSH database
of structured primary and secondary SSH texts. This distributed
environment is technically complex to implement, and it also
represents a major political and social collaboration which
attests to the project’s transformative dimension for Canadian
SSH research and researchers. Synergies will be a primary
aggregator of research that, in providing publishing services,
will allow journals editors (and other producers) to structure
subscriptions and maintain revenue control. At a second level,
Synergies will reach out to 16 regional partner universities who
will benefit from and contribute to extend Synergies
functionality. At a third level, in a producer-to-consumer
relationship with university libraries and organizations such as
the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN), Synergies
will make possible national accessibility. Using this relationship
as a model, Synergies will be positioned to facilitate similar
relationships for journals with buyer consortia around the world.
Synergies is not only a pan-Canadian technical infrastructure
but also a mobilizing and enabling resource for the entire
scholarly community of Canadian SSH researchers. In
embracing the whole of the social sciences and humanities,
Synergies will foster cross-disciplinary, problem- and
issue-oriented queries while also allowing queries that can be
time-framed, discipline-based, media or methodologically
specific, theoretically constrained or geo-referenced.

Canadian researchers in the SSH require two research
communication services that can be provided within one
structure. The first is an accessible online Canadian research
record. The second is access to an online publication service

Synergies will also provide a needed infrastructure for the Social
Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) to follow
through its in-principle commitment to open access and
facilitate its implementation by extending the current venues
Page 49

Digital Humanities 2007
and means for online publishing in Canada. With Synergies in
place the funding of journals based on dissemination
effectiveness rather than sales levels will become both feasible
for journals and possible as a evaluative criterion for SSHRC
funding. The Canadian Federation for the Humanities and Social
Sciences, with a membership of over 30,000, has also recently
adopted a position in favor of open access and indicate the role
that Synergies can play.
In summary, Synergies is the vehicle by which Canadian SSH
research communication can be modernized. It embraces
emerging research practice by utilizing existing texts, enriching,
expanding, and greatly easing access to scholarly data and to
audiences. It organizes a fragmented research record, ensuring
and enhancing access to existing data sets. It facilitates access
via aggregation of journals and an ability to facilitate
agreements between Canadian SSH journals and other
producers' and buyers' consortia such as CRKN. It lays a
foundation for expanding the research record to encompass all
scholarly inquiry in order to achieve maximum accessibility
and circulation. Synergies represents a project in parallel with
other national projects and disciplinary databases emerging in
other countries, for example, Project Muse, Euclid, JStor, and
HighWire in the United States, and in France, Persée and
Adonis.

How Rhythmical is Hexameter:
A Statistical Approach to Ancient
Epic Poetry
Maciej Eder
(maciejeder@poczta.ijp-pan.krakow.pl)
Polish Academy of Sciences

I

n this paper, I argue that the later a given specimen of
hexamater is, the less rhythmical it tends to be. A brief
discussion of the background of ancient Greek and Latin metrics
and its connections to orality is followed by an account of
spectral density analysis as my chosen method. I then go on to
comment on the experimental data obtained by representing
several samples of ancient poetry as coded sequences of binary
values. Hexameter’s decreasing rhythmicity is then illustrated
with reference to particular authors. In the last section, I suggest
how spectral density analysis may help to account for other
features of ancient meter.
The ancient epic poems, especially the most archaic Greek
poetry attributed to Homer, are usually referred as an
extraordinary fact in the history of European literature. For
present-day readers educated in a culture of writing, it seems
unbelievable that such a large body of poetry should have been
composed in a culture based on oral transmission. In fact,
despite of genuine singers' and audience's memory, epic poems
did not emerge at once as fixed texts, but they were
re-composed in each performance (Lord 2000, Foley 1993,
Nagy 1996). The surviving ancient epic poetry displays some
features that reflect archaic techniques of oral composition,
formulaic structure being probably the most characteristic (Parry
1971: 37-117).
Since formulaic diction prefers some fixed rhythmical patterns
(Parry 1971: 8-21), we can ask some questions about the role
of both versification and rhythm in oral composition. Why was
all of ancient epic poetry, both Greek and Latin, composed in
one particular type of meter called hexameter? Does the choice
of meter influence the rhythmicity of a text? Why does
hexameter, in spite of its relatively restricted possibilities of
shaping rhythm, differ so much from one writer to another some
(cf. Duckworth 1969: 37-87)? And, last but not least, what
possible reasons are there for those wide differences between
particular authors?
It is commonly known that poetry is in general easier to
memorize than prose, because rhythm itself tends to facilitate

Page 50

Digital Humanities 2007
memorization. In a culture without writing, memorization is
crucial, and much depends on the quality of oral transmission.
In epic poems from an oral culture rhythm is thus likely to be
particularly important for both singers and hearers, even though
they need not consciously perceive poetic texts as rhythmical
to benefit from rhythm as an aid to memory.
It may then be expected on theoretical grounds that non-oral
poems, such as the Latin epic poetry or the Greek hexameter
of the Alexandrian age, will be largely non-rhythmical, or at
least display weaker rhythm effects than the archaic poems of
Homer and Hesiod. Although formulaic diction and other
techniques of oral composition are noticeable mostly in Homer’s
epics (Parry 1971, Lord 2000, Foley 1993, etc.), the later
hexameters, both Greek and Latin, also display some features
of oral diction (Parry 1971: 24-36). The metrical structure of
hexameter might be quite similar: strongly rhythmical in the
oldest (or rather, the most archaic) epic poems, and less
conspicuous in poems composed in written form a few centuries
after Homer. The aim of the present study is to test the
hypothesis that the later a given specimen of hexameter is, the
less rhythmical it tends to be.
Because of its nature versification easily lends itself to statistical
analysis. A great deal of work has already been done in this
field, including studies of Greek and Latin hexameter (Jones
& Gray 1972, Duckworth 1969, Foley 1993, etc.). However,
the main disadvantage of the methods applied in existing
research is that they describe a given meter as if it were a set
of independent elements, which is actually not true. In each
versification system, the specific sequence of elements plays a
far more important role in establishing a particular type of
rhythm than the relations between those elements regardless
their linear order (language "in the mass" vs. language "in the
line"; cf. Pawlowski 1999).
Fortunately, there are a few methods of statistical analysis (both
numeric and probabilistic) that study verse by means of an
ordered sequence of elements. These methods include, for
example, time series modeling, Fourier analysis, the theory of
Markov chains and Shannon's theory of information. In the
present study, spectral density analysis was used (Gottman
1999, Priestley 1981, etc.). Spectral analysis seems to be a very
suitable tool because it provides a cross-section of a given time
series: it allows us to detect waves, regularities and cycles which
are not otherwise manifest and open to inspection. In the case
of a coded poetry sample, the spectrogram shows not only
simple repetitions of metrical patterns, but also some subtle
rhythmical relations, if any, between distant lines or stanzas.

(Theogony), Apollonius (Argonautica, book 1), Aratos
(Phainomena), Nonnos (Dionysiaca, book 1), Vergil (Aeneid,
book 3), Horace (Ars poetica), and Ovid (Metamorphoses, book
1). In each sample, the first 500 lines were coded in such a way
that each long syllable was assigned value 1, and each short
syllable value 0. Though it is disputed whether ancient verse
was purely quantitative or whether it also had some prosodic
features (Pawlowski & Eder 2001), the quantity-based nature
of Greek and Roman meter was never questioned. It is possible
that rhythm was generated not only by quantity, but it is certain
that quantity itself played an essential role in ancient meter.
Thus, in the coding procedure, all prosodic features were left
out except the quantity of syllables (cf. Jones & Gray 1972,
Duckworth 1969, Foley 1993, etc.). A binary-coded series was
then obtained for each sample, e.g., book 22 of the Iliad begins
as a series of values:
1110010010010011100100100100111001110010010011...
The coded samples were analyzed by means of the spectral
density function. As might be expected, on each spectogram
there appeared a few peaks indicating the existence of several
rhythmical waves in the data. However, while the peaks
suggesting the existence of 2- and 3-syllable patterns it the text
were very similar for all the spectograms and quite obvious,
the other peaks showed some large differences between the
samples. Perhaps the most surprising was the peak echoing the
wave with a 16-syllable period, which could be found in the
samples of early Greek poems by Homer, Hesiod, Apollonius,
and Aratos. The same peak was far less noticeable in the late
Greek hexameter of Nonnos, and totally absent in the samples
of Latin writers. Other differences between the spectograms
have corroborated the observation: the rhythmical effects of
the late poems were, in general, weaker as compared with the
rich rhythmical structure of the earliest, orally composed epic
poems.
Although the main hypothesis has been verified, the results
also showed some peculiarities. For example, the archaic poems
by Homer and Hesiod did not differ significantly from the
poems of the Alexandrian age (Apollonius, Aratos), which was
rather unexpected. Again, the rhythm of the Latin hexameter
turned out to have a different underlying structure than that of
all the Greek samples. There are some possible explanations
of those facts, such as that the weaker rhythm of the Latin
samples may relate to inherent differences between Latin and
Greek. More research, both in statistics and in philology, is
needed, however, to make such explanations more nuanced and
more persuasive.

To verify the hypothesis of hexameter’s decreasing rhythmicity,
7 samples of Greek and 3 samples of Latin epic poetry were
chosen. The specific selection of sample material was as
follows: 3 samples from Homeric hexameter (books 18 and 22
from the Iliad, book 3 from the Odyssey), 1 sample from Hesiod

Introduction

I

n the last couple of years, there has been a growing interest
towards including into TEI documents information about
the world rather than information concerning the text of the
document to be encoded only. We see examples of this through
recent additions to the TEI standard, e.g. the person element
(TEI P5, sec. 20.4.2), as well as through the work in the
Ontologies SIG since it was established in 2004 (TEI Ontology
SIG WIKI). In the SIG, the topic of discussion is how to
organise this kind of information about the world according to
specific ontologies.
One particularly promising ontology in this context is the CRM
(CIDOC 2003). It has been used together with Topic Maps to
organize information from TEI documents (Tuohy 2006) and
as an attempt to find a solution to the so-called exhibition
problem (Eide 2006). Further, attempts have been made to
formalise a way to connect TEI and CRM documents (Ore
2006).
In this paper, we propose a method for automatic generation
of CRM conforming models based on TEI documents. We will
discuss limitations to this approach, as well as ways these may
be overcome.

Page 52

Digital Humanities 2007

Our proposed method

T

he method we propose will include two important steps
that should be possible to implement to any given TEI
document: Mapping and model building.

Mapping
A mapping from the TEI document into a model conforming
with CRM should be created. It will be based on a general
mapping of TEI elements to CRM we are currently developing.
But in TEI, many elements are defined quite loose, and
depending on the way they are used, they may be modelled
differently in CRM. According to the TEI guidelines, tag usage
may be described in the TEI header. Such descriptions may
help to decide which type of modelling is the most appropriate.
Ideally, such a specific mapping should be created based on an
automatic reading of the TEI header. But an element description
in a tagUsage element in the TEI header is in prose and will
generally not be stringent enough to be understood by an
automatic reading (TEI P5, sec. 5.3.4). Human interaction will
be needed. It may be the case that use of the equiv element will
make automatic creation of mappings possible, as a reference
to a certain CRM class may be included as an external link
(ibid, sec. 6.3.4).

Model building
A CRM conforming model based on the TEI document and
populated with all instances of mapped elements should then
be created. This model may be used as a query or a data mining
system where the user looks for interesting structures in the
CRM conforming model alone, as well as in combination with
textual information collected from the TEI source document.
But this model may also be used in connection with other CRM
conforming models, such as museum databases. The
connections will be based on regional or global object
identification, such as authority lists of names and classification
schema. The resulting "super model" may then be used as a
data mining tool based on semantic integration between
heterogeneous resources.

dates tagged. A short paragraph of this tagged version, based
on page 73 in the printed book, is translated to English and
included below.
<p xml:id="s1_24449"> Answ: Named <name type="person"
xml:id="s1_24454"> Ole Nilsen</name>, is born in <name
type="place" xml:id="s1_24457"> Tydals </name> mountains,
Which is in
<name type="place" xml:id="s1_24460"> Norway </name>,
of Sami parents, is 50 years old, married, and having one child;
has mostly dwelled in <name type="place" xml:id="s1_24466"
> Tydals </name> mountains, and now dwelling in the
Norwegian <name type="place" xml:id="s1_24469">
Mærragers </name> mountains. </p>

What is tagged — and what is not
Names and dates are tagged in our document. This means that
many references to persons, places and times are included. But
there are a lot of other references to similar real world entities
that are not tagged, e.g. when words other than proper names
are used to refer to them. In the example above, "one child" is
not tagged, whereas other references to the same historical
person in terms of his or her name are tagged as person names.
Furthermore, events are not tagged in this text. Thus, whereas
the name of a boy who is born and the place of his birth is
tagged, the event connecting these together, i.e. the birth, is not
marked up.
This is common to most TEI documents, and is based on the
text centric tradition of the TEI community. There were good
reasons why this tradition was established, but it may be the
case that for some types of documents, textual references to
e.g. events should be marked up.
A simple CRM model of parts of the paragraph above is
included as Figure 1. The solid lines represent what can be
directly read from XML elements in the TEI document, whereas
the dotted lines shows the parts not based on the TEI markup.
This shows that the information needed to model the connection
between the person and the mountain - that he was born there
- is not tagged in the TEI document.

An example of a TEI input document

W

e are currently developing the building blocks for a
system based on the method described above. The
example text used in our work is taken from a manuscript
describing examinations about geographical matters performed
as court interviews in 1740s, printed in the 1960s (Schnitler
1962). The printed edition was digitised and marked up in a
typical TEI way, with names of places and people as well as

Figure 1

Page 53

Digital Humanities 2007
How to find the events
As the models created through the use of our proposed method
is based on the XML tags alone, important information in the
text is not considered when the model is created. Several
possible ways to improve this exist. One is automatic event
detection, as used e.g. in the Perseus project (Smith 2002). The
use of this method too causes some problems. One problem is
that fact that even if the system works quite good for English
material, considerable work remains to be done to create a
similar tool for 18th century Danish, even though the method
is implemented also for smaller languages such as Finnish
(Makkonen 2003). Named entity recognition systems are
developed for modern Danish (Johannessen 2004), but this is
of no use in the common situation where names are already
tagged in the documents. Another problem is the fact that these
kinds of methods will always be imperfect, resulting in either
missed events, false positives, or both of these.
Another way to solve the problem would be to reread the text,
identifying events and tagging them. This would be a reliable
method, but time-consuming. Even a combination of these
strategies, a semi automatic method, would mean quite a lot of
work.
A possible way to solve the problem of event identification is
to use the model. Any person or place in the CRM model has
a link to the name of the person or place, an from the name in
the CRM model to the TEI name element. This means that the
textual distance to other person name elements, place name
elements and date elements can be calculated. Further, it is
possible to locate all words within a certain distance, and all
words between two names.
This is similar to the first approach above. But in addition, we
propose to connect the CRM model to external databases. An
example of this would be if we have a CRM version of a
database based on church book records. In this church book
based CRM model a person may be found with a name similar
to Ole Nilsen, a birth date in a possible range for being a witness
in 1742, and a birth place with a name similar to a place name
mentioned in the text in connection to the person's name. This
external source may then help us to include the E67 Birth event
in our model. This may turn out to be impossible without
manual work, but we hope at least to make the manual work
more effective.

Conclusion

A

general observation from our work is that the more
relevant information types is marked up in a TEI
document, the easier it is to use automatic methods to generate
CRM conforming models. But even a limited tagging with only
Page 54

names and dates marked up do help. We will continue our work
on the implementation of a system based on the method
described in this abstract. We believe this will improve the
usability of TEI documents as information sources as well as
simplifying the process of adding more information, such as
event elements, into such documents.

Bits and Pieces of Text:
Appraisal of a Natural Electronic
Archive
Maria Esteva (mesteva@mail.utexas.edu)

University of Texas at Austin

T

his paper presents the methods and tools designed to
appraise a digital archive. The attributes characterizing
the archive at hand led to the development of the concept of
natural electronic archives that would allow transforming the
archive as a whole into a unit of analysis. The methodology for
appraising the archive combines traditional archival concepts
while adding tools –such as text mining and social network
analysis– taken from other fields.
The digital archive belongs to a philanthropic agency whose
activities in support of the arts, sciences and social welfare in
Argentina span from the mid 1980s until its closure in
December of 2005. In the early 1990s the institution
implemented a networked server to store, retrieve, and share
electronic texts, email, applications, and databases. In it, each
employee had a virtual folder with his or her initials to store
the files that they created. To comply with legal requirements
the archive must be kept closed but accessible for the next 10
years. In parallel, appraisal needed to be undertaken to decide
on the archive’s long term destiny. An initial survey of the
archive led to the development of the natural archive concept
and suggested an appraisal method to establish archival
evidence.
The natural electronic archive concept grew while I was
surveying the server and from the interviews conducted with
staff members who had worked in the organization since it
opened. Based on my analysis, I concluded that the manner in
which records were generated and kept could not easily be
ascribed to digital archiving models currently discussed in the
literature. These models focus more on the creation of sound
electronic records, the design of electronic record-keeping
systems, and on institutional repository archiving models than
on the way in which digital archives exist “in the wild”
(Bearman & Trant, 1997; Cox, 1997; Duranti et al., 2002;
InterPARES Authenticity Task Force 2002; Jones et al., 2006).
The natural archive concept builds partly on that of “natural
collections” proposed by Phillip Cronenwett to describe
collections of literary manuscripts as they leave the hand of the
creator (Cronnenwett, 1984, p.106). I suggest that this concept
Page 55

Digital Humanities 2007
is relevant both to the case study at hand, as well as to archives
of public or private persons and institutions showing similar
characteristics.
Creation of natural electronic archives involves a set of ad-hoc
practices developed as people adjust to and learn how to use
information technologies. A natural archive is not designed or
managed by records managers or archivists. Instead, it is what
those working in institutions, in different capacities, using
different technologies, and making decisions, make of it. In a
natural archive, records are created, named, destroyed, or
retained according to individual work-practices. Each record
creator decides on structure and naming conventions for files
and folders, spontaneously or consistently, according to
individual mnemonic rules or the spur of the moment. Within
the virtual folders, images, spreadsheets, texts, web sites,
databases, back-ups, and applications live together under the
same roof, placed or misplaced, in organized or disorganized
fashion, in general without descriptive clues.
In a context without explicit recordkeeping rules, bits and pieces
of text are ubiquitous inhabitants. Either shared by different
members of a network or used repeatedly by their creators, they
constitute the core of many records. This repetition of fragments
afforded by the cut and paste function of the text editor, speaks
as much of provenance, group collaboration and fair use, as of
hierarchies and corporate culture. As a consequence of all of
these phenomena, records within a natural archive are difficult
to identify and lack formal documentation. This creates doubts
about their capacity to provide evidence.
An appraisal method that uses Text Mining and Social Network
Analysis was designed to determine what type of evidence of
the organization that created it is provided by a natural
electronic archive. The method is rooted in concerns expressed
by Peter Boticelli in his study of networked organizations
(Boticelli, 2000). It considers the need to document dynamics
and changes in organizations and it explores the meaning of
evidence and archival bond –understood as the “network of
relationships between records” – in an ambiguous environment
(Duranti & Guercio, 1997). Also, it highlights the importance
of preserving evidence of the archive’s formation process that
will allow the study of its technological history and social uses
(Lubar, 1996; Parezo, 1996). Its main departure from other
appraisal methods is that it uses digital tools to analyze a large
corpus of records inductively.
Determining archival evidence implies being able to map the
organization through its records. Text Mining and Social
Network Analysis use computing algorithms to discover
knowledge about the relations among electronic records. By
measuring the similarity between texts produced and
co-produced by staff members within frameworks of time and
provenance, the strength of relationships between records and
between the staff members and/or functions that created them
Page 56

can be established. In turn, by averaging the similarities between
the records of all pairs of staff members or functions across
time, organizational structure and functions as well as
correspondent changes in dynamics emerge. To confirm the
validity of the findings, results are contrasted against the
narratives of staff members about who they collaborated with,
when, and in what. In this way, the evidence provided by the
electronic records in this natural archive can be attested
A proof of concept was conducted to determine the feasibility
of the appraisal method. For this, copies of electronic text
records from the archive were used, while the original archive,
kept with its directory structure intact, remains as guarantee of
provenance and original order. Pre-processing documents
involved using file management software to sort files within
directories and sub-directories to construct sets belonging to a
group of staff members that worked in the organization during
a one year period. After conversion to .txt format, the sets were
submitted to Rainbow, an open source text classification and
retrieval tool, to obtain a vector space model (McCallum, 1996).
In this phase, several trials were conducted to find the best way
to narrow the vocabulary without losing language subtleties.
From this model, pair-wise distances between documents where
calculated using the cosine similarity formula in MatLab on a
UNIX server. The resultant matrix was submitted to the social
network analysis software UCINET to obtain a network drawing
of the distances between texts (Borgatti et al., 2002). In turn,
the average of distances corresponding to each staff member
were calculated to obtain a matrix of relationships between staff
members during one year.
The experiment suggested that relationships between staff
members do emerge from the similarities and differences
between the texts that they create. Testing showed that staff
members who were leaving the organization and wrote farewell
or personal records were less related to those cooperating in
the preparation of monthly or annual reports. Also, project
proposals written by grant applicants and stored in the shared
server were barely related to reports or appropriation requests
written by members of the organization. These preliminary
results indicated that shifts in functions and consequent
relationships between staff members can emerge from electronic
texts.
The proof of concept also examined the use of cluster analysis
to explore the concept of archival bond in natural electronic
archives. Analyzing the content of strongly and poorly related
records can explain what characterizes relationships between
records –provenance, date, type of record, contents, topic – and
whether these features can be mapped onto theoretical
conceptualizations of archival bond. It will also explain the role
of drafts, versions, and non-records by finding the proportion
in which they exist in the natural archive and how close or not
they are to complete records.

Digital Humanities 2007
Before issuing the final appraisal protocol, changes had to be
implemented and concerns addressed. Since the archive contains
formats as old as Microsoft Word 5.0 for DOS, a converter
with broad file format support was found to transform old files
to ANSI text so they can be processed by Rainbow. Because
there are various pieces of software involved, processes need
to be automated and simplified as much as possible and issues
related to the size of the text sets and matrices vis a vis the
power of the processing tools have to be considered. Through
a research grant from the University of Texas at Austin a
programmer was hired to modify existing applications and
develop new ones. Rainbow’s tokenizer was modified to
recognize Spanish characters and to include the Oleander
Spanish stemmer (Oleander Solutions, 2006). The cosine
similarity algorithm was coded in C++ so that bigger matrices
can be processed efficiently in a UNIX server. To improve the
ability to distinguish the characteristics of individual texts,
Tf-idf capabilities were added to the script. The program outputs
both a matrix of cosine similarities between every other
document and a matrix of the averages of cosine similarity
distances between every other author in the sample. Current
testing involves processing sets with all the texts produced in
one year by every author to determine changes in collaboration
dynamics. After processing the matrices with UCINET,
preliminary results for author’s yearly averages show
relationships that concur with their functions in the institution
(See Fig. 1 and 2).

Figure 2. Network drawing of averages of cosine similarities between 719
records of different staff members during the year 1997. As new staff members
added their records in the networked directory and started their own
relationships, the majority of the director’s previous relationships and his
status in the network remained stable.

The use of Text Mining and Social Network Analysis promises
to allow archivists to explore and define the meaning of
evidence in natural electronic archives. Instead of intuition and
art, as appraisal has been characterized, the opportunity exists
to use inductive quantitative methods to make of appraisal a
research endeavor (Eastwood, 1992). Moreover, the use of these
methods opens the doors to the enormous potential of digital
tools in the analysis and processing of digital archives.

s questions and concerns about digital preservation and
sustainability become increasingly audible in the spheres
of digital humanities and humanities computing, the necessity
to build strong ties between digital humanities and digital
libraries only intensifies. Howard Besser, in his essay, The Past,
Present, and Future of Digital Libraries,” underscores the
connections between these two fields. He explains digital
libraries not only “provide access to original source material,
contextualization, and commentaries, but they also provide a
set of additional resources and service”.1 Besser then delineates
some of these resources and services, including digital
collections of traditional print materials, lexical analysis, and
increased accessibility. In addition to these important
contributions to humanities research, I would like to highlight
the emerging role libraries play in processing, preserving,
maintaining, and providing access to important archives that
house born-digital content. This role will not only contribute
to humanities research in decades to come, but will also impact
how research is performed by directing what content is made
available and how researches may access it.
In this paper, I will examine the Emory University Libraries’
acquisition and processing of a singular personal archive as a
case study to explore the methods and practices of handling
born-digital archival materials and the implications such
methodologies and their outcomes may have on humanities
research.
Emory University’s acquisition of Salman Rushdie’s personal
archive represents an important addition to the Manuscript and
Rare Books Library, and contributes significantly to the
University’s digital library resources and research. Rushdie’s
rich personal archive includes traditional manuscript materials
such as journals, personal correspondence, and notebooks, as
well as less traditional archival materials, namely a series of
personal computers that cover a significant span in his personal
and literary life. This digital archive includes five computers,
one early Macintosh desktop and four Macintosh laptops,
including both obsolete and current models. While MARBL
has previously acquired collections containing some digital
materials, Rushdie’s computers represent the first significant,

sizeable digital component to the University’s extensive
holdings of rare and unique materials.
Such an acquisition requires archivists to engage with
technologists to ensure that the library can most effectively
serve current and future researchers and scholars. The curation
of such an archive raises important questions about how libraries
should process, index, and present these materials while
simultaneously addressing preservation and authenticity
concerns. Such questions include: What is the research value
of such an archive? How important is the physical artifact? Do
researchers need access to exact systems emulation? Is
providing search and browse access to the data sufficient or
will researchers be interested in Rushdie’s original directory
structure? Once data is migrated from the original environments,
do we continue to maintain those outdated systems? How do
archives sustain both master and access instances of born-digital
archives?
As digital librarians and archivists at Emory begin processing
the born-digital components of this important archive, they
must keep these questions, and the host of secondary concerns
circulating around them, in the foreground of workflow and
process discussions. In this paper, I will argue for the
importance of balancing the urgent needs of data and system
stabilization with the more long-term challenges of considering
the ideal outcomes and products of processing and providing
access to a rare and unique born-digital archive. This talk will
track the early stages of processing the physical and digital
materials comprising Rushdie’s digital archive, outline
approaches to handling the more complex processing
requirements, discuss proposed approaches to presenting the
archive to both local and distant researchers, and generalize
observations drawn from the experiences with this born-digital
archive to broader implications within digital libraries, digital
curation, and humanities computing.

questions of data recovery, data preservation, and data
duplication. Such challenges prompted us to develop a
partitioned data architecture that duplicates and preserves all
master data. The original is preserved, a master duplicate is
generated and stored darkly, a duplicate collection of the master
database is housed in a secure repository for in-house processing
and staging, and, finally, a fully-processed instance of the data
is made available through a production database. Such an
approach provides for preservation of original artifacts and
master data, while ensuring a level of security for data while it
is being processed for embargoed material.
In addition to preservation and security, authenticity of the
archived data is of particular importance to archivists, digital
librarians, and humanities researchers. Graham Barwell’s
discussions about originality and authenticity within the fields
of textual studies and electronic textuality resonate with archives
such as Rushdie’s born-digital materials.3 How can we most
authentically represent the digital archives included in the
Rushdie collection? Is the data the only component of real
research value or is the context that holds this data, the
paratextual elements, if you will, of equal importance to
researchers? I will explore these questions and provide
illustrations from our processing of the Rushdie archive to offer
some preliminary insights.

With the acquisition of any archive, a research library takes on
multiple responsibilities to preserve, index, and provide access
to the rare and unique materials. Libraries—digital, brick and
mortar, or otherwise—must “incorporate the component of
stewardship over a collection.”2 Such stewardship carries with
it important responsibilities, especially in cases of archival
materials. Thus, with the arrival of the first shipment of
Rushdie’s digital archive, consisting of three out of the five
computers, our library and archive staff faced both immediate
preservation demands and distant challenges for archival
curation. We elected to produce a workflow that is both staged
and modular, which I will only summarize here. The first task
is to provide a secure and stable environment for the machines
themselves. As our archives had not previously included
technological artifacts, this first step required some intensive
space and environment analysis. Once we stabilized the physical
objects, this born digital archive next challenged staff with

Markup and the Digital Paratext

Abstract:

A

ccording to the French rhetorician and literary critic
Gerard Genette a paratext is a transitional zone: a
privileged space of a "pragmatics", of "strategy", and of action
over the audience (Genette 1997). In a digital environment, the
idea of the paratext may allow us to recognize the significance
and the mode of operation of certain crucial textual formations
that might otherwise seem inconsequential. These formations,
unlike traditional paratexts, are not always literally visible as
part of the legible textual surface, but instead operate through
the representational and performative mechanisms of the digital
interface. Their separateness is demarcated through markup,
which not only creates a boundary between text and paratext
but also makes the paratext into a space of function and
behavior: of meaning instantiated through action rather than
simply through textual signification.

Proposal:

A

ccording to the French rhetorician and literary critic
Gerard Genette a paratext is a transitional zone: a
privileged space of a "pragmatics", of "strategy", and of action
over the audience (Genette 1997). This paratextual
space—instantiated in what are traditionally considered
secondary or ancillary texts such as footnotes, commentary,
translation, and so forth—produces and ramifies the "main"
text, the object that is thus presented to our interest as primarily
significant. It is precisely through the paratexts that the concept
of a "main" text emerges at all: in a given historical moment,
depending on social, cultural, political, and other factors, a
certain text emerges, and slowly starts to circulate and acquire
status through the effects of its paratexts: comments, editions,
translations, dedications, and so forth.
In a digital environment, the idea of the paratext may allow us
to recognize the significance and the mode of operation of
certain crucial textual formations that might otherwise seem
inconsequential. An example of such a formation is the
Page 60

information we might call "microtexts": that is, external,
contingently visible “microcontents” (Nielsen 2000) that
describe, illustrate or complete information within a web page
or resource. These include also embedded alternate texts that
usually appear when you move the mouse over an image, link
or any other semiotic device (Zinna 2005). Another example
is what we might call "metatexts", a category embracing both
formal metadata and also looser kinds of descriptive, normative
or regulative information, usually not directly visible to the
user, that is added in order to allow search engines and other
processing to produce coherent and useful results.
These terms arise from an external classification (one which
could be extended) emphasizing the different ways these
paratexts function as part of a publication architecture. But
digital paratexts can be also organized, according to their
cognitive and semiotic functions, into at least three flexible
(and mutually permeable) categories:
1. 1. descriptive (syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes): those
paratexts which contain information about a text, including
various kinds of metadata;
2. 2. normative: those which constrain the behavior of the text
(for instance, schemas)
3. 3. pragmatic: those which mediate or represent the text as
a discursive object, and which produce its digital
phenomenology.
These formations, unlike traditional paratexts, are not always
literally visible as part of the legible textual surface: their
"strategy" and "pragmatics" operate through the representational
and performative mechanisms of the digital interface. In print,
the paratext has (despite its marginality) a certain visible
presence on the page: its meaning may be wholly in relation to
the text it supports, but it is not different in kind from that text
(Tomasi 2005). The digital paratexts we are describing,
however, occupy a different stratum and have a different kind
of visibility and functional effect. Their presence may be felt
primarily in what the text does or in how we discover it, rather
than in the words we see when we read it. Their separateness
is demarcated through markup, which not only creates a
boundary between text and paratext but also makes the paratext
into a space of function and behavior: of meaning instantiated
through action rather than simply through textual signification.
In this respect, these categories of paratext (and in particular
the last, which is the realm of markup proper) are analogous to
the punctuation, formatting, and presentational conventions
through which a printed text is realized for a reader, or through
which an oral text is concretized in print. As Genette observes,
any transcription, including the written transcription of an oral
speech, is a form of paratext, and we can usefully extend this
idea to digital forms by observing that any encoding—in effect,
any transmediation—constitutes a form of paratext as well.

Digital Humanities 2007
Each of the three categories above illustrates a distinctive
dimension of the digital paratext, and raises a set of questions
and issues that can help us reach a clearer understanding of the
role of markup and the nature of digital texts. If we consider
markup in Genette’s terms as a “privileged space” of “action”
and “pragmatics”, what effect does this have on our
understanding of text encoding as a transcriptional activity? To
what extent do our disciplinary expectations about documentary
evidence run counter to the logic implied by these terms? The
boundary between transcription and authoring (and our sense
of where the distinction lies) may turn out to be harder to pin
down than has previously been suggested.
Similarly, to what extent does metadata operate as an active,
rather than a passive component of the textual ecology? If we
understand metadata creation as part of the authoring of the
digital document, does this change our sense of who should be
creating it and what its sources should be?
Finally, if schemas and stylesheets can also be understood as
paratexts (for instance, as suggested in Pierazzo 2006), then
we need to rethink our conception of textual meaning and
rhetoric to include not only the forms a text actually takes, but
also those which its constraints permit it to take: in other words,
the potential as well as actual forms through which we
apprehend the text.

T

he Voyage of the Slave Ship Sally is a digital project
developed as part of the work of Brown University's
Steering Committee on Slavery and Justice, which in 2003 was
formed to investigate the university's historical relationship to
slavery and the slave trade. The committee's research included
working with archival materials from the John Carter Brown
Library and the John Hay Library at Brown University. A
significant subset of these materials concerned a single slave
voyage conducted by John and Nicholas Brown in the 1760s,
for which a large amount of documentary evidence survives,
including ship's manifests, invoices and receipts, letters, bills
of lading, and the captain's trade book. The Brown University
Scholarly Technology Group (STG) worked with Professor
James Campbell, chair of the committee, and Patrick Yott,
director of the Center for Digital Initiatives, to develop a
resource through which these documents could be read and
explored.
The goal of the project was to present these materials in a digital
form that would respond to the committee's expressed goal to
"help the campus and the nation reflect on the meaning of this
history in the present, on the complex historical, political, legal,
and moral questions posed by any present-day confrontation
with past injustice." The project thus presented a number of
challenges: the breadth of audience, the need to engage readers
with widely varying levels of familiarity with the historical
background, and the need to offer as many ways as possible of
engaging with and probing these materials, so that they would
yield the maximum possible insight into the social, political,
historical, cultural, and economic circumstances surrounding
the slave trade. The initial version of the site, which was
released concurrently with the committee's report, emphasizes
access to the primary source documents through page images
Page 61

Digital Humanities 2007
and TEI transcriptions. The second phase of the project's
development, which will be completed by the end of 2007, will
provide more detailed forms of access through specialized
interface tools that draw on additional contextual data being
developed by the project faculty.
This poster and demonstration focuses on three areas of
particular significance arising from this project:
1. The interface design, which emphasized ways of engaging
readers of all skill and education levels and providing them
with contextual information needed to interact meaningfully
with the primary source documents
2. The management of interconnections between TEI
transcriptions, metadata, images, and contextual data, which
support a set of exploratory tools.
3. The exploratory tools themselves, which encourage readers
to probe the historical sources and their context in ways that
go beyond the authoritative information provided by the
site itself.

Interface design

O

ne of the central premises guiding the project's design
was the fact that we were anticipating readers in two
broad categories: those familiar with the historical context who
would be immediately interested in exploring the primary source
documents and able to make some sense of them, and those
coming to the site with no prior knowledge, who might have
no initial interest in the documents at all and no way of
exploring them meaningfully. Readers in the former group
would need powerful tools to allow them to probe the
documents, while those in the latter group would need a more
narrative interface emphasizing the historical context and its
modern significance, and providing readers with a sense of why
the primary source documents constitute an important
intellectual resource. The interface is designed with the aim of
leading all readers, eventually, to the documents via links from
the historical narrative to the relevant documentary material,
but it also provides readers with search and exploration tools
that embody as much contextual information as possible:
glossed timelines and maps, social networks of people, and lists
of commodities involved in the slave trade, all drawn from the
information carried in the primary source documents
themselves.

Data Structures

T
•

he documents and contextual information are represented
through a set of interrelated data structures, specifically:

TEI transcriptions of the primary source documents

Page 62

•
•
•

digital images of each document at a variety of resolutions
METS records representing the structure of each digital
object
a set of simple XML data structures to represent four
categories of contextual information on persons, places,
events, and commodities named in the texts, to allow for
glosses and information about the interconnections between
items in these groups (such as social networks, family
relationships, classifications of commodities, and so forth).
The TEI transcriptions capture a comparatively large amount
of information about the documents' content, by encoding
all references to persons, places, commodities, and financial
transactions so that these can be indexed, glossed,
regularized, and searched. The transcriptions use this
encoding to reference the contextual information, using
key= attributes which point to the relevant records
describing the person, place, event, or commodity in
question. This allows both for basic hooks to allow (for
instance) links to glosses directly from the text, and also
for more advanced exploratory tools which process this
information and represent it through visualizations and
advanced search mechanisms.

Exploratory tools

T

he primary source documents for the Sally project are
often individually compelling, but they are most
significant when understood as part of a social and economic
network. The existence of this network, however, can only be
grasped indirectly and fragmentarily through the documents
themselves; the reader needs tools for exploration that allow
patterns and connections to become visible, and that can draw
on the contextual information provided. When completed the
project will include a set of interface tools that facilitate
precisely this kind of exploration. For instance, the reader will
be able to explore the network of people and social relations
that surround the Sally voyage and inhabit its documentary
record--owners, captain, seamen, outfitters, workmen,
employees, enslaved Africans, slave traders. Their documentary
relationships (for instance, the senders and receivers of letters
and invoices) will be visible along with all of the metadata
about those exchanges (place and date of writing, type of
document, etc.) so that readers can construct a detailed and
vivid picture of the vectors of communication through which
this voyage is documented. Similarly detailed information
supports the exploration of the commodities described in these
documents, both those that were explicitly traded for slaves
(rum, cloth, iron bars), and those that were structurally essential
to the trade (weapons, sugar, the ship's provisions).
Visualization tools such as word clouds, manipulable
representations of networks, and generated timelines will give
readers a variety of ways to explore this information in ways

Digital Humanities 2007
that allow an overall grasp of the landscape as well as direct
connections to the documentary evidence at every point.

Round Table: Coalition of Digital
Humanities Centers

Conclusions

B

ecause the collection of documents associated with the
Sally voyage is comparatively small (on the order of a
hundred or so), the greatest informational value was to be gained
by an emphasis on detail (through the encoding of the
transcriptions) and on contextual information (through the
associated XML data structures that represent ontological
relationships between the various persons, commodities, and
so forth). This kind of approach is uncommon for collections
of historical documents, which characteristically emphasize
scale (consider for instance the Valley of the Shadow, or the
Making of America projects). Using visualization tools to model
and interact with information of this type is also comparatively
rare; visualization tools are being increasingly used for
exploration of very large data sets (often not encoded in XML
at all) but are less common for small, heavily tagged document
collections. This project thus offers opportunities for an
exploration of digital methods which may yield some useful
results at its conclusion--in particular, on the question of how
much value is added by detailed markup and tools that exploit
it.

he members of the panel will discuss with the audience
the outcome of the national summit meeting of American
digital humanities centers and major funders held at the National
Endowment of Humanities headquarters on April 12-13,
co-sponsored by the NEH and the University of Maryland.
The purpose of the meeting was to take seriously the ACLS
Cyberinfrastructure Commission’s call for digital humanities
centers to become key nodes of cyberinfrastructure in the United
States. To that end, the summit explored how best to foster
collaboration among national digital humanities centers, among
major funders of the digital humanities, and between centers
and funders, along with the possibility of creating a national
coalition of digital humanities centers.
Among the salient issues are the creation of mechanisms for
promoting timely exchange of information between centers and
identifying opportunities for collaboration among them; the
articulation of mutual research goals as well as particular areas
of emphases so as to avoid duplication of effort among centers;
the development of joint policy agendas and successful
strategies for pursuing them; better articulating funding needs
to funding agencies; methods for optimizing collaborative
opportunities between humanities content specialists and the
technological community; and advancing the place of the digital
humanities on campus, including such issues as infrastructure
and the role of the Digital Humanities in promotion and tenure.
This roundtable session will focus upon the initiatives begun
at the summit meeting and engage in a general discussion about
them, with the hope of widening the conversation to include

Extracting Stylistic Distances
from Texts for Forensic
Linguistics Purposes

he paper proposes a method for the automatic processing
of forensic texts for the extraction of similarities and
dissimilarities to be used for authorship identification purposes.
Forensic Linguistics expresses the application of linguistics to
the analysis of forensic language in written or oral form, the
study of the language of the law, the study of legal interpretation
and translation, the alleviation of disadvantage produced by
language in legal processes, the provision of forensic linguistic
evidence and of linguistic expertise in issues of legal drafting
and interpretation (Conley & O’Barr, 1998; Shy 1998; Cotterill,
2002; McMenamin & Dongdoo 2002; Semino & Culpeper,
2002; Gibbons, 2003). Our forensic texts belong to a Greek
terrorist organization, “17 November” (Kassimeris, 1997;
Παπαχελάς & Τέλλογλου, 2002; Frantzi, 2004). 17N started
its action in 1975, while the summer/autumn of 2002, all (or
most) of the members were arrested. The case is currently in
court for the second time. 84 of the proclamations, that used to
follow a 17N attack, have been characterized as genuine
(Κάκτος, 2002). Their authorship is an open issue. The final
aim of this project is to map each of the 17N proclamations to
its possible author (Frantzi & Ananiadou, 2006). In this work
we propose a way to characterise an organization’s text, i.e.
proclamation, pleading, replication, by values on its stylistic
characteristics. The values are used for extracting similarities
and dissimilarities among texts.
We consider the following stylistics features: the average
sentence and word length, the number of different nouns, proper
nouns, adjectives, active voice verbs, passive voice verbs,
adverbs, the number of future tense references, the use of
conjunctions, preposition, pronouns, particles, determiners,
articles, question words, punctuation, content words. For each
pair of possibly owned by the same author writings, we create
a matrix which we call distance-matrix (Table 1). Each cell of
the matrix contains a number that corresponds to a stylistic
feature distance between the two writings.

Digital Humanities 2007
“μα”. Table 2 gives the frequencies of occurrence and
normalized frequencies (to 10,000 words) for the five particles
found in Yotopoulos’s pleading (Yp) and replication (Yr) and
those in Koufodinas’s replication (Kr).

In order to compute the distance-matrix for a pair of writings,
we need to assign a value to each cell that corresponds to a
particular stylistic feature. This value gives the difference
(distance) between the two writings regarding the specific
feature. Then the distance between the two writings is evaluated
by the average value of all the feature-distances in the
distance-matrix. A feature-distance is assigned to a cell and is
calculated by the average of all phenomena distances for that
feature. The phenomena distances for a feature are calculated
by their normalized frequencies of occurrence in the two
writings. The algorithm for the processing of the
feature-distances is the following:

Each author is characterized by his/her pleadings and
replications. If we could match a proclamation to a pleading
(and replication) then we could possibly match a proclamation
to the corresponding author. We need to compare all pleadings
(and replications) to the proclamations, to find the smallest
“distance” in terms of their feature values. The smallest distance
assigns a proclamation to a pleading, i.e. an author.
In this work we apply the distance-table method for
comparisons between the pleadings and replications: we already
know the authors of the pleadings and proclamations, so we
can present how the distance-table works. We apply the method
to three writings: one pleading and two replications. Let us
consider Yotopoulos’s (the person accused to be the main leader
and one of the main authors of the proclamations) pleading of
18321 words, and replication of 2036 words, and Koufontinas’s
(also accused to be a leading member) replication of 326 words.
We will evaluate the distance-matrix for the pairs of writings
(Yotopoulos’s pleading, Yotopoulos’s replication) and
(Yotopoulos’s pleading, Koufontinas’s replication). We will
show the evaluation for one of the cells of the two
distance-matrixes, the distance-matrix[1,1], i.e. the cell that
keeps the distance regarding the stylistic feature of the particles’
use, while the evaluation is analogous for the rest of the cells.1
There are five particles in Greek: “να”, “για”, “θα”, “ας” and

The distance-matrix[1,1] cell for the (Yotopoulos’s pleading,
Yotopoulos’s replication) distance-matrix holds the distance
regarding the use of particles. We evaluate the distance on the
use of each of the five particle between the two writings and
we assign to the distance-matrix1,1] cell the average of all the
particles’ distances. Then we do the same for the
distance-matrix1,1] cell of the (Yotopoulos’s pleading,
Koufodinas’s replication) distance-matrix. The particles’
distances for the particle “να” for the two pair of writings are
calculated according the above-given algorithm as:The
distance-matrix[1,1] cell for the (Yotopoulos’s pleading,
Yotopoulos’s replication) distance-matrix holds the distance
regarding the use of particles. We evaluate the distance on the
use of each of the five particle between the two writings and
we assign to the distance-matrix[1,1] cell the average of all the
particles’ distances. Then we do the same for the
distance-matrix[1,1] cell of the (Yotopoulos’s pleading,
Koufodinas’s replication) distance-matrix. The particles’
distances for the particle “να” for the two pair of writings are
calculated according the above-given algorithm as:
Particles_distance(Yp,Yr)[να]=|245.619 - 294.695| / (245.619
+ 294.695)=0.091 Particles_distance(Yp,Κr)[να]=|245.619 122.699| / (245.619 + 122.699)=0.334
Table 3 gives the results of the calculations for all the particles’
distances for those pair of writings. We get the average for each
of the columns of Table 3, i.e. 0.289 and 0.409. These averages
will be assigned to distance-matrixes.[1,1] cells for the two
pairs of writings distance-matrixes.

When matrixes are filled up, we can evaluate the total distances
for the pairs of writings as the average of all the cell values:
matrix-distance(Yp, Kr)= 0.5593 matrix-distance (Yp,Yr)=
0.3382
As a result Yotopoulos’s pleading is linked to Yotopoulos’s
replication (smaller distance), which actually means that these
two writings have been found to be closer as for their language
style than the writings of Yotopoulos’s pleading and
Koufodinas’s replication.
Future work involves:
•

•
•
•

Augmentation of the distance-matrix with more stylistics
features, e.g. the use of collocations (Frantzi & Ananiadou,
2007),
use of weights for the stylistics features,
application of the method for characterizing the
proclamations for the provision of authorship evidence,
comparisons among the proclamations for their grouping
according to their linguistic profile.

D

uring the 16th- and 17th-centuries European seafaring
underwent an incredible transformation driven mainly
by the exploration of newly discovered lands, the contact with
previously unknown cultures, and the increase in maritime
commerce. The social changes that resulted from this cultural
revolution affected the long chain of events entailed by the
construction of oceangoing ships and determined a number of
technical innovations in the construction of ships. From an
original oral tradition, where apprentices learned from masters
the intricacies of shipbuilding techniques; this process evolved
into a more formal field as masters began to follow guidelines,
materials used, and construction sequences in a more systematic
way, forming a corpus of information that was soon compiled
in manuscripts known as shipbuilding treatises.
The first shipbuilding treatises, understandably, were written
by mathematicians, priests and other learned men, reflecting a
reality where shipbuilders probably were largely illiterate. Rich
in technical descriptions, shipbuilding treatises play a key role
in Nautical Archaeology both for scholars and students. Scholars
access these manuscripts for several reasons. For example,
working on the reconstruction of sunken ships, they can provide
vital information for reassembling fragments and damaged
timbers of ship remains recovered from underwater excavations.
Also, their contents often help our understanding of shipbuilding
techniques. In addition, they can be used to compare different
construction traditions both from geographical and
chronological standpoints. Moreover, they are great sources

for understanding the evolution of shipbuilding (Figure 2 shows
our treatises browser).
Nautical Archaeology students—although not carrying out the
complex tasks of ship reconstruction—are exposed to treatises
early in their studies. For them treatises are a good source to
understand the basic terminology and concepts they will be
using during the rest of their studies. Current teaching practices
are constrained to browse physical copies of the original
sources; with obvious restrictions such as limited number of
copies and access, or unknown language—depending of their
provenance, they were written in different languages, and
difficult technical terminology. In fact, treatises inherit most
of the limitations of printed books.
Providing ways in which shipbuilding treatises can be used
digitally by both scholars and students is an attractive
interdisciplinary effort for a number of reasons. First, is the
opportunity to investigate the variety of ways in which
manuscripts’ contents (both texts and illustrations) can be
structured and classified. Second, is the opportunity to make
original-source material available at the location of an
excavation; the treatises description of the construction of the
physical objects can provide valuable information about
fragments of ship timbers that are recovered from an excavation
site. This effort clearly draws techniques from the earlier
projects in the digital humanities that examine the characteristics
of digital representations of paper-based texts. However the
linkage to physical artifacts opens up additional possibilities
and considerations.
Digital humanities projects involving manuscripts or printed
texts have been related, for the most part, to literature and
historical records; some Know: Responding to the
Computational Transformation of the well-known examples
include the Canterbury Tales Project.1, the Rossetti Archive2,
and the Perseus Digital Library 3. We have been involved in
creating collections of this form as well for Cervantes4,Donne,5
and Picasso6. In the context of Nautical Archaeology, the
manuscript of Michael of Rhodes captures the knowledge
obtained by this 15th century seaman during his 4- decade-long
career7. The presentation of the manuscript, oriented to a general
audience, hints at the value that such materials will have to the
professional archaeologist when representations and tools are
provided that meet his scholarly needs.
Until relatively recently, ships were the most advanced and
complex transportation means designed. Nautical treatises hold
the key to understanding their technical complexity. In essence,
the collection of treatises represents the technical manuals
describing the components, their use, and the steps taken in
manufacturing of the ship. Several characteristics of treatises
make understanding them a very challenging task. Language
is a major problem; in order to better understand their contents,
it is necessary to provide translations and explanations of
Page 67

Digital Humanities 2007
concepts, pieces, and sequences. Beyond the multiple languages
in which the treatises were written, they also come from diverse
geographical locations and span centuries, making terms,
concepts, and descriptions difficult to understand. Different
units and standards of measurement—a key aspect in technical
descriptions—raise problems about not only comparing treatises
with different provenance, but also translating them into modern
scales; units of measurement used in the treatises are not
necessarily the ones used by archaeologists to measure
recovered evidence. To tackle these problems, we have
developed a multilingual glossary, in which terms include their
corresponding translation and definition into ten languages
(which can be expanded as needed). The incorporation of
“roles,” enables us to expand characteristics related to the terms,
for example spellings and synonyms. Our framework allows
multiple values per role as well the addition of more roles as
they are required (see figure 1).
However, despite common features shared by physical
fragments and their corresponding descriptions in the texts,
fragments obtained from individual ships have important
differences because of the differing physical conditions that
they have been exposed to. Damaged and incomplete ship
remains require the adoption of an encoding scheme to describe
and quantify uncertainty; textual descriptions do not encompass
“uncertainty.”
In the previous paragraphs we have briefly outlined the
relationship between physical archaeological evidence and
written descriptions in the treatises. However, treatises in
themselves have properties that make them unique. For
example, an important question is how similar or different are
treatises in terms of the sequences, construction techniques,
and materials used. An initial approach would suggest that
probably the encoding used in their description could be used
to quantify the degree of similarity.
Since treatises are “technical manuals,” illustrations are essential
in their understanding; therefore, we adopted a two-step process.
First, illustrations have to be segmented, an illustration Ij, can
be composed of a set of components C = {c1, c2,… ck}, where
a component ci has a list of properties P = {p1, p2 …pk}.
Second, each component might have a description within the
text, thus a linkage between the two is required. To make things
more complex, a component cj can be formed from a subset of
components, a step that resembles a recursive property, where
the ship as a whole is formed by small parts, which in turn are
composed by smaller ones, and so on. Figure 3 depicts the
interface for capturing coordinates in images linking them to
terms from the glossary.
Conversely, components can be mapped to other
representations; a good example is a model created in 3D
rendering software such as Rhino. We have done preliminary
tests, exporting geometric data from Rhino models into XML
Page 68

and linking them to both 2D slides of the model and their
corresponding occurrences in the treatises.
Although linking text and images has been extensively studied;
the context of treatises raises a series of complex issues. For
example, the text of a treatise could be segmented in a variety
of ways based on different needs; assemblage sequences,
materials used, and section of the ship being described. This in
turn raises some interesting questions, for example: could the
components being included in part of the text give a hint of
what that section is about, or what section of the ship it
describes? How could components in different treatises be
compared?
Our current collection includes digital images and transcriptions
of three of the most relevant late 16th and early 17th century
Portuguese treatises: 8 Fernando Oliveira’s Livro da Fabrica
das Naos (dated to 1580), João Baptista Lavahna’s Livro
Primeiro da Architectura Naval9 (dated between 1608 and
1615), and Manoel Fernandez’s Livro de Tracas de Carpintaria
(dated to 1616). We expect to add more manuscripts as
permissions from holders are granted.
The treatises’ dual role as historically-significant text and as
formal specification of elements of ship design affords an
opportunity to investigate the relationship of techniques
developed within the context of textual studies to applications
with physical objects and virtual 3D models. Further, the
treatises provide the foundation for our development of the
Nautical Archaeology Digital Library (<http://nadl.ta
mu.edu/>), which will center on providing resources in
support of archaeologists’ work and on dissemination of
expedition artifacts10. The combination holds promise of
extending the reach of the digital humanities.

Digitization and Publication of
the Goethe-Dictionary on the
Internet
Kurt Gärtner (gaertnek@staff.uni-marburg.de)
University of Trier, Germany
Vera Hildenbrandt (hildenbr@uni-trier.de)
University of Trier, Germany

The Goethe Dictionary(Goethe Wörterbuch = GWb) is one of
the most ambitious projects in German lexicography. Its
importance for literary and linguistic research on the writings
of the most famous German author Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe (1749-1832) can not be overestimated. Although still
a work in progress – hitherto four volumes (A—inhaftieren)
have been completed – the GWb has become an essential tool
not only for the study of the wide ranging vocabulary of an
individual author, but also – due to the enormous influence of
this author – an indispensable instrument for research on the
history of the German language and culture during one of the
key periods of their development. The vocabulary of Goethe
comprises about 90.000 words, more than any other writer in
German has ever used, because he not only wrote as a poet, but
was also engaged in serious research in fields like anatomy,
geology and botany; and in addition to that he served as a
minister to the court of Weimar and was well familiar with all
aspects of the administrative language of his time.
The preparation of the GWb began shortly after the 2nd world
war in 1947, the 1st volume appeared in 1978, the second
instalment of the 5th volume (Jammernachbar—kanonieren)
in 2005. In 2003 plans were developed for the creation of a
digital version of the GWb which so far had been published
only in a printed form. A grant proposal for the digitization had
been drawn up by the Competence Centre for Electronic
Retrieval and Publication Methods in the Humanities
(Kompetenzzentrum für elektronische Erschließungs- und
Publikationsverfahren) at the University of Trier in
collaboration with the Interacademic Committee for the Goethe
Dictionary of three German Academies of Sciences and
Humanities (Berlin-Brandenburg, Göttingen, Heidelberg).
After receiving a grant from the German Research Association
(Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) the digitization project
started in May 2004 at the University of Trier. By end of 2005
the first 3 volumes were made freely available on the internet
(<http://www.gwb.uni-trier.de>) in a preliminary
Page 70

version which has been refined in the following time
considerably. In future the GWb will continue to be published
in print, but will be also made freely available on the Internet
in a version which is closely related to the printed form with
its stable references for reliable quotations. Conservative
Goethe-scholars with their prejudices towards the new media
may quote the book, although their secretaries got the quotations
from the digital version. It is therefore essential that the digitized
version is an absolutely correct rendering of the printed version
and offers the same degree of reliability. However, the Internet
version will offer much more than the book with its restriction
caused by the procrustean bed of its alphabetical macrostructure:
Via a comfortable and user-friendly interface, the electronic
GWb is to provide flexible and innovative possibilities for
literary and linguistic research on Goethe and the history of the
German language and its vocabulary as well as for everyone
interested in Goethe and the language of his time, both in
Germany and abroad. The following short description of the
digitization project will outline the main features of its
innovative approach to making the informational potential of
a traditional dictionary fully available. The various steps of the
project will be described in detail in the proposed paper.
The first task in the project’s working plan consisted of a minute
analysis of all the typographical features of the microstructure
of an entry in order to draw up a carefully organised set of
instructions or functional specifications (Pflichtenheft) for the
typists who should be enabled to apply appropriate tags related
to the specific typographical functions. This preliminary tagging
is done by the typist during his keying in the text of an entry;
it saves a considerable amount of time in a later stage of the
project when XML/TEI conformant markup is applied.
The text of the GWb has been made machine readable via
double keying, a method strongly recommended by Wilhelm
Ott and successfully practised in previous lexicographical
projects of the Trier Competence Centre, e.g. the Middle High
German Dictionaries Interlinked (Mittelhochdeutsche
Wörterbücher im Verbund), <http://www.MWV.uni-tr
ier.de>, and the digitization of the 33 vols. of the Deutsches
Wörterbuch by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, <http://www.
DWB.uni-trier.de>, the German equivalent to the OED.
The idea of scanning the GWb and using OCR software for
processing the data had been excluded from the beginning,
because of the highly specialised typography and the far too
time-consuming and costly correction processes afterwards.
The data input took place in China. Two teams were capturing
the GWb in MS-Word via double keying and using
TUSTEP-tags for encoding the typographical features and the
special characters. After the transfer of the data to Germany
via e-mail, the data were converted into the TUSTEP-format.
The two versions were collated automatically by
TUSTEP-routines; TUSTEP also generated a list of differences,
which has been corrected manually after comparing the printed

Digital Humanities 2007
GWb. The result of this step was an error-free TUSTEP-version
of the GWb.
Apart from fulltext retrieval, the TUSTEP-version already offers
a number of other searches, but it is difficult to perform
combined queries without further markup. For this step the
TEI-Guidelines were used; they were not followed always
strictly, some deviations were necessary to suit the specialities
of the microstructure of a GWb-entry. Because of the huge
amount of data, the XML/TEI-conformant markup had to be
inserted by using automatic routines wherever possible. For
this we used again TUSTEP-modules which proved to work
efficiently and with an outmost degree of accuracy.
The XML/TEI-encoded data were stored in a data base and a
graphical user interface was developed using several tools and
methods which we had used for the previous lexicographical
projects and which have been described elsewhere in detail by
Thomas Burch (<http://aspn.activestate.com/A
SPN/Tcl/TclConferencePapers2002/Tcl2002pa
pers/>).
The contribution will present a detailed introduction to the user
interface and the functionalities of the electronic GWb. We
took great pains to display the GWb in a way that makes it
attractive and easy to use. Unlike other digital dictionaries
(OED, TLF) we did not allow to break up the macrostructure
in single entries separately shown (one screen = one entry), but
kept the structure of the printed dictionary thus allowing a
comfortable overview over series of compounds beginning with
the same determinative. The framing of the window allows an
easy navigation especially through long entries with an
elaborated hierarchical microstructure, thus helping the user to
find as quickly as possible what he is looking for. – As the
project is still a work in progress, the presenting author would
gladly discuss the perspectives of what remains to be done.

Introduction

A

mong mankind’s priceless treasures are not only
handmade artefacts but also creations reflecting
mankind’s ability of thinking and speaking. These are texts.
Thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of
manuscripts created during the past thousands years that reached
our days are of great historic, artistic and cultural value. There
is no doubt that written texts were and remain one of the most
valuable witnesses of the past of mankind, its achievements
and discoveries, world view, sufferings and errors.
It is well known that natural human language and texts in natural
language, accordingly, are among the most complicated things
for study and interpretation. The complexity increases several
times for old texts.
One of the most effective means of preserving and increasing
knowledge of old texts is the steady philological, historical and
textual study of and commentary on them using the manuscripts.
Unfortunately, the major part of the world manuscript heritage
is in need of the comprehensive study. Many manuscripts are
unpublished and inaccessible.

Objectives

U

p-to-date computer technologies offer wide possibilities
for preservation, processing, study and popularisation of
the manuscript cultural heritage of mankind. The most
promising method of comprehensive study of manuscripts is
the creation of digital libraries in the form of full-text databases.
The advantages of this type of collection are the volume of
stored information, speedy search, advanced data retrieval and
ordering functionality, the ability to supplement the database
with new information and the ability to access it through the
Internet

Page 71

Digital Humanities 2007
The weaknesses of full-text databases are their complexity and
the expenditure of labour required to access the manuscript/text
and its components. The depth of fragmentation, number and
composition of units, their properties and values all must be
determined beforehand, so the text is considerably simplified
and the means of establishing relationships between fragments
can be absent.

6. work with unit dictionaries, their properties and values and
relationships (Figure 4);
7. support for simultaneous work with several manuscripts;
8. multi-user support.

While developing the Manuscript system 1 (<http://manu
scripts.ru/index_en.html>) intended for storage,
processing and publication of ancient manuscripts, the research
group of philologists and programmers at Udmurtia State
University developed a unique module for accessing the full-text
database: a specialised text editor called OldEd. Its distinctive
feature is its combination of the functions of traditional text
processors with their visual presentation of text and formatting
capabilities, with the ability to build a corresponding
object-oriented database for each textual unit, which can be
combined into relationship hierarchies.
As is well known, text processors like Microsoft Word are well
suited to extension using their powerful object model and
therefore provide a means of interaction with databases as an
interface to it (in this case, with full-text databases of ancient
texts). However an analysis of such a means of interacting with
the database using Microsoft Word showed that the
development of our own tools for editing Old Russian texts
stored in the database would be considerably less
labour-consuming than customizing Microsoft Word or other
software

Figure 1: : Many texts, many languages and accurate reproduction of glyphs

Methodology

T

o work with data stored in full-text databases, it is
advisable to create special editors. In the process of
developing the OldEd editor, our research group was guided
by the following requirements:
1. creation, input and editing of the document through direct
interaction with the database;
2. representation of the manuscript text in a form that would
be close to the original, including reproduction of glyph
variants (Figure 1);
3. selection and creation of the manuscript/text units and
manipulation of their properties and values (Figure 2);
4. work with unit relationships (creation, change of
subordination, deletion, change of properties, visualization
of relationships);
5. work with various hierarchical structures (unit selection,
creation of the relationship with the parent unit etc.) and
representation of unit relationships in the hierarchy as a tree
(Figure 3);
Page 72

Figure 2: Text units, their properties and values

Figure 3: Text fragments and their dictionary equivalents

Digital Humanities 2007
and allows creation of new units (including texts). When
displaying relationships, the user can view and edit all unit
relationships.

Further steps

Figure 4: Hierarchic representation of units

Technological description

F

rom a technical point of view, the editor comprises a range
of components providing access to data, the ability to read
and record objects into the database, visualisation of the units
of the manuscripts/texts and their hierarchical relationships,
and representation of the document in the form of formatted
text.
The editor was written in C++, and the components were
developed with the use of ATL (Active Template Library). The
client part was written using MFC (Microsoft Foundation
Classes). In operation the client interacts with the database of
the Manuscript system by means of a server API-procedure
written as packages for the Oracle database management system.

Results and Business benefits

T

he smallest unit that can be operated on by the editor is
the glyph and its variants. The largest units are the
manuscript and text. It should be noted that the relationships
among the latter could be described by the notion ‘many to
many’: the manuscript can have many texts; one text can be
represented in many manuscripts.
The OldEd editor allows the user to work effectively with the
visualised data – units, their relationships, properties and values
– of texts/manuscripts. The editor enables representation of the
hierarchies existing in a text/manuscript and of the text as a
transformed geometrical hierarchy. When working with the
text, the editor allows the user to edit the text and divide it into
fragments. When scrolling, the editor displays information on
the relationships between the text units, structural units and
dictionary units; allows creation and deletion of relationships
between units; allows viewing and correction of their properties

•

he editor’s functional possibilities are being expanded in
several directions:

Since working with the editor currently requires a constant
connection with the database, it would be desirable to have
a feature allowing the user to download part of the document
and work with it offline.
The present version of the editor could be used with a direct
remote connection to the database, but this is not allowed
only for security reasons. This is why the database
management system is currently behind a firewall and
inaccessible from outside of the local network. This situation
should be changed, as the value of the system considerably
increases if many researchers can access it not only to
acquire information, but also to enrich the database. To
achieve this goal, a new additional web interface to data
using the SOAP protocol should be developed. Information
on the ancient hand-written treasures stored in the database
is already accessible through a special web-interface in
viewing mode (as an illustration see our site devoted to the
Putyata’s Menaion manuscript <http://manuscript
s.ru/mns/portal.main?p1=19&p_lid=2&p_si
d=1>).

Conclusions

T

he editor provides features for working with full-text
databases: the text/manuscript and their units are
represented in a view that is close to the original; the
text/manuscript can be divided into fragments described by
their respective properties and values; units belonging to the
same content area can be organized in a hierarchy; any unit can
have a standard variant (corresponding dictionary unit);
relationships can be established between any units (even distant
ones); and editing of units, their properties, values and
relationships can be done by the user directly in the text. In
other words, the digital copy of the manuscript/text can be
represented not like a linear chain of units, but like a complex
network, each part of which is a model of a certain area of
information in the manuscript. All editor features are intended,
first of all, so that versatile operations can be performed on
manuscripts/texts for further processing of them in the
databases, preparation of reference materials and creation of
printed and digital editions.

One of the most important advantages of the editor is that it
allows simple, consistent visual manipulation of the various
units of structurally complex manuscripts and texts so that users
do not need to learn difficult markup languages

his presentation describes the principal humanities
application of a recent grant project that used
Geographical Information Systems (GIS). It explores the
institutional context in which the project took place, curricular
and survey results, implications for faculty development using
a GIS tool in the humanities, and a glimpse at where the project
is leading in the study of language, literature and culture. A
GIS methodology we used allowed us to map statistical
information to make visible what might otherwise have been
merely a matrix of numeric data. It allowed us to distinguish
meaningful patterns. We have found that when the data come
to bear upon historical, political or sociological situations, they
can have an impact upon the study of language, culture and
even literature, thus the humanities. Such was the premise of
our project, the International Studies/Language Technology
Initiative, funded by three American philanthropic foundations
from 1999-2002, the Culpeper Foundation, the Archbold
Charitable Trust, and the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.1
Our GIS initiative focused on International Studies, Sociology,
and Modern Languages and Literatures. We sought to improve
our own analytical skills across disciplinary divisions as a model
for our students and to promote foreign languages across the
curriculum (FLAC).2 For French and Spanish, we introduced
maps into the curriculum, combined maps with data sets, and
encouraged students to answer questions in the foreign language
using these materials, which involved relatively simple but
relevant statistics that usually had an historical or a sociological
context.
The first level consisted of faculty development, followed by
the creation and pilot application of interactive maps to help
students fill significant gaps in their knowledge of geography,
where they could work in pairs or small groups to discuss clues
about a country’s characteristics or location, then click on the
area within the borders to reveal the name and see if they were
correct. This approach eventually led to the creation of
multimedia GIS maps where the name of the country, capital
city or other regions would be pronounced and where other
multimedia materials such as digital video with subtitles or
captioning would appear to assist language learners (Figures 1

Digital Humanities 2007
and 2, originally in color).3 The multimedia tagging of maps
using a proprietary GIS tool, MapInfo, allowed us to experiment
with a kind of hypertext and hypermedia suggested by Vannevar
Bush’s article “As We May Think” (Atlantic Monthly, July
1945, 101-108) and which have been explored by countless
other researchers for a host of applications. We are currently
investigating the viability of non- proprietary GIS tools such
as QGIS and Google Earth applications.
In our project, we created some maps that showed change in
demographic or other features over time, others that showed
local, regional, national, and transnational patterns in trade, use
of resources, socio-demographics and politics. Several of these
custom-designed GIS maps will be shown at the presentation.
Faculty anecdotally concluded that this work enhanced students’
ability to read tables, recognize spatial data, read maps, and use
the computer as an analytical tool, not just a word processor,
e-mailing device, or means to browse the Internet.
When applied to studies and classes in modern languages and
literatures, we developed pedagogies to encourage analytical
and critical thinking. One successful application was to pair
this author’s French Translation class (FR 265) with a class in
Urban/Suburban Sociology (SO 163) on several occasions,
where the latter’s students were charged with a task that is far
from trivial, one that Martyn Jessop in the 2006 ADHO
conference identified: “The number of digital datasets is
growing rapidly and these are often of interest to researchers
in fields other than the often highly specialised one that the
data was originally derived for but how does one locate them?”
(Digital Humanities 2006, p. 101). The task in our case was a
“mapquest” activity to find French census data that would allow
both the French Translation and anglophone Sociology classes
to analyze patterns of North African demographics in France.
These results were applied to the discussion in another French
class reading short selections from francophone North African
literature and about the political situation in France. The
presentation will more fully describe the survey results, partially
illustrated in Figure 4, based on the students’ responses to
questions concerning the team activity and their learning.
Applications of these maps to the study of French language and
culture and francophone literature come into focus when one
“zooms” into a region, city, Parisian arrondissement (district)
and neighborhood and how it actually looks, much as Stendhal
zoomed in on the little town of Verrières in the first chapter of
Le rouge et le noir (1830). Our project constantly strove to put
a human face on what might otherwise have simply been an
aerial photo or a map showing colorful patterns. Zooming in
on the La Glacière métro stop in Paris through French census
data yields one sense of the community. Another one emerges
when one views the neighborhood from street level and watches
a documentary clip on street basketball (Figure 1).4

An historical example includes a GIS map of the population
density in the Paris region which surprised us as an illustration
compatible with the Concentric Zone Theory proposed by the
Chicago School of Ernest Burgess, Robert Parks and others in
the 1920’s.5 The results of the French policy of centralization
start to become clear from this perspective by using a map that
shows contrasts in population (Figure 3, originally in color).
This map and similar ones have sparked student discussions of
the differences in schooling between the United States and
France, of the relative sizes of cities, and other conversations
that have yielded a good number of “aha” moments. The
complexity of these thoughts and their expression depend upon
the students’ language level. However, students starting with
the second year of university French study have been able to
grasp and discuss the implications of “L’Etat, c’est moi” for
the general French population under Louis XIV, a statement
that presaged the migratory movement that would lead
approximately one quarter of the entire French population to
live within a forty-four-mile (seventy-one-kilometer) radius
starting from the center of Paris (Figure 3).
GIS tools have allowed us to create maps that help answer
sociodemographic and other questions that might never have
been asked. These new products have made visible certain
patterns that would otherwise have been hidden in census and
other data (Figure 4, originally in color). This presentation
shares the background, materials and procedures by which the
project was created and has been sustained in several disciplines
since 1999. To our knowledge, no creation of similar materials
for French and Sociology had been created.6
Further work will involve the collection of authentic materials
by U.S. students on study abroad in France and by faculty
members. The new materials will include interviews with
residents whose lives may already span various generations,
photographs linked to GPS coordinates, historical documents,
and current realia. These authentic materials will be integrated
into language acquisition curricula as well as higher-level
courses by faculty in our French program in the proof of concept
phase. One prospective benefit is the encouragement of study
abroad as students become much more familiar with the people,
sounds, sights, arts, thoughts and sociological fabric of various
towns and cities in France. Quantitative and qualitative aspects
will provide students with a fuller ability to appreciate French
culture and civilization as well as give them the chance to work
with peers who do not have the linguistic background to access
the materials first hand. The results of a small-scale study of
such interaction (Figure 5, originally in color) suggest that
helping speakers of a foreign language add a GIS analytical
ability at the university level and in a career is an easier task
than the obverse, training users of GIS sufficiently in the foreign
language to allow them first-hand access to the foreign language
materials.

I

n his intriguing “All the Way Through: Testing for
Authorship in Different Frequency Strata”, John F. Burrows
follows up his much-discussed Delta (Burrows, 2002a, 2002b,
2003; Hoover 2004a, 2004b, 2006) with two new measures of
textual difference: Zeta and Iota (Burrows 2006; see also
Burrows 2005).
Both measures begin with a full word frequency list for a sample
of Restoration poetry (approximately 20,000 words) by a single
primary author. The sample is then divided into five sections
of equal size, and word frequency lists are created for them.
Zeta deals with words of moderate frequency, words occurring
in at least three of the five sections. To compare two poets, the
word list is reduced further by removing any occurring more
than three times in the second poet’s sample. Where many
authors are being compared, the list is reduced by removing
any words present in the text samples of most of the other
authors. Both methods remove from consideration the most
frequent words of English that have been the focus of so much
recent work. Whether there are two or many authors, the result
is a list of words that are moderately frequent in the primary
author but much less frequent in the other author(s).
For Iota, the word list is first limited to words appearing in at
most two of the primary author’s sections. To compare two
authors, the list is further limited to words that are completely
absent from the second author’s sample. Where many authors
are being compared, the list is further reduced by removing
words that appear in more than half the other authors. In either
case, very frequent and moderately frequent words are
eliminated, leaving words that are not very frequent in the
primary author but are rare or non-existent in the other author(s).
Zeta and Iota are remarkably effective in attributing poems as
short as 1,000 words to the correct authors. Even more
important, they allow the analyst to concentrate on a relatively
small subset of characteristic words, nearly all content words.
These lead back to the text and to important questions of
interpretation and style.
Both Zeta and Iota will require further testing before they can
be confidently applied to genuine questions of authorship and
Page 77

Digital Humanities 2007
style, and we can begin with a study of twentieth-century poetry.
For these tests my corpus consists of samples of 14,000 to
129,000 words of poetry by twenty-six poets as the primary set
and fifty-six independent poems from 900 to 21,000 words long
as the secondary set, thirty-six of these by poets in the primary
set and twenty by other poets (poems by primary authors are
removed from their main samples). The texts were downloaded
from Chadwyck-Healey’s Literature Online and edited to
regularize hyphens and to remove prose sections and
non-authorial text, such as publication information, notes,
section numbers, epigrams and other quotations. Delta tests
were used to determine which of the poems and poets are most
difficult to attribute, and these were analyzed using Zeta and
Iota.
My head-to-head tests of Wallace Stevens vs Archibald
MacLeish and Edwin Arlington Robinson vs Robert Frost give
even more definitive results than Burrows achieves for Marvell
vs Waller, though my much larger samples require minor
adjustments in technique). The new measures have no difficulty
distinguishing the two poets, whichever poet’s word list is used.
When Burrows tests Marvell and Waller (using each poet’s
own primary word list) against the samples and twenty-four
independent poems by twenty-four other main authors and
twenty-one poems by other authors, Iota works very well for
both authors, and Zeta works based on Waller’s list. Marvell’s
list produces a group of failures which Burrows suggests are
likely to be result from the contrast between the political satires
being tested and the largely pastoral nature of most of Marvell’s
poetry.
My tests using the primary word lists of eight different authors
yields strong results for Zeta on James Dickey, Vachel Lindsay,
Robert Frost, and Wallace Stevens, with all of their individual
poems ranking higher than any poem or sample by any other
author. Zeta is very successful on two of William Vaughn
Moody’s independent poems, but the third ranks far below
other author samples and individual poems, and it fails badly
when based on the word lists of Edwin Arlington Robinson,
Kenneth Rexroth, and Archibald MacLeish. For Iota, only the
lists of Stevens and Lindsay produce completely correct results,
though those of Moody and Rexroth produce good results except
for a single poem by each author. Further research into the
causes of these poorer results is underway, but the problems
with Iota may be related to my larger samples. (The definition
of “rare” is obviously very different for 20,000-word samples
and 120,000-word samples.)
One alteration of Zeta that produces perfect results using
Robinson’s word list not only limits the word list to words that
appear in at least three of the author’s five sections, but also
sets a lower limit on the word’s frequency in the main set and
limits the total frequency of the word in the twenty-five
counter-sets. Another, still under investigation, calculates the
Page 78

standard deviation of the word’s frequency in the five base
sections and divides it by the mean frequency. Sorting the word
list on the resulting Coefficient of Variation (or Relative
Standard Deviation) makes it easy to limit the list to words that
appear at relatively consistent frequencies in the five sections,
besides appearing in at least three of them and in a limited
number of the counter-set samples. A word appearing five times
in each of a poet’s five sections seems intuitively more
“characteristic” of the author than one appearing twenty-three
times in one section and once in each of two others.
Whatever the outcome of further testing and modification may
be, Zeta, especially, is very effective in focusing attention on
a poet’s characteristic words, a useful task in its own right. In
head-to-head tests on MacLeish and Stevens, much more
stringent stipulations than Burrows used produce fascinating
results: the twenty-six words occurring in all five sections of
MacLeish’s sample but with a frequency less than three in
Stevens’s sample are good potential MacLeish authorship
markers, and the same stipulations produce forty potential
Stevens authorship markers. These words range in rank within
their word lists from about the 200th to the 1,400th most
frequent. These two sets of marker words return our attention
to the texts:
Characteristic Stevens words rare in MacLeish:
reality, except, centre, element, colors, solitude, possible, ideas,
hymns, essential, imagined, nothingness, crown, inhuman,
motions, regard, sovereign, chaos, genius, glittering, lesser,
singular, alike, archaic, luminous, phrases, casual, voluble,
universal, autumnal, café, inner, reads, vivid, clearest, deeply,
minor, perfection, relation, immaculate
Characteristic MacLeish words rare in Stevens:
answered, knees, hope, ways, steep, pride, signs, lead, hurt,
sea’s, sons, vanish, wife, earth’s, lifted, they’re, swing, valleys,
fog, inland, catch, dragging, ragged, rope, strung, bark
Stevens’s words are longer and more abstract, especially the
nouns, and his list is saturated with adjectives. MacLeish’s list
has very few adjectives and more verbs and concrete nouns.
Searching for marker words in each poet’s work yields a
remarkable pair of short poems: MacLeish’s short poem
“‘Dover Beach’–A Note to that Poem” (215 words) contains
seven of his twenty-six marker words, including the three
italicized in this brief passage:
. . . It’s a fine and a
Wild smother to vanish in: pulling down--Tripping with outward ebb the urgent inward.
Speaking alone for myself it’s the steep hill and the
Toppling lift of the young men I am toward now . . .
In his even shorter poem, “From the Packet of Anacharsis”
(144 words), six of Stevens’s forty marker words appear,

Digital Humanities 2007
including the three italicized in this brief passage (internal
ellipsis in the original):
And Bloom would see what Puvis did, protest
And speak of the floridest reality . . .
In the punctual centre of all circles white
Stands truly. The circles nearest to it share
Its color . . .
Preventing the huge numbers of items being analyzed from
masking any meaningful results is one of the most difficult
challenges for quantitative analyses of literature. By selecting
for examination words that are particularly characteristic of an
author, Zeta and Iota are potentially very useful for literary
analysis as well as authorship attribution, no matter what further
refinements they may require.

Updating Delta and Delta Prime
David L. Hoover (david.hoover@nyu.edu)
New York University

J

ohn F. Burrows's Delta, a unitary measure of textual
difference, has created a flurry of interest in authorship
attribution and statistical stylistics since its introduction in 2001
(Burrows 2001, 2002a, 2002b, 2003, 2005; Hoover 2004b;
García and Martín 2006; other studies are in progress). Burrows
uses a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet to simplify and partially
automate his calculation of Delta, and I have presented
increasingly complex versions of The Delta Spreadsheet that
more fully automate the calculation and the analysis of results
(2004a, 2005a). I have also suggested possible improvements
in how Delta is calculated or defined, which I have tentatively
called “Delta Primes” (Hoover 2004c, 2005a, 2006).
The growing popularity of Delta analysis will surely lead to its
further increased use. In addition to a number of studies in
progress in the broad area of humanities computing, studies by
other researchers are either already ongoing or being planned
using Delta in the evaluation of high-stakes educational testing
of writing in high schools, in the “authorship” of film direction,
in evolutionary biology, and in studies of adverse drug reactions.
The simplicity of automated versions of Delta analysis is critical
to its increased use, especially for those who are not specialists
in authorship attribution or humanities computing.
In its current state, The Delta Spreadsheet allows the user to
paste in raw word frequency lists and then to perform a
complete Delta analysis automatically by running a Visual
Basic macro that calls other macros. One of the macros removes
any words from the word list that are not found in the primary
set of texts (the presence of such words would prevent the
calculation of Delta by causing division by zero). Another
macro changes the raw word frequencies into text percentages
and inserts a zero frequency record in the word list for each
text whenever any of the most frequent words does not occur
in that text. This process is extremely tedious, time-consuming,
and liable to error if done manually, especially on the large
word lists that are now typically used in Delta analysis
(800-4,000 words). Another optional macro removes personal
pronouns. These pronouns are entered into a column in the
spreadsheet, along with the master word list to be analyzed,
and the user also can enter there any other words that should
be eliminated (for example, noise words or proper names). The
spreadsheet also allows the user to specify whether the word
list should be culled to remove words for which a single text
Page 79

Digital Humanities 2007
provides most of the occurrences, and, if so, to specify what
percentage of occurrences should be used as the cut-off. The
user can also specify the size of the word list to create for the
analysis and the total number of words to analyze; the analysis
macro can also be set to run several times based on increasing
or decreasing numbers of words. The result of all this
automation is that an entire Delta analysis can be performed as
a background task. And, on modest numbers of texts that are
not very large, an entire analysis can be performed easily in an
hour. This allows a researcher to try many different
combinations of options in the search for the most accurate and
reliable results.
My current project involves further elaboration of The Delta
Spreadsheet to automate more of the necessary processes. I
have created an additional spreadsheet into which the user can
enter a list of texts to be processed. Once the texts and their
authors have been entered and the primary and secondary text
sets specified, the user runs a macro that collects the word
frequency lists of these files from the current directory and adds
the appropriate text and author labels. This allows the user then
to cut and paste the word lists into The Delta Spreadsheet for
processing, which simplifies the process, saves time, and
reduces error. A third spreadsheet designed for quicker analysis
of results allows the user to paste in the results of a series of
Delta analyses and run a macro that reformats, sorts, and
prepares the data for graphing, with similar benefits.
A final significant upgrade of The Delta Spreadsheet takes
advantage of an analysis by Shlomo Argamon (forthcoming)
of the statistical bases of Delta. Argamon shows that Delta (as
well as my proposed Delta Primes) can be calculated without
relying on the mean frequencies of words in the primary set of
texts. The revised method of calculation makes possible a more
streamlined version of The Delta Spreadsheet that allows me
to increase the number of texts that the spreadsheet can process.
It should also improve the performance of the macros, which
can take several hours to process a large number of long novels.
My poster will show how the modifications improve the
performance of the spreadsheets and will present an example
with a very large number of authors. I will also be prepared to
do a live software demonstration of the operation of the
spreadsheets at the conference, both on already existing word
frequency lists and on texts which conference attendees supply.

O

ne of the crowning achievements of the 18th century
Enlightenment was the Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire
raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une Société
de Gens de lettres, edited by Diderot and d'Alembert. Published
in Paris between 1751 and 1772, in 17 volumes of text and 11
volumes of plates, it contains 74,000 articles written by more
than 140 contributors.1The Encyclopédie was a massive
reference work for the arts and sciences, as well as a machine
de guerre which served to propagate Enlightenment ideas. The
impact of the Encyclopédie was enormous. Through its attempt
to classify learning and to open all domains of human activity
to its readers, the Encyclopédie gave expression to many of the
most important intellectual and social developments of its time.
The scale and ambition of the Encyclopédie inspired its editors
to adopt three distinct modes of organization which, taken
together, Diderot described as encyclopedic: dictionary,
hierarchical classification, and the renvois (cross-references).
The interaction of these three modes has led modern
commentators to describe the Encyclopédie as an "ancestor of
hypertext" and to depict Diderot as "l'internaute d'hier"2.

D'Alembert underscores the importance of the organization of
knowledge in the Discours Préliminaire:
As an Encyclopedia, it is to set forth the order and connection of
the parts of human knowledge. As a Reasoned Dictionary of the
Sciences, Arts, and Trades, it is to contain the general principles
that form the basis of each science and each art ... and the most
essential facts that make up the body and substance of each.3

Of the three modes of organization, the dictionary mode
(organization of entries in alphabetical order) is certainly the
simplest and the most arbitrary. The second mode of
organization is classification, wherein each dictionary entry is
assigned to a "class of knowledge," placing it within the "order"
of human understanding, as depicted in the Système Figuré des
connaissances humaines. Modeled after Bacon's classification
of knowledge and Enlightenment theories of epistemology, all
understanding is founded upon memory, reason, or imagination,
with numerous categories and sub-categories branching out
from these three faculties.4 However, simply placing an entry
into this hierarchy of knowledge was insufficient to indicate
the interconnections of knowledge. Thus, Diderot created an
extensive system of renvois, the third mode of organization,
providing a lattice of interconnections between individual leaves
of the tree as well as between classes of knowledge.5
The central role of the classification system in the intellectual
objectives of the Encyclopédie editors is indicated by the extent
to which it has been discussed and debated by both
contemporaneous scholars and later researchers. The editors
were remarkably diligent in assigning classes of knowledge to
each article and sub-article. Of the 73,840 main and sub articles,
55,227 were assigned classes of knowledge. The editors were,
however, somewhat less diligent in maintaining a precisely
controlled list. Thus the classifications as found in the text are
an amalgam of abbreviations, conflations, and even entries that
are not found on the Système Figuré. We have recently
completed orthographic normalization of the classes of
knowledge assigned to each article,6" resulting in some 54,289
articles with 2,600 normalized classes of knowledge. The twenty
most frequent classifications by number of articles are:
5513 Géographie
4794 Géographie moderne
3084 Géographie ancienne
2396 Jurisprudence
2304 Grammaire
1894 Marine
1483 Commerce
1277 Histoire naturelle. Botanique
1194 Histoire moderne
1115 Mythologie
1069 Histoire naturelle
889 Histoire ancienne
796 Medecine

730 Architecture
689 Jardinage
682 Littérature
627 Maréchallerie
614 Botanique
558 Histoire ecclésiastique
517 Théologie
Like the Système Figuré, these classifications are a reflection
of how knowledge was ordered and classified in the 18th
century. Given the assumptions that ontologies are historically
contingent and that the Encyclopédie is by far the most
consistent and coherent representation of the structure of 18th
century knowledge in French, this paper reports the results of
our current experiments using machine learning and data mining
techniques to understand and exploit this unique resource. Our
initial objectives are three-fold. First, we plan to examine the
relationship of the classifications to the content of the articles
using machine learning techniques to identify feature sets that
characterize classes of knowledge in the 55,000 articles
classified by the editors of the Encyclopédie. Secondly, we will
apply these feature sets to the 19,500 articles for which we do
not have a class of knowledge and evaluate the accuracy of
classification by randomly selecting articles with known authors
which scholars will then inspect. Most contributors to the
Encyclopédie worked on fairly specific domains -- Rousseau
contributed exclusively on music, for example -- so we can use
authorship as one control for judging the accuracy of
classification. Similarly, the cross-references will also serve as
an evaluation control, since 50% of the renvois link to articles
within the same class of knowledge. Finally, we plan to apply
these feature sets to the unclassified "plate legends" in an effort
to determine accuracy by examining the degree to which
classification of the plate legends reflects the relationship of
particular plate legends to particular articles.
For our initial experiments, we have extracted the text from all
articles that are more than 100 words in length, and which are
categorized within one of the 50 most frequent normalized
classifications. Explicit markers of class of knowledge, present
at the beginnings of these articles, were removed to ensure that
they do not provide facile criteria for classification. The texts
are tokenized and lemmatized7, and frequencies of words and
lemmas are computed both globally and for each article. Words
and lemmas with more than 100 occurrences in the entire
Encyclopédie were used as attributes, and vectors for each
article were generated from the number of occurrences of each
attribute in that article.
We are using the SMO implementation of a support vector
machine in the Weka8 data mining engine for initial
experimentation on smaller data samples, and an SVM-Light9
classifier for larger datasets. While support vector learning
algorithms are very effective for classification problems10, we
Page 82

are also evaluating several other data metrics and machine
learning techniques, including information gain statistics and
J48 decision tree classification as implemented in Weka, to
examine the the most salient features that are used in the
classification process and to test the effectiveness of various
feature set selections.11
Results from preliminary experimentation indicate that SVM
classifiers applied to the articles of the Encyclopédie are very
effective at distinguishing articles from different classes. We
examined 936 unlemmatized articles in our sample dataset
belonging to the classes Medecine (499) and Mythologie (437).
The Weka SMO classifier using default options with 10-fold
cross-validation correctly recognized 98.29% of the articles
(920/936). Under the same parameters, the Weka J48 tree
classifier achieved slightly lower performance (91.66%
accuracy). The decision tree showed a clear split on medical
content words, such as maladie, humeurs, inflammation, and
so on. Such strong performance may be due to the fact that one
would not expect to find similar vocabularies in articles dealing
with medicine and mythology. We achieved similar
performance by classifying 2,448 articles equally divided
between modern and ancient geography. The SMO training
achieved 100% accuracy with 92.2% accuracy on
cross-validation. Inspection of the most important features in
both J48 tree and InfoGain measures shows a strong preference
for classical authors (Pline, Ptolomée) and places (Gaule,
Thrace), and the strings "l", "lib" and "liv", which correspond
to citations of classical authors (e.g. Pline, l. IV. c. xvj.).12
Distance and location terms (lieues, long., latit.) are strongly
correlated with modern geography. Furthermore, the function
words "selon" and "dit", which are far more prevalent in ancient
geography articles as the authors were citing classical
descriptions, are given high InfoGain scores.
We anticipate assigning classes of knowledge to articles that
were not originally classified by the editors iteratively by
comparing all unknown articles to specific classes of knowledge
rather than trying to classify all unknown articles en masse. To
test this approach, we assembled two sets of articles each
containing 1,209 instances. The first set contained articles
categorized by the editors as belonging to ancient geography,
while the second set was constituted by selecting, for each
article in the first set, an article as close as possible in length
but belonging to a different class of knowledge. Using SMO
training, we achieved 97.8% accuracy with standard 10-fold
cross-validation. Again, the most heavily weighted features
were terms denoting classical authors and place names, along
with a greater preponderance of more general geographic terms,
comporting nicely with a reasonable human's intuitive
understanding of what makes a document on ancient geography
distinct from another documents. We further validated our
results by running another experiment identical to the first
except that each article was randomly labeled as either ancient

Digital Humanities 2007
geography or not ancient geography, irrespective of its true
classification. The principle of Random Falsifiability states that
if random labels can be learned with the same ease (for SVM,
'ease' can be defined as proportion of support vectors required
13
) as true class labels, the method must be rejected as
unreliable. After 10-fold cross-validation, SMO achieved a
mere 50.2895% accuracy on the classification, barely surpassing
random chance. That our method cannot learn the random labels
at all suggests that our success in discrimination is in fact based
on inherent differences between the two classes and not merely
a greedy model's exploitation of arbitrary patterns in the data
distribution.
The SMO model derived from comparing ancient geography
to a random selection of articles in other classes allows us to
test classification on a set of unclassified articles. To do this,
we assembled 5,000 randomly selected articles containing more
than 100 words for which classification was unknown and with
attributed authorship. We then applied the ancient geography
SMO model to this set in an effort to identify articles pertaining
to this category. The recall of this experiment was far too high.
In the future we intend to implement a classifier that reports a
numeric score rather than a simple binary categorization. There
were, however, within the results a number of correctly
classified articles such as the river ASOPE and the articles
GARAMANTES and Ionique Transmigration. Many of the
misclassified articles, such as ADONIES, ou FESTES
ADONIENNES and Danse astronomique, pertain to classical
history, mythology and other related fields. In addition to
implementing a ranking classifier, we will also investigate
moving up the tree of knowledge in order to use a coarser
classification scheme; e.g., rather than remaining at the leaves
of "ancient" and "modern" geography, we would use the branch
of geography itself as a general category.
The impressive performance of machine learning algorithms
suggests that the editors of the Encyclopédie were quite
judicious in their assignments of classifications, a claim which
will be tested further in the full paper. Examination of the
features most effective in classification tasks will establish a
sort of thesaurus which will give scholars a better understanding
of the organization of knowledge during the Englightenment.
Furthermore, we believe that the creation of well-verified
training sets on this large corpus will allow us to test the degree
to which we may profitably apply what the systems have learned
to articles and plate legends which were not classified at the
time, using the contemporary ontologies. If this series of
experiments is successful, we would anticipate using the training
sets from the classifications in the Encyclopédie to attempt to
classify passages in other 18th century French documents.

1. Introduction

C

an computational analysis better reveal how
Shakespeare's words and phrases construct characters
clearly gendered as male and female? What happens when
stylistic analysis is brought to bear on a longstanding notion in
literary and cultural studies that gender identity is a discursive
(i.e. a culturally-decodable lexical and semantic) construction?
How helpful can linguistic style be in explaining aspects of
literary style?
Last year we presented our first results (Hota et al. 2006) in
analyzing lexical items of character gender in Shakespeare. Our
observations on gender character were in line with previous
work (Argamon et al. 2003) on discriminating author gender
in modern texts, supporting the idea that Shakespeare projects
character gender in a manner consistent with patterns of
authorial gender projection found in other texts both literary
and nonliterary.
In this abstract, we extend and refine our methods by focusing
on lexical and semantic language use by Shakespeare for
determining the gender of his literary characters. Here we used
a better version of Shakespeare corpus, the Nameless
Shakespeare. In the Nameless Shakespeare, each lexical item
is fully tagged with lemma entries. Our accuracy has improved
to 81% using lemma features, compared to last year’s results.
We observe that lemmas and tri-grams help identify a
Shakespearean character’s gender. In addition, discrimination
models using lemmas and tri-grams may allow literary and
cultural scholars to see discursive patterns that, while impossible
Page 84

Digital Humanities 2007
to find noncomputationally, nonetheless portray or construct a
character’s attitudes as male or female

the corpus to avoid bias in the automated learning procedure;
this introduces other issues which we address below.

The fact that these patterns hold across literary and nonliterary
texts, and from early-modern to modern English, supports their
possible significance in understanding discursively-formed
gender identity. We further observe other distinguishing
features, including the fact that some feature constellations
match well to previous reports of features that distinguish male
from female authors (Argamon et al. 2003). We have analyzed
the concordance lines of lexical and lemma tri gram occurrences
from the corpus and found patterns of phrasal usage that indicate
significant gender differences in language use in the plays.
We are interested in understanding gender characterization
based on major characters and minor characters, and in
understanding how prose and verse forms impact gendered
speech in Shakespeare. We are also interested in how words
highly-associated with a particular gender may also help with
plotting, dramatic tension, and closure. We will present our
findings at the conference.

2. Methodology

W

e applied text classification methods using machine
learning with feature sets described above, under the
umbrella of a well-tagged corpus. If reasonable classification
accuracy is achieved with these new sets of features, it will
show that Shakespeare used words differently for his male and
for his female characters. If this is the case, then examining the
most discriminating features should give some insight into how
gender stylistics flows into socio-linguistic and literary gender
construction.

2.1 Corpus Construction
We constructed a corpus of characters' speeches from 35
Shakespearean
plays,
collected
from
the
lexically-and-lemmatically-tagged Nameless Shakespeare. The
plays are in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format. To
import them into our system, we extracted the speeches and
the gender of each character automatically, cleaning the stage
directions. A text file for each character in each play was
constructed by concatenating all of that character’s speeches
in the play. We only considered characters with 200 or more
words. From that collection, all female characters were chosen.
Then we took the same number of male characters as female
characters from a play, restricted to those not longer than the
longest female character from that particular play. In this way,
we balanced the corpus for gender, giving a total of 101 female
characters and 101 male characters, with equal numbers of
males and females from each play (see Table 1). We balance

2.2 Feature Extraction
We processed the text using the ATMan system, a text
processing system in Java that we have developed. The text is
tokenized and the system produces a sequence of tokens. Each
token corresponds to a word in the input text file. We used
lexical and lemma features with n = 1, 2 and 3 gram
combinations. In order to understand gendered language more
deeply, we extracted those n-grams most linked to gender
(Tables 2, 3). We collected most frequent 500 words, bigrams
(2670) and trigrams (356) from the lexical entries. In the same
way 2001 unigrams, 2860 bigrams, and 571 trigrams from
lemmas were collected. We calculated the frequencies of these
various features and computed their relative frequencies. The
list of various feature sets with their counts is given Tables 3-5.

Digital Humanities 2007

3 Results: Accuracy and Feature
Analysis

M

any feature combinations give classification accuracies
near or above 70%, which is quite good (random would
be 50%, since the corpus is balanced). The highest accuracy of
all (80.69%) was attained using the 500 most frequent word
lemmas as features. Lexical (surface tokens) also worked well,
with unigrams plus bi grams plus tri grams combination as a
whole giving the highest accuracy (75.74%). The accuracy is
captured in Table 4.

2.3 Text Classification
The classification learning phase of this task is carried out by
Weka's (Frank & Witten 1999) implementation of Sequential
Minimal Optimization (Platt 1998) (SMO) using a linear kernel
and default parameters. The output of SMO is a model linearly
weighting the various features. Testing was done via 10 fold
cross validation. With this methodology, we ensure that each
character is tested on at least once with training that does not
include it. Table 4 presents the results obtained by running
various experiments.

The feature analysis phase is carried out by taking the results
obtained from Weka’s implementation of SMO. SMO provides
weights to the features corresponding to both class labels. To
discriminate binary class labels, SMO uses positive and negative
weight values in a linear model. After sorting the features based
on their weights, we collected the top ten features indicative of
each gender. We have also computed the average value of each
feature for each gender (Tables 5-10). For reasons of space we
consider here just those feature sets giving the most insight (as
well as good classification accuracy). We also ranked features
using information gain (IG), defined as the expected reduction
in entropy caused by partitioning the training set according to
the attribute.
Lemma Unigrams:
In Shakespeare, several meaningful clusters of words emerge.
Female lemmas indicate family relationships (‘husband’,
‘mother’, ‘court’) , feelings (‘sick’, ‘merry’), emotional
injections (‘alas’, ‘o’, ‘prithee’), and integration of personal
context (‘he’, ‘you’). Male features indicate concern with
quantification (‘three’) and social status (‘noble’, ‘solemn’,
‘savage’). Male lemmas also include some less-clearly
interpretable verb forms (‘begin’, ‘alight’, ‘beat’).
Lemma Trigrams:

Page 86

Digital Humanities 2007
More specific meaning patterns can be seen in lemma triples.
Female trigrams mostly indicate construal of self and others
(‘I/see/you’, ‘for/I/to’, ‘I/know/I’, ‘be/he/not’, ‘say/I/be’),
politeness (‘thank/you/for’), conditionals (‘if/he/have’), and
questions (‘who/be/that’). Male trigrams focus on assertions
(‘I/say/to’) mainly about personal/social status (‘but/I/be’,
‘be/a/very’, ‘be/a/ass’, ‘I/be/ he’), possessions (‘have/no/more’,
‘I/have/lose’), and manner (‘the/manner/of’).
Analysis of Concordance Lines:
For both lexical and lemmatic trigrams, we contextualize usage
by examining concordance lines. For males, 'the name of'’ is
followed usually by 'truth', 'hero', 'love', 'justice', 'whore', while
for females, this trigram is followed by 'wife', 'jesting' and
sometimes with the name of a female character. Men use this
to invoke overarching abstractions (or to insult women), while
women talk about “names of” in a less metaphorical and more
neutral fashion. For 'do you know', males tend to follow with
another question, but not females. Strikingly, males use 'the
manner of,' to set up dramatic contrasts or even shifts in
dramatic action, but female use of this trigram is entirely
unremarkable in this way.

4 Discussion

T

hese findings capture word patterning in Shakespeare
inaccessible to non-computational methods of literary
analysis, because of the scale of data processing involved.
Literary scholars work almost exclusively with well-elaborated
methods of semantic analysis (New Criticism, structuralism,
and post-structuralism), developed with all the strengths and
limitations posed by a book-only, eye-centered,
subjectivity-dependent research context. In contrast, these
findings encourage comparisons between non-computational
and computational approaches. It is remarkable that these
findings support aspects of non-computational methodology
(words linked together in meaningful patterns like informational
discourse/male and involved discourse/female), while also
bringing to light new structural features of Shakespeare’s
discursive gender construction through language: parts of speech
use, tri-gram combinations of words. These findings may, in
addition, capture creative and literary patterning in greater detail
than is possible with noncomputational literary methods alone.
Since Shakespeare’s plays depend greatly on gender-identified
characters, the words linked to gender most likely also serve
literary purposes. In the plays, heterosexual romance is linked
not only to characterization, but also to action, and in the case
of romantic comedies, to how the plays conclude. In the cases
of complex characterization, a character’s misuse of gendered
speech may also be central to how Shakepeare develops
dramatic action.

Limitations:

Acknowledgements:

The editorial procedures for The Nameless Shakespeare are
sound and practical for the project’s purposes and for the work
of this paper, but they need to be read and understood fully:
both by literary scholars wanting to apply these findings to
particular words in particular plays, and by computational
scholars thinking through the problem of establishing textual
accuracy prior to inviting a wider community to conduct
searches. Also, with respect to Shakespeare’s literary art, the
findings here do not at this stage account for the impact of blank
verse dialogue (for high or elite characters) versus prose
dialogue (for low or common-born characters) on word choices
and the numbers of words. It may be that blank verse fosters
semantically significant tri-gram constructions because
Shakespeare needed short words to complete plays primarily
written in ten-syllable lines. But at least the question can be
asked, and the answer will tell us something about Shakespeare
both as dramatist and as poet. In addition, our work focuses on
the heternormativity clearly present in Shakespeare’s plays, but
does not exclude nonheteronormative gender construction.
Finally and significantly, the gender-balancing used here had
the odd result of excluding from the corpus all major male
characters in Shakespeare, including every male character
named in a play’s title, because all these characters speak more
than 600 lines. All major female characters (including females
named in titles) are included. We now know that very-long
speech length per play efficiently identify characters as male,
but we also will test our findings on the males excluded so far
and report the results at the conference.

T

his is the first work, to our knowledge, in analyzing
various textual features (lexical and lemma) collected
from a single source in understanding literary character gender.
We see, as in our earlier work (Hota et al. 2006) that the male
and female language in Shakespeare’s characters is similar to
that found in modern texts by male and female authors
(Argamon et.al 2003). Here we also observed the importance
of trigrams for lexical and lemma features. Trigrams are few
in number, so they are information rich and computationally
efficient for identifying gender. The true import of the features
identified by this analysis need to be confirmed by more
traditional digital humanities methods such as examining
concordance lines, to allow a more properly contextual
interpretation. In any case, we believe that this study shows
how classification learning can be used as a tool in developing
new ‘statistical’ interpretative methodologies for bodies of
literary works.

Nameless Shakespeare corpus and many helpful
comments in gender characterization in Shakespeare.

2. Experimental Setup:
1. Introduction:

T

here exists a large number of critical writings regarding
humanities objects such as reviews, forum posts, mailing
lists and blogs. In many cases, readers do not necessarily know
the authenticity and credibility of such writings. It is desirable
to have a tool that is able to distinguish professional criticisms
from lay comments, and furthermore, to measure the
authenticity of criticisms on humanities objects. Such tools can
have many applications ranging from mass mail filtering to
customized criticism recommendation and summarization. In
a preceding study we demonstrated that a simple machine
learning model can be used to automatically differentiate
editorial critiques (i.e., those written by professional critics)
from customer critiques (i.e., those written by interested
members of the general public) (Hu et al. 2006a). In this poster,
we extend and build upon our earlier work to include a new
class of cultural objects (i.e., United States Literature) and to
uncover the set of influential features that contribute to making
“editorial” and “customer” reviews distinct.
For the sake of comparison, we use the same dataset as in (Hu
et al 2006a), namely reviews from amazon.com, the largest
online retailer of various humanities materials including books
and music. On amazon.com, many book and music objects have
both editorial reviews and customer reviews. The former are
written by editors in amazon.com, who can be seen as experts,
while the latter are written by arbitrary users from the general
public. Besides the two product categories analyzed in (Hu et
al 2006a), British Classic Literature books and Classical music
CDs, we add a third category, United States Classic Literature.
The three categories are among the most relevant to the
humanities, yet cover different media and cultures. To eliminate
possible product bias, we downloaded both editorial and
Page 90

H

u (Hu et al 2006a) demonstrated that a binary text
classifier based on a Nai ve Bayesian model was able
to classify editorial and customer reviews at accuracies of about
86%. Two sets of features were used in building the models.
The first one is unigrams of all original tokens including content
words, function words and punctuations, with the purpose of
preserving all stylistic clues carried by the original writings.
The second one is unigrams of all function words2 which can
carry important stylistic fingerprints (Stamatatos et al., 2002,
Argamon et al., 2003). We discovered interesting features
unique to each type of criticism. For example, professional
critiques tend to use numbers while customers tend to use terms
referring to personal experiences. However, unigram features
bear virtually no context information. Therefore in this poster,
we deepen our understanding by analyzing features with broader
context information: bigrams and trigrams of the
aforementioned two sets of tokens (Banerjee & Pedersen 2003).
For easy comparison, the results of the classification
experiments are presented in Table 2. It shows function words,
though a small token set, can capture most of the differences
of the two kinds of criticism. Comparing features with varying
depths of context, we found bigram features consistently
improve classification accuracies (to a level of 87.22% -89.25%) while trigram features do not achieve consistent
improvement on classification accuracies. It is noteworthy that
trigrams of function words are not as good as other feature sets.
In fact, the genuine function word trigrams are too sparse in
the datasets, so here we define a function word trigram is a
sequence of 3 function words that occur within a window of 5
tokens in the text.

Digital Humanities 2007

Table 2

Upon a closer examination of the classification result on British
Literature review set using trigrams of all tokens where the
mean accuracy (72.80%) significantly worsened compared to
its bigram and unigram counterparts, we found only 1.1%
editorial reviews were wrongly classified as customer reviews
but 53.1% customer reviews were misclassified as editorial
reviews. This means the model can identify features unique to
customer reviews but cannot reliably identify those unique to
editorial reviews. A possible reason for this phenomenon is the
British Literature dataset is dominated by reviews of similar
books. This is supported by the bigram and trigram feature
analyses described in next section. A large portion of the top
features in this dataset is related to Shakespeare.

K

nowing that editorial and customer reviews are separable
is not sufficient in and of itself; rather, we must strive
toward understanding what features make them distinct. The
binary Nai ve Bayesian text classifiers applied here can rank
the terms according to their relative importance in the
construction of the categorization model (Hu & Downie 2006).

experiences and prefer to express their emotions. Experts also
use many technical terms while ordinary readers tend to use
informal writing styles such as spoken language, contractions
and nonstandard marks. Both experts and common readers refer
to authors or artists, but very few readers bother using proper
diacritical characters, instead opting to use basic Latin letters.
It is interesting to see that common readers use more quotations,
adverbs and punctuations than experts.

A

s we can see from the tables, there are features consistent
in editorial reviews across the three types of humanities
objects that distinguish editorial critiques from customer
critiques:
1. Numbers, both ordinal and cardinal, e.g., “in the twentieth”,
“than forty”, “hundredth”
2. Technical terms e.g., “songwriter”, “bassist”, “in D Major”
3. Author or artist names using diacritical characters: e.g.,
“Bronte ”, “Barto k”, “Taka cs"
4. Authoritative resources, e.g., “Folger Shakespeare Library”,
“CliffsNotes study guides”
5. Emphasis of the third person voice

5. Conclusions and Future Work:

W

e extended our previous work on classifying
editorial/professional reviews and customer reviews
on humanities objects, and then examined the influential
features in each of the review categories. Particularly, we
examined two feature sets, “all tokens” and “function words
only”, with context depths ranging from unigrams to trigrams.
Results show that the two kinds of reviews are distinct. By
using the NB feature ranking method, we found interesting and
unique features associated with each type of review. Such
features are important in enriching digital humanities
repositories and facilitating criticism filtering and
recommendation. The feature analyses also disclose new
questions such as how criticism on literatures from various
countries (e.g. British vs. U.S.) differs among one another. This
will be part of our future work. We will also examine other
critical writing resources such as mailing lists and forums for
similar patterns between “expert” and “lay” contributors.

Similarly, there are important features found in the customer
reviews that contribute to their identity:
1. Terms referring to personal experience and the first person
voice: e.g., “I found”, “I’m”, “I read”
2. Exclamation marks (“!”): from unigram to trigram, “!”
consistently appear as top features.
3. Adverbs: e.g., “definitely”, “actually”, “possibly”
4. Contractions: e.g., “I’d”, “won’t”, “you’re”, “that’s”,
“wouldn’t”,
5. Variations of artist names without diacritical characters:
e.g., “Bartok”, “Takacs”
6. Quotations (“&quot;” in XML documents) : e.g., “. quot;
The ”, “, quot; is”
7. Colloquial phrases, e.g., “is like”, “is actually”, “have to
say
8. Nonstandard words and marks: e.g., “_”, “cd”, “cds”
Most of the observed differences seem reasonable. Experts like
to have more accurate descriptions by using numbers, citing
authoritative resources, etc. While experts write in a more
objective manner by using a third person voice, ordinary readers
tend to connect humanities objects with their own personal

Background

O

ne common task in digital humanities is the creation of
digital representations of cultural artifacts, often in the
form of transcriptions of existing physical documents. When
we say, though, that a resource is a transcription of a particular
document, what do we mean? What inferences are licensed by
that claim? Given a transcription and adequate knowledge of
the rules it follows, what do we learn about the document of
which it is a transcription?
This paper proposes a formal account of transcription, as a way
of elucidating the concept as it applies in scholarly editing and
in the creation of digital resources. This approach may also
provide insight into the nature of electronic representations of
cultural artifacts, digital preservation, and text encoding more
generally. It may have practical consequences for quality
assurance and for the representation of markup semantics in
formal systems.
In this abstract, we first present the basic outlines of our
approach and our model of transcription, for simplicity's sake
addressing only the very simplest cases. We then address some
issues pertaining to less simple cases and discuss elaborations
of the model. Because this is work in progress, the abstract is
more sketchy on the latter issues, on which we expect to report
more extensively in the paper as presented at the conference.

General outline of the approach

I

n general, one document (the transcription, T) is said to be
a transcription of another document (the examplar, E) if T
was copied out from E with the intent, successfully achieved,
of providing a faithful representation of a text as witnessed in
E. Often the purpose is to make this representation easier to
make use of, than E itself. (For example, T may be easier to
read or duplicate than E, or may be able to travel while E
cannot.)
Page 93

Digital Humanities 2007
This description refers crucially to the intent with which T is
made and the uses to which it may be put. These matters may
be essential in deciding whether T is a transcription of E. In
this paper, however, we investigate to what extent it is possible
to characterize, without taking such matters into account, the
relationship between T and E which allows the one to serve as
a record of information derived from the other. In the simplest
cases, where both E and T have an unproblematic, clearly
legible inscription, this relation is simple: the two documents
contain the same sequence of letters, spaces, punctuation marks
and other symbols.
But what does it mean to say that a manuscript letter is “the
same” as e.g. a typed or printed transcription of that manuscript?
In simple cases, the question rarely arises, yet in transcriptions
of historical documents it may be urgent. The difficulty of
reading often consists precisely in the difficulty of deciding
which letters the various marks on a manuscript page indicate
(if any), and may be one reason for transcribing in the first
place.
In order to establish a more precise account of the “sameness”
of sequences of letters, we begin by distinguishing the concepts
document, mark, token and type.
By a document we understand an individual physical object
containing marks. A mark is a perceptible feature (normally
something visible, e.g. a line in ink) of a document. Marks may
be identified as tokens in so far as they are instances of types,
and collections of marks may be identified as sequences of
tokens in so far as they are instances of sequences of types. In
other words, a mark is a token if, but only if, it is understood
as instantiating a type.
The distinction among marks, tokens, and types may be applied
at various levels: letters, words, sentences, texts. The
identification and separation of the marks, tokens, and types of
a document requires a competent reader. A theory of
interpretation or of reading is not the concern of our paper,
however — our goal is only to elucidate what it means to say
that T is a transcription of E, however the interpretive processes
resulting in T are properly understood.
Based on this outline of the relation between E and T and the
distinction among documents, marks, tokens, and types, the
following gives a first approximation to a more formal account
of the meaning, in the simplest cases, of the statement that T
is a transcription of E:
1. E and T are documents. (It follows that E and T each contain
marks.)
2. The marks of each document are interpreted as instantiating
a sequence of types:
•

Page 94

Each mark is identified as constituting one and only one
token.

•
•

Each token is identified as instantiating one and only
one specific type.
To the tokens of each document, an ordering is assigned
which is total, relative and linear.

3. The two sequences of tokens thus identified instantiate
identical sequences of types.
A more explicit account of these points is best given not in
prose but in a more formal notation. The full paper will provide
translations of the description above into the modeling language
Alloy [Jackson 2006]; for brevity, these formalisms are omitted
from this abstract.
This simple account agrees well enough with common usage.
Vander Meulen and Tanselle (1999), for example, describe
transcription as “the effort to report — insofar as typography
allows — precisely what the textual inscription of a manuscript
consists of”. We take “textual inscription” to denote the physical
tokens of the document, and the method of reporting the textual
inscription of the exemplar to be the creation of another
document whose textual inscription produces (when rightly
read) the same sequence of abstract types.
Even commonplace phenomena require further elaboration of
this model (see below), but this simple model already illustrates
some essential features of transcription.
•

•

•

In a transcription, “an A is an A is an A” — one instance
of a letter type is (for purposes of transcription)
interchangeable with any other. Detailed information about
the shape of individual marks is lost; the only salient
information about the token in the exemplar is which type
it maps to.
The set of letter types distinguished in a transcription helps
define that transcription; the choice of an appropriate
inventory is a basic responsibility of the transcriber and a
fertile source of disagreements.
The formal relation between exemplar and transcript is
symmetric and transitive. (Not necessarily so the concept
of transcription — just the formal relation.)

Application and elaboration

A

satisfactory formal account of transcription must deal
with complications ignored above and will require
elaboration of the basic outline. Our account has some affinity
with Nelson Goodman's theory of notation [Goodman 1976].
We have no general characterization of these complications
yet, so we introduce them here in the form of examples:
Some transcriptions must account both for systematic ambiguity
of tokens in the writing system (a particular shape sometimes
instantiates one type, sometimes another) and for uncertainty

Digital Humanities 2007
about which token is actually present. These cases present
special difficulties for the choice of the appropriate type
inventory.
The mapping from mark to type may depend on context: marks
of similar shape may be read now as commas, now as full stops.
Paleographic transcriptions often mark line breaks by vertical
bars; the type sequence in the transcript thus appears to include
items not present in that of the original. Shall the line breaks
of the exemplar be understood as a special kind of letter token?
Some transcribers normalize or regularize the spelling of the
exemplar, sometimes silently. The unit of transcription, in such
cases, is the lexical item or word form, rather than the letter.

reliable. Alternatively, one might treat marked up documents
as representing a mixed notation, with character data content
operating in one way, and markup in a different way. Goodman,
for example, analyses drama as a mixed notation, in which the
dialog functions as a “score”, but the stage directions function
as a “script”; the analogy with markup may prove informative.
Whatever the approach, a key challenge for any formal
treatment of transcription is to make it fit into the more powerful
notions of textual structure reflected in modern markup systems.
This is the most important topic to be addressed in the further
development of the formal model of transcription.

Scribal abbreviations pose a challenge: expanding them destroys
the one-to-one correspondence between the tokens in the
original and in the transcript. How can such expansions best
be modeled? Perhaps each token in the exemplar corresponds
to one or more tokens in the transcript? But then what of
shorthand transcriptions made for private use, in which
abbreviations are not expanded but introduced? The relation
between the type sequences of exemplar and transcript must
be more complex than simple identity.

Bibliography

Sometimes transcriptions include marks to which no mark in
the exemplar seems to correspond. Vertical lines in a
paleographic transcription may (as suggested above) be
interpretable as transcribing line breaks in the exemplar. But if
the transcription provides line numbers as well, it's difficult to
stretch the notion of allographic variation to cover them.
Similarly, transcriptions may contain expansions of
abbrevations, supply letters or words assumed to be left out
from the exemplar by slips of the pen, transcriber's comments
on the wording or physical appearance of the examplar, etc.,
i.e. “additional” content not found in the exemplar.

Dimensional Medium." Computers and the Humanities 28
(1995): 235-241.

The most fundamental problem, however, is given by the silent
assumption, in the preceding remarks, that the text represented
in a particular document, and thus the document itself, can
usefully be represented as a one-dimensional sequence of types.
This view appears painfully simplistic in the light of recent
years' work on XML and text encoding. Even in conventional
printed books, characters seldom have only one possible
sequence. And digital representations seldom limit themselves
to preserving the sequence of graphemes in the exemplar;
normally, they use markup to identify larger textual units and
make explicit aspects of the text which may lack any
conventional orthographic representation.
One might take the structural units identified by markup (e.g.
the elements of an XML document) as instantiating complex
types; such an approach would in some ways resemble
Goodman's analysis of ‘characters’, with the markup used to
make the identification of complex characters explicit and

L

a musicologie a toujours été une discipline multi- et
interdisciplinaire, de nombreuses disciplines étant
pertinentes à l'étude de la musique et des textes musicaux:
l'histoire, l'ethnologie, la sociologie, l'informatique, la
linguistique... Le travail présenté ici illustre cette
interdisciplinarité. En effet, notre outil fait appel à des
compétences en histoire musicale et générale, théorie musicale,
linguistique et informatique et fait collaborer des chercheurs
du groupe«Lexique Musical de la Renaissance (LMR)» (EA
2560, Patrimoines Musicaux, Université Paris-Sorbonne) et du
laboratoire«Langages Logiques, Informatique Cognition
Communication
(LaLICC)»
(FRE2919,
Université
Paris-Sorbonne/CNRS).
Cet outil se présente sous la forme d'un dictionnaire du langage
musical depuis la naissance de la théorisation musicale en
langue vernaculaire jusqu'au seuil de la formation du langage
tonal. Les entrées de ce dictionnaire sont fournies par les textes
eux-me mes; textes essentiellement en langues néolatines à
cause me me de la matrice de la théorisation musicale: le latin.
Il réunit des citations se référant aux modalités d'élaboration,
de production, de réception et circulation des savoirs théoriques
musicaux qui constituent la base de données du projet. Son
dictionnaire formera le fondement de la réflexion
musicologique: réflexion unilingue définissant les champs
sémantiques; réflexion interactive multilingue établissant des
rapports entre les termes et les concepts.
Le but final de l'outil est sans aucun doute la musique,
c'est-à-dire la partition produite au moment étudié. Mais au lieu
de lui appliquer une théorisation a posteriori et des schémas
musicaux/mentaux qui ne lui appartiennent pas, il est préférable
d'aller d'abord aux textes théoriques et pratiques de la musique
produite, ainsi qu'aux témoignages philosophiques, littéraires
ou didactiques sur la discipline. L'étude de ceux-ci, leur
élaboration à partir de leur contexte culturel et linguistique,
Page 96

fournira un outil propre à saisir et à comprendre nouvellement
la musique de ce temps sans pour autant chercher à résoudre
la dichotomie entre langage et musique.
Des dictionnaires techniques de la musique existent: ils
présentent tous la caractéristique d'offrir une terminologie
appréhendée et définie à partir du moment où leurs éléments
sont conceptualisés et offerts à la consultation des spécialistes,
musicologues ou musiciens. Une contemporanéité,
d'aujourd'hui, qui offre à l'observateur un outil d'analyse
anachronique, pour le passé. Dans cette perspective, la réflexion
sur le terme musical est donc faite après sa mise en oeuvre dans
l'histoire par le musicien, le théoricien ou le praticien, au travers
d'un rideau temporel et de la superposition de strates-culturelles,
techniques et musicales, multiples.
Depuis des décennies la musicologie a, en partie, fléchi ces
orientations et le présent projet s'inscrit dans une lignée qui
n'est pas totalement novatrice. Nous remarquerons d'abord que
bien des études inscrivent leur réflexion sur le texte musical
ancien dans le contexte de la production théorique
contemporaine. Ainsi, pour s'en tenir à un exemple, les derniers
travaux de Margarita Bent (« Diatonic ficta»; Early Music
History, 4, 1984; trad. Français, Paris, Minerve,2003) ou Bonnie
J. Blackburn (« On compositional Process in the Fifteenth
Century»; Journal of American Musicological Society, 1987,
trad. Français, ibid.) sont en effet proches de la pensée musicale
théorisée de l'époque avant que de l'appliquer à leur approche
analytique des oeuvres mises à l'épreuve. Mais les critères de
sélection de ces textes ne sont jamais justifiés et ce ne sont que
quelques textes choisis qui viennent appuyer ou infléchir la
lecture dont l'on notera qu'elle se fait toujours dans un rapport
triangulaire (texte théorique + musicologue auteur + collègue
musicologue pris à témoin dans l'acquiescement ou la réfutation
de l'argumentation). Notre travail s'inscrit dans la lecture
textuelle de l'époque mais celle-ci se veut sinon exhaustive, du
moins totalisante. Par ailleurs nous ne chercherons pas a priori
à adopter une attitude favorable ou contraire à l'une ou l'autre
orientation musicologique actuelle. Seuls les résultats futurs
permettront, ou non, d'adopter une nouvelle épistémologie des
oeuvres musicales de la période considérée.
Durant la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, d'autres dictionnaires
tels que le « Handwörterbuch der musikalischen Terminologie
(Htm) » fondé par Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht ouvrent également
une voie nouvelle d'approche de la lexicologie musicale.
Cependant sa remarquable entreprise reste marquée par les
prospectives antérieurs et ne s'en affranchit que dans les années
1970-1980. A partir de ces dates naissent, avec les nouvelles
technologies, de nouveaux outils qui ont mis en ligne les textes
originaux (Université d'Indiana, USA: textes en latin, français
et italien) ou cherchent à en dresser des études lexicales (sur le
latin: prof. Bernhard, université de Munich en collaboration de

Digital Humanities 2007
l'université de d'Indiana; sur le corpus italien: prof. Wiering,
université d'Utrecht).
Le présent projet est plus proche du«Lessico italiano del canto»
(Canto) par son recours systématique aux textes contemporains
et aux disciplines conjuguées de la linguistique et de la
musicologie. Fondé en 1987 par le prof. Sergio Durante
(université de Padoue), le programme Canto recherche la mise
en rapport entre textes théoriques et musique mais cette
recherche s'effectue dans une aire géographique déterminée et
une temporalité définie. Cette recherche embrasse, en Italie,
les paramètres du phénomène du chant de 1600 à 1800.
Notre étude vise à d'établir la genèse d'une pensée proprement
lexico-musicale et de l'amplifier à d'autres aires linguistiques
et à d'autres temporalités. L'originalité de notre travail consiste
en la recherche d'une totale autonomie de la pensée musicale,
tant dans la formation du thesaurus lexical et des citations que
dans la réflexion menée sur le corpus.
Les objectifs finaux sont:
•

•

•

•

•

•

•

de relire et repenser les traités de théorie et pratique
musicales, et autres écrits véhiculant le langage sur la
musique, de la période considérée;
de dresser un corpus plurilingue des termes techniques, dans
un sens générique, touchant la musique en ses moments de
préparation, de production, de perception et de réception;
de former un dictionnaire raisonné comprenant un répertoire
de citations pertinentes des différentes langues techniques
musicales vernaculaires en pleine élaboration dans leur
saisie du phénomène sonore;
de définir le niveau de compréhension du phénomène sonore
en chaque langue et en des périodes distinctes c'est-à-dire
de réfléchir aux vitesses d'implantation, de consolidation et
d'évacuation ou permanence des termes/concepts dans la
langue technique;
de créer une nouvelle articulation entre les deux niveaux de
langage en un projet sémiotique entre le langage théorique
musical et la propre création de l'objet musical;
de redéfinir ainsi un outil de lecture interprétative et
d'analyse de la musique à partir de la perception des acteurs
de l'époque par la création de nouveaux champs de contenus
musicaux;
de mettre à la disposition des chercheurs l'acquisition de ce
nouveau savoir, par l'accès à la base de données.

Les étapes préparatoires au projet ont fait l'objet d'échanges
entre les chercheurs afin de permettre de former des outils
favorisant un travail pouvant e tre mené en commun mais
également de façon autonome.
Le corpus bibliographique des langues principales (français,
italien, espagnol) a été constitué. D'autres langues sont appelées

à s'y joindre et demandent une approche bibliographique encore
en cours de réalisation (portugais, catalan, roumain...). Le choix
des textes, imprimés ou manuscrits, est établi au plus près de
l'édition originale qui sert d'unique référence. Si celle-ci est
inaccessible, il y aura lieu de recourir aux facsimilés ou films
des originaux. A défaut l'édition critique la plus fiable est
exploitée.
Un prototype de la base de données a été élaboré1 avec le
logiciel Microsoft Access. Gérée sur un poste unique, cette
base était alimentée par les chercheurs de manière indirecte et
n'était pas accessible en consultation. Chaque chercheur
effectuait sa propre campagne de relevés de citations et la
stockait dans un fichier Microsoft Word dont l'organisation
avait été préalablement discutée. Les fichiers étaient envoyées
à l'administrateur de la base de données qui y intégrait ces
données.
Pour le développement du projet, deux constats se sont imposés:
•

•

les chercheurs impliqués dans la constitution des ressources
devaient pouvoir directement saisir leurs données et y
accéder;
toutes les ressources devaient e tre mise à la disposition
de tous les musicologues, musiciens... par le biais d'internet.

Ainsi, du prototype développé avec un système de base de
données fermé, nous sommes passé à un système ouvert, basé
sur la trilogie Apache-PHP-MySQL, accessible sur internet
(<http://www.pm.paris4.sorbonne.fr/LMR>).
La base de données fournit aujourd'hui un réservoir de citations
et des définitions d'acceptions multiples à tout chercheur. Sa
mise en ligne permet un questionnement élaboré par la création
de liens de consultations ou d'interrogations qui intègrent les
exemples musicaux et les illustrations iconographiques contenus
dans les traités. Elle donne aux chercheurs participant à
l'élaboration des ressources constitutives de l'outil, un accès
sécurisé, pour la saisie, les modifications et les corrections de
leurs données et l'organisation sémantique du dictionnaire.
Cet outil vise un nouveau savoir musical où la formulation
d'une pensée musicale doit e tre linguistiquement autonome
dans une aire géographique donnée. Il doit favoriser
l'élaboration d'études spécialisées sur des champs précis de la
théorie musicale et permettre de faire apparai tre des
connexions entre ce corpus musical et la contemporanéité de
l'état social, politique et le savoir culturel: pouvoir et
institutions, philosophie et humanisme, nouvelles orientations
scientifiques.

Introduction

T

he numerous visual metaphors that describe cognitive
processes hint at the nexus of relationships between what
we see and what we think. We say we ‘see’ when we mean we
understand, we try to organize and make our ideas ‘clear’ by
bringing them into ‘focus’, and so on. When faced with tasks
that require substantial thought or organization of ideas we will
often reach for a pen and paper to ‘sketch out’ (another visual
metaphor) our thoughts. We have a deep understanding that
we can enhance our thought processes by finding ways of
linking external perception with our interior mental processes.
Graphic aids to thinking are not new but the development of
computers has provided a new medium with remarkable
functionality. This in turn offers the potential for new research
methodologies that amplify cognition. These tools serve two
distinct purposes. One of these is often described by the
hackneyed phrase “A picture is worth ten thousand words”.1
This misses the true point of visualization as what is being
described here is just a matter of transmission, of having high
bandwidth to transmit large volumes of information. Of far
greater importance is the ability of these tools to allow visual
perception to be used in the creation or discovery of new
knowledge. Knowledge is not transferred, revealed, or
perceived, but is created through a dynamic process. This raises
epistemological issues concerning visualization and points the
way to an intellectual approach to the subject.
Computer visualization techniques began as a methodology for
understanding the meaning of large volumes of numeric data.
Scientists needed a means of visualizing the flood of data that
can be collected by modern monitoring and measuring
instruments. The National Science Foundation initiative on
Scientific Visualization launched in 1985 led in a very short
time to Scientific Visualization becoming recognised as not
just a methodology but a discipline in its own right. A similar
trend may now be developing in the Humanities. For example
the London Charter seeks to establish principles for the use of
3D visualization in research and communication of cultural
heritage that ensure the intellectual integrity of the methods

Digital Humanities 2007
and outcomes derived from it. How is visualization being used
in the humanities at the moment? Is there a potential counterpart
to Scientific Visualization in the digital humanities – a field of
‘humanistic visualization’? What issues does it raise? Where
is the common ground and what are the intellectual issues
involved?

Visualization in the Digital
Humanities

T

here are many ways of structuring an examination of the
use of visualization in the humanities; by discipline, by
type of information structure and so on. To set the context for
this paper I have chosen to look at the type of data that is being
visualized. The boundaries of data types are sometimes blurred
but a starting point could be as follows
•

•

Numbers. Quantitative analysis and visualization has been
an established tool in many humanities disciplines for a
long time. It is found in generic statistical analysis software
or embedded in specialised applications such as text
analysis. It is gradually permeating into new areas of the
humanities through work such as that of Franco Moretti
(2005) who has argued for a wider application of
quantitative methods in areas such as literary history.
Text: Visualization techniques using tables and graphs have
been commonplace in text analysis for many years. These
visualizations are sometimes variants of statistical
visualizations of numeric data (as in word frequencies) but
in other cases they are specialised visual forms of text
analysis. Projects such as the TAPoR and NORA Projects
are developing imaginative new visual forms and
applications. These new methods apply not just to the visual
representation of the results of analysis but also to the
visualization of the texts themselves. This aims to support
interpretive scholarship by allowing areas or relationships
of interest to be identified within large volumes of text.
Projects have explored specific texts in this way, for
example Dante’s Inferno , Hume’s Dialogues and The Shape
of Shakespeare but there is substantial scope for a tool that
could be applied to any text. The use of the word ‘tool’ here
should not be taken to imply that this is a computational
problem, this is far from the truth, as what is being grappled
with here are conceptual problems. For example, what is a
text? How should it be displayed visually? Humanities
computing provides a medium with a myriad of possibilities
of representation; uni-dimensional or two dimensional
physical objects, abstract objects showing relations among
words or between words and annotations, and animations.
Further questions arise from this work; is there a need for
representational as well as interpretive markup? What are
the relationships between text visualization and the

•

•

•

interpretation of texts? The visualizing of texts is also an
area which links humanities computing work to the arts, for
example the interactive installation Text Rain by Camille
Utterback and Romy Achituv.
Narratives and relationships. These can be grouped and
referred to as diagrams . Edward Tufte has drawn public
attention to this style of diagram; famous examples include
the work of Playfair and Charles Minard’s narrative graphic
of Napoleon’s ill-fated campaign against Russia in 1812.
In many respects this has been a neglected field since the
advent of digital tools because diagrams of this type are not
easily implemented in software. They are also potentially
of enormous value to the humanities as narratives and the
study of relationships between people, events and artefacts
are studied by many disciplines.
Space. The study of spatial relationships and a sense of
place occur in many humanities disciplines. This area is
dominated by Geographical Information System (GIS)
software but this was developed for scientific data and is
not ideally suited to the qualitative data used in the
humanities (Jessop, 2006). Digital dynamic maps are one
of many alternatives offering media that are better suited
to humanists (Jessop, 2006). The Electronic Cultural Atlas
Initiative (ECAI) with its utilization of Timemap provides
an indication of possible future developments.
Time. Digital visualization provides a very powerful
medium for temporal visualisation. Tools such as timelines
allow one to explore the development of complex historical
events and the inter-relationships between precursor events.
They are of obvious value in the study of history where later
events build upon earlier ones but they can also be applied
elsewhere. Historiography and literary criticism are both
histories of accumulated comments on a subject. Matt Jensen
(2006) has developed a number of timeline tools which are
intended to answer the styles of questions that are asked by
humanists, for example in the case of political scandals
questions of the style ‘who knew what and when’ or for
exploring the response to an author’s writing over a period
of many years
3D Visualization. Much of this work has centred upon
visualizations of the built environment. It is of interest to
not only historians and archaeologists but also anyone who
seeks to find out how the buildings of the past worked in
human terms, for example the Pompey Theatre and Theatron
projects are based on historical and archaeological data but
are primarily of interest to scholars of theatre studies. 3D
visualization is of especial interest in the context of this
paper because there is currently great deal of work focused
on defining not only good practice (see ICT Methods
Network) but also principles for maintaining the intellectual
integrity of such work, for example the London Charter. It
may therefore provide pointers for similar work in the
Page 99

Digital Humanities 2007
development of a broader humanistic visualization as a
whole.
Any demarcations between the applications of visualization
between different disciplines are misconceived. There is much
common ground offering considerable potential for humanities
computing and the digital humanities. This is where we need
to focus our attention if digital visualization is to achieve
recognition as a rigorous intellectual activity in research and
teaching.

Conclusion

W

e accept that texts and documents are produced as
readings resulting from acts of interpretation between
the reader and the text; we now need to regard images in the
same way. Every representation, visual or otherwise, is an effort
to structure an argument and as such it is a rhetorical device.
We need to understand the relationship between what is being
communicated and how it is being communicated.
Information graphics, and indeed images generally, can be
considered as historical artefacts themselves, filled with
interesting incidental and substantive information embodied in
their production, style, and graphical properties. But perhaps
more importantly, they are expressions of procedures for
generating knowledge through the act of visualization and ways
of displaying knowledge embodied in visual imagery (Drucker,
2003).
Visualization addresses epistemological and pedagogical issues
that are common to the digital humanities and are at the
forefront of the developing discipline of humanities computing.
This is a vast topic the main aim here is to identify some of the
underlying intellectual issues arising from visualization and
the use of images in digital humanities scholarship.

The Other Side of the Rug:
TokenX on the Willa Cather
Archive

University of Nebraska-Lincoln

[Schools] can only teach those patterns which have proved
successful. If one is going to do new business the patterns
cannot help, though one does not deliberately go out to do
that. My Ántonia, for instance, is just the other side of the rug,
the pattern that is supposed not to count in a story.
(Willa Cather, 1925)

Tools for text analysis have long been a focus of many digital
humanities scholars, yet the results produced by those tools are
rarely utilized in typical literary and cultural criticism. Though
the reasons for this disconnect are varied, we believe two
primary hurdles are visibility and accessibility. Specifically,
most text analysis tools and research are not found on the
sites—like thematic digital text archives—that scholars use
most, and most text analysis tools are not designed for ordinary
scholars, but are meant for those with more technical
sophistication.
Our essay discusses a novel approach to filling this gap between
scholars and text analysis, an ongoing collaborative experiment
in humanities computing to bring a "new business" that willfully
counters the "patterns which have proved successful" in literary
criticism in order to add a new dimension to literary research.
In "The Other Side of the Rug: TokenX on the Will Cather
Archive," we discuss the application of Brian Pytlik Zillig's text
analysis, visualization, and play tool, TokenX (<http://to
kenx.unl.edu>) to the Willa Cather Archive (<http:/
/cather.unl.edu>), a free, educational resource dedicated
to the study of Willa Cather's life and writings and edited by
Andrew Jewell. When this application of TokenX debuts in the
summer of 2007, scholars will be able to analyze the entire
corpus of Cather's fiction, from her first college publications
to her final short story. In many ways, our project is in the
tradition of research that seeks to use text analysis tools to arrive
at, in Ramsay and Steger's language, "suggestive patterns" to
"enable critical reflection in literary study." However, in
creating this tool for application on the Cather Archive, we
were faced with two distinct challenges: (1) how to develop
Page 101

Digital Humanities 2007
TokenX to make it capable of the envisioned crossdocument
analysis which is sensitive to changes over time, and (2) how
to design an interface that would make sophisticated text
analysis a manageable, useful tool for the widest possible range
of Cather scholars, scholars unaccustomed to using such tools.
The project is a interdisciplinary collaboration between Pytlik
Zillig, a Digital Initiatives Librarian with specialization in XSLT
and text analysis, and Jewell, Assistant Professor of Digital
Projects with a Ph.D. in American literature, both of the
University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Center for Digital Research
in the Humanities. The paper, likewise, is a collaborative work
that represents two distinct but complementary perspectives on
the issue.
Pytlik Zillig asserts that, for digital humanities, the development
and ready availability of tools to assist in the noticing and
appreciation of texts is of increasing importance. Unsworth has
observed that “by paying attention to an object of interest, we
can explore it, find new dimensions within it, notice things
about it that have never been noticed before, and increase its
value." For the first iteration of the TokenX/Cather
collaboration, the TokenX tool has generated a word frequency
data set containing nearly half a million data cells. These data
reveal the frequency of usage of words in fifteen TEI-encoded
XML texts, representing Cather’s complete corpus of
book-length fiction. This data set will be available for dynamic,
user-centered queries to assist in formulating theories and
facilitating explorations of Cather’s changing diction over time.
(See Figure 1 for initial results on ten sample terms within
Cather's corpus, detailing her usage of certain "body" words
within each of her published books of fiction.) If a text’s
common words are, as John Burrows suggests, "a barely visible
web that gives shape to whatever is being said" (323), then it
must be the ambition of tools such as TokenX to expose the
dimensions of that web for further inquiry. (Plans are underway
to add TokenX to the Text Analysis Portal for Research
[TAPoR], which will enable TokenX users to visualize, analyze
and play with documents stored on the TAPoR portal.)
Jewell argues that introduction of and experimentation with
new tools for engagement with literary texts are an important
way to make author-centric sites, like the Willa Cather Archive,
models of innovation. The audience of the Cather Archive is
not one inherently inclined to think about literary texts
numerically. The onus on the designer, then, is to consider the
sorts of research questions driving Cather and American
literature scholarship and to make this tool something that would
contribute to tackling such questions. For example, how might
text analysis contribute to a scholar exploring Cather's work
with a cultural studies or gender studies approach? What about
a scholar looking at contexts, themes, or references within a
single novel, or the fiction of a finite span in Cather's career?
How might this tool aid a researcher interested in tracking
Page 102

evolutions in Cather's prose over a long period of time? (See
Lindemann and the program of the 2005 International Cather
Seminar for examples of these approaches). By designing an
interface that is sensitive to a range of scholarly inquiry, one
that allows for a significant amount of flexibility and user input,
TokenX on the Cather Archive can represent an innovative use
of digital research that is brought into the mainstream of
scholarship. By demonstrating sensitivity to researcher interests
and seeking to design broadly useful tools, we demonstrate to
colleagues that such tools are not just for specialists, but can
enrich diverse arguments, any that find foundation— as most
literary scholarship does—on the use of words.

Macro Analysis (2.0)
Matthew Jockers (mjockers@stanford.edu)
Stanford

this tool valuable in assessing and quantifying the dominant
themes that occur in works where ethnic markers (words
denoting race or ethnicity) occur. This technique is derived
from the work of David Newman and his research team at the
University of California—Irvine.1
Another tool offers a type of literary time series analysis. Figure
1 shows a graph produced by my “timeline” tool.

A

t the 2005 meeting in Victoria, I presented a paper with
the revised title, “A Macro-Economic Model for Literary
Research.” That paper marked an early phase in a project aimed
at leveraging large, digital, text corpora for what I now call
“Macro-Analysis.” The work presented in Victoria was largely
a proof-of-concept using an electronic bibliography of 775
works of Irish-American literature. For that paper I performed
a dumbed down sort of macro-analytic text analysis using
metadata fields and the titles of works in the bibliography.
Today the software has improved significantly, and in place of
the title analysis of 2005, this paper offers results derived from
a macro-analysis of the full text of 1125 British and American
novels from the 19th century. In the presentation, I provide a
general overview of the tool(s) and an explanation of the
methodology employed in the analysis.
The tools and techniques I have develop utilize both supervised
and unsupervised text-mining techniques. The supervised
techniques allow for a focused analysis in which a researcher
probes the corpus for items meeting a specific research criteria.
A very simple example might involve tracing the behavior or
“frequency” of some “signal” (linguistic pattern, literary theme,
or author style) over the course of the corpus. I should note
here that while this process sounds similar in some ways to the
supervised machine learning approach being used by the NORA
project, it is specifically not like NORA in that I am not
employing machine learning or utilizing previous identified,
“marked,” training data. Instead the “signal” is developed ad
hoc by the researcher/user.
An easy way to understand the project is to visualize the tool
being used: A user is given an interface that allows for the usual
sort of corpus searching. The user performs a corpus wide
search for some term (or other feature such as a word cluster
or syntactical pattern). The result page reports all of the texts
in the corpus in which the search term(s) is found, and then the
user is given a “toolbox” of macro-analytic tools with which
to process and analyze the result set. These tools are varied and
perform diverse sorts of analysis.
A topic-modeling tool, for example, provides the ability to
harvest the salient themes from the text in the result set. The
user is thus able to say, for example, that works in the corpus
that contain word “x” show a predominance of the "n" topic.
In my own work with ethnic American literature, I have found

Figure 1

With the timeline tool, the results of any query of the corpus
can be mapped over time. Say, for example, that I am interested
in how some textual feature evolves over time. I perform the
necessary query to isolate the occurrences of that feature and
then choose the timeline tool. The resulting graph provides a
visual time-series analysis of the frequency of the pattern. The
graph shown here was produced after a simple search for
occurrences of the word “romance” in the titles of 7300 novels
from the 18th and 19th century. The raw counts are displayed
in red beneath each year. In addition to providing this timeline
of raw hits (figure 1), a second graph (figure 2) is also produced
that shows a normalized result in the form of “hits-per-100”
texts.

Figure 2

In this case, the normalized graph is particularly revealing
because it shows that the frequency of “romance” as a key word
in titles is not especially noteworthy. Aside from a very brief
period (1800-1810) where the word appears in 2-3% of all titles,
its use is steady at 1% or 1 occurrence per 100 titles in a given
year.
The macro-analytic tools developed in this research exist as
both command line applications and as a (beta) extension to
the open-source eXtensible Text Framework (XTF) application
developed by Martin Haye and the California Digital Library.2
The successful implementation of the tools into XTF has been
achieved with the assistance of Stanford Undergraduate digital
humanities major Jenny Loomis who will spend the final five
minutes of this presentation giving a live demonstration of the
tool as implemented into the XTF application.

Preserving Information About
Linearization in Document
Graphs

any operations are more conveniently performed on a
graph representation than on a linear representation of
a marked up document, and vice versa. Therefore, it is
sometimes important to ensure that no relevant aspect of the
information contained in a document represented in one of these
forms is lost or distorted when the document is converted to
the other form.
Conventional methods for converting between XML documents
and their graph representations [W3C 2000] are typically seen
to preserve such information; standards and methods have been
established for ensuring what is in most contexts considered
full preservation of all relevant aspects of the linearization
[W3C 2001].
However, what is considered relevant may of course vary,
depending on context of use. It would probably be hard to find
serious arguments to the effect that literally all aspects of the
linear representation of a document are relevant for any
generally interesting use. Typically, conventional conversion
methods are not guaranteed to preserve e.g. attribute order,
declaration order, and insignificant whitespace. But it is not
hard to find complaints about, for example, lack of preservation
of attribute order in certain applications.
Our focus in this paper is on methods for the preservation of
element serialization order in marked up documents which
make use of mechanisms for representing non- hierarchic
complex structures such as overlapping, discontinuous and
virtual elements. (For convenience, we use the term "complex
structures" to refer to such phenomena.) We do not wish to
claim that preservation of element order is always or even
generally relevant, our aim is limited to providing a method for
such preservation in cases where it is considered relevant.
The customary graph representation of XML is in the form of
an "XML tree", a restricted kind of directed acyclic graph
(DAG). More specifically, XML trees are DAGs with single
parenthood and total ordering on leaf nodes. For certain
Page 104

Digital Humanities 2007
purposes, however, a different kind of graph representation has
been proposed, the so-called Goddag [Sperberg-McQueen and
Huitfeldt 2000]: Roughly, Goddags are like XML trees except
that they allow multiple parenthood and do not require a total
ordering on leaf nodes; leaf nodes may be ordered only relative
to their immediate parents. (Thus, XML trees constitute a subset
of Goddags.)
For certain purposes this data structure provides a more
convenient representation of complex structures than XML
trees. Documents using different XML mechanisms for
representing such structures in linear form (e.g. milestones,
fragmentation, virtual elements etc. [Barnard et.al. 1995,
Sperberg-McQueen and Huitfeldt 1999]) can be mapped on to
Goddags, though not without knowledge of application-specific
semantics of the markup vocabulary. The experimental markup
system TexMecs [Sperberg-McQueen and Huitfeldt 2001]
offers mechanisms for the representation of complex structures
which can be mapped on to Goddags independently of such
knowledge.
However, in both cases, i.e. whether the graph is built from
XML or TexMecs, reserialization from the graph is not in
general guaranteed possible without changes to the structure
and order of elements in the original linearization. For example,
if an XML document has used milestones or fragmentation of
elements to represent overlapping elements it is possible to
build a Goddag representing the non-hierarchic structure of the
document. But when reserializing back to XML, the Goddag
does not contain any information about which elements to
represent as milestones or as fragmented elements.
Similarly with TexMecs: Some element structures can be
represented by alternative serialization constructs, and the
Goddag as currently defined does not preserve information
about the choice of construct in each particular case. In
TexMecs the problem is made more severe by the fact that the
graph does not, in the case of e.g. virtual or discontinuous
elements, preserve complete information about the serial orderof
elements in the original input.
Consider the following example, marked up according to
TexMECS, and illustrating how a discontinuous constituent
element <q> may be represented.
(1) <s|<q|Why|-q>, he said,<+q| me?|q>|s>
In TEI-based XML, the example could e.g. be marked up as:
(1’) <s><q part="I">Why<q/>, he said,<q
part="F"> me?</q></s>
The resulting Goddag, whether based on the XML or the
TexMecs input, would normally look like this:1

Since the second leaf node (containing the string ", he said,")
does not share any parent with either of the two other leaf nodes,
it is not ordered with respect to these. Therefore, the
linearization in (1) is equivalent to the following two
linearizations, both placing the second leaf node in a position
relative to the other two that it does not have in (1):
(3) <s|<q|Why me?|q>, he said,|s>
(4) <s|, he said,<q|Why me?|q>|s>
Thus, the Goddag in (2) would be the same whether built from
(1), (3) or (4). Similarly, a choice whether to linearize (2) in
the form of (1), (3) or (4) will either have to be arbitrary, or
based on purely practical considerations.
A solution to the linearization problem lies, we propose, in
considering the Goddag used for representing marked up text
as a path ordered directed acyclic graph; a Podagra. Building
a Podagra from (1), we get a graph consisting of three paths,
in the order indicated as follows:2
(5)
1. s → q → "Why"
2. s → ", he said,"
3. s → q → " me?"
Building a Podagra from (3), however, produces the following
path order:
(6)
1. s → q → "Why me?"
2. s → ", he said,"
whereas from (4) we get the following paths:
(7)
1. s → ", he said,"
Page 105

Digital Humanities 2007
2. s → q → "Why me?"
The Podagras (5), (6) and (7) all correspond to the Goddag (2),
but each maps uniquely to the linearizations (1), (3) and (4),
respectively.
In the full paper, we will present an algorithm yielding Podagras
from TexMECS documents containing different linearizations
also of overlapping and virtual elements. We intend to show
how path ordered Goddags can faithfully restore the original
linearization of such documents.
Since TexMECS is a purely experimental markup language,
these results may be said to have limited practical relevance.
However, a number of projects currently build Goddags from
XML-encoded documents (by the use of application-specific
semantics). Therefore, we also hope to indicate how the
proposed method may used for preservation of the original
linearization of XML documents using well-known methods
for representation of overlapping, discontinuous and virtual
elements.

1. For simplification, we are consciously ignoring certain unresolved
issues concerning the representation of discontinuous elements in
Goddags [Huitfeldt and Sperberg-McQueen 2006].
2. The simplicity of the example allows us to indicate nodes by their
generic identifiers. I.e. the three occurrences of "s" all indicate the
single node labelled s, and the two occurrences of "q" indicate the
single node labelled "q".

These four records are linked together by inter-record
relationships to form a complete bibliographic reference for
the chapter. Correcting the book information will thus correct
it for all chapters within the book.
There are a number of spin-off benefits in Heurist’s data
structure. In addition to all the normal field types –
variable-length text, integer, decimal, date, logical and
controlled lists – Heurist has three special field types which
reflect the needs of the data structure and the particular interests
of the research team:
•

H

eurist (HeuristScholar.org) – introduced at last year’s
Digital Humanities conference – is an online system
which integrates internet bookmarking with standard
bibliographic functions, and provides strong social bookmarking
and workgroup management capabilities. These include
workgroup-centred tagging, rating and data sharing (private
and public wiki spaces, threaded discussions and automated
notifications) as well as publication of dynamically-generated
subsets of the database.
Heurist is aimed at an academic audience. Signup requires
authorisation by the system owner and, unlike generic systems
such as Delicious or CiteULike, depends on social constraints
to promote data quality (users are identifiable rather than
anonymous). Heurist is available as a free service to academics
(sensu lato) worldwide. We plan to release it as Open Source
software in the course of 2007, once we have developed
peer-to-peer communication between instances.
In developing the bibliographic functions of Heurist we did not
wish to follow the ‘easy way out’ solution adopted by almost
all existing bibliographic systems; that is, treating each
bibliographic entry as an independent record in a ‘flat file’
database, using ‘generic’ fields with different meanings in
different record types and redundantly repeating data such as
book and publisher details in every chapter record.
First, we developed a method of recording variant records using
metadata instances (a technique we pioneered for the Electronic
Cultural Atlas Initiative metadata clearinghouse –
www.ecai.org), allowing for a completely flexible data-defined
and instantly extensible structure which handles missing data
and repeating fields with ease. Fields and record types are
soft-coded within the database and can therefore be added
instantly through a web form; data entry forms are created
on-the-fly from the soft-coded definitions.
Secondly, we construct complete bibliographic records by
‘normalising’ data into separate records reflecting discrete
entities, thus reducing data redundancy and all its consequent
problems. For example, a book chapter will be composed of
four records - a chapter, a book, a book series and a publisher.

•

•

Geographic objects: Heurist stores point, point and direction,
circle, rectangle, (poly)line and polygon objects. Geographic
objects can be entered through a browser-based digitising
function embedded in the data entry forms. We believe
Heurist is the only spatially-enabled generic bibliographic
database in existence;
File objects: Heurist implements a generic method for
uploading and managing files of various types – images,
text, spreadsheets, sound, video etc. Multiple files can be
attached to any record in the database and files can be
assigned specific roles (eg. logo, thumbnail, introductory
sound bite). Files can be embedded in output;
Inter-record relationships: Heurist has rich functionality for
relating a record in the database to any other record(s) in
the database. To do this it defines a special type of field –
a relationship field – which is a pointer to another record
in the database. Relationship fields may be open or restricted
to point to a specific type of database record. During data
entry relationship fields pop up a search into the database,
filtered to the appropriate record type. Relationships
between records in the database are then just another type
of soft-coded database record containing two relationship
fields and a relationship type field. Some tricky code handles
addition of new relationship types and directionality, so that
a parent-child relationship, for instance, is reversed to
child-parent if viewed from the other side. Relationship
records also provide a datestamp (the range of time over
which the relationship applies) and all the annotation
capabilities of other Heurist records (including tagging,
personal notes, wiki pages, threaded discussion, personal
bookmarking and searchability).

We have been able to use the relationship functions of Heurist,
combined with its flexible record typing and geographic objects,
for some novel applications. These include mapping a network
of research centres, projects, grants, methods, sites, researchers
and
publications
(the
3DVISA
network
–
heuristscholar.org/resource/45089) and recording a set of
historical events and their relationships to create a browsable
view of history (Silk Road TimeLine heuristscholar.org/resource/45317).

Page 107

Digital Humanities 2007
The underlying data for the Silk Road timeline is rendered as
a browsable list of interrelated events. When an event is
selected, all related events are listed, grouped by relationship
type – the web of relationships can be navigated by clicking
on one of the listed events to select it as the ‘root’ of a new list
of related events. The related events displayed in the list are
simultaneously shown on a TimeMap web map
(www.timemap.net) which is automatically updated whenever
the list changes. Links on the map and on the list allow
navigation between them and direct access to the backend
database records. The model can be extended to visualising a
different slice of history simply by copying the web page and
seeding it with a different starting record, or by linking a starting
record to the generic “Timeline Nodes” event which we have
created in the database (heuristscholar.org/resource/48600).
Our next step in this project is to develop a visual timeline
which is generated on-the-fly from the current list of events
and also linked to the TimeMap map and the event listing.
In this paper I will show how Heurist and TimeMap have been
used to build this generic collaborative content creation model
and visualiser for historical events, illustrated through the
example of the Silk Road timeline project, and discuss the
underlying data structures. I will discuss planned developments
in the data model we use to describe historical events, and our
research on improved visual methods of entering and viewing
the web of relationships between historical events (or other
types of record), including timelie visualisations. I will also
discuss specific applications of the methodology adapted to
museums, visitor centres, online encyclopaedias and the
classroom.
Heurist and TimeMap have been developed by the
Archaeological Computing Laboratory at the University of
Sydney, under my direction, as part of the Sydney Humanities
and Social Sciences e-Research Initiative (Heurist) and with
funding from the Australian Research Council, ECAI,
MacquarieNet and other user groups (TimeMap).

Introduction
The catalogue raisonné, or reasoned catalogue, has long been
a standard tool for representing large art collections. A typical
catalogue raisonné includes images of artworks along with
descriptive metadata, commentary, and background information
(often a biography of the artist) about the collection. More
recently, technological and infrastructural advances (in
particular, cheaper secondary memory, increased network
bandwidth, computational power, and digitization technology)
have enabled development of the digital catalogue raisonné.
Some of these catalogues have been developed primarily to
support the construction of print-based catalogues (Lanzelotte,
et al., 1993; Gladney, et al. 1998), while others are intended
for online use (for example, The Vincent van Gogh Gallery
and Gemini G.E.L.). The Picasso Project (Mallen, 2006) has
developed a digital catalogue raisonné containing 11,000 of
Picasso's artworks, along with 7,000 biographical entries. It is
the most complete and up-to-date collection of Picasso's
prodigious body of work.

Digital Humanities 2007
Building on the premise that the logical structures of the book
do not support scholarly inquiry adequately (McGann, 1997),
we are using the Picasso digital catalogue to facilitate scholarly
work with art collections. Researchers, students, and teachers
in disciplines such as art history, painting, drawing, history of
art, and art appreciation deal with art collections. They analyze
and critique individual works and compare and contrast these
with other works. They identify similarities between pieces of
art and trace threads of influence between artworks, artists,
styles, materials, themes, and social, geo-political, or personal
events. These scholars interpret artworks, identify missing links,
and communicate their findings. In the context of the Picasso
collection, we support scholars in expressing and visualizing
the complex, multifarious relationships between artworks via
a Web-accessible software interface.

Approach

I

n a series of informal interviews with faculty members from
art education, history, Hispanic studies, art history, and with
local K-12 art teachers we found a diverse set of needs, interests,
and approaches to working with artworks in both education
and research settings. One key theme running through each of
these areas is the need to discover and present relationships
between artworks, although the specific relationships of interest
varied by discipline. The art history scholar wishes to
investigate relationships between artworks displayed together
in an exhibition or to study works composed when an artist was
with a particular lover. The historian wishes to view art in the
context of significant historical events, for example, artworks
created while Europe was anticipating World War I. K-12
teachers are interested in identifying artworks that provide good
examples of specific drawing or painting techniques, such as
the two-point perspective or the use of complementary color
schemes.
In addition to the interviews, we also attended sessions of two
college-level art history survey courses. We observed that
instructors typically showed one or two examples of artworks
from different artists or art movements, discussing each for a
few minutes. In subsequent interviews, the instructors explained
that lack of time constrains their ability to include additional
works. Creating thematic sub-collections based on the
relationships discussed in class could alleviate this problem,
enabling students to study additional examples of materials
covered in the classroom. These observations of classroom
interaction and feedback from educators and researchers have
informed our enhancements for supporting the representation
and visualization of diverse relationships over the Picasso
project’s artwork catalogue.

building a network of semantically diverse, meaningful
relationships. In addition to the image collection, the Picasso
project includes extensive metadata related to these works, such
as its place and date of creation, medium, dimensions, current
location, as well as exhibitions and books in which it has
appeared. We leverage much of this metadata to express
relationships based on ownership, materials, patronage, or
chronology.

Interactive Relationship Visualizer
The Interactive Relationship Visualizer (IRV), an interactive,
Web-based application, enables visualization of relationships
that exist between artworks in the archive. The IRV interface
displays image sub-collections connected by the relationship
of the viewer’s focus. In addition, it presents connections that
exist within artworks in the sub-collection as well as those with
others in the archive, enabling users to navigate the intricately
interconnected hypertextual web defined by these relationships.
While browsing, the the display changes to reflect the dominant
relationship being displayed. In order to express a rich set of
relationships, we are augmenting existing metadata to include
type (such as still life or portrait), art movement (cubism,
fauvism, surrealism), and content (woman, nude, vase, mirror).
The IRV distinguishes two broad categories of relationships,
"inferred" and "specified." Inferred relationships are those which
can be expressed in terms of the metadata elements provided
for each artwork. Some inferred relationships can be expressed
in terms of a single metadata value, such as "artworks created
with oil on canvas." Others require mapping a range of metadata
values onto a higher-level concept and require definitions
involving multiple metadata fields. For example, identifying
"paintings created in Paris around the time of World War II"
is a two-step process. The system must map the timeframe of
World War II to a portion of the traditional calendar and locate
paintings created during this time. It then selects from this set,
those that were created in Paris Finally, relationships such as
"expensive paintings" involve subjective, theory-driven, and
potentially variable definitions. A price that would be expensive
in one art market might be comparatively inexpensive in
another. Inferred relationships provide a powerful mechanism
for exploring, discovering, and expressing relationships between
artworks that leverages existing metadata.

Picasso’s works cover a broad range of themes, topics, and
materials, thus presenting a rich substrate of artworks for
Page 109

Future Work

Figure 1: Interactive Relationship Visualizer system design.

In contrast to relationships inferred directly from existing
metadata, other types of relationships must explicitly be stated.
We refer to these as "specified" relationships. For example,
Picasso sketched several rough drafts of large works,
interspersed with smaller works. Thus, a chronological view
of artwork around the time the Guernica was painted results in
a sub-collection that includes these preparatory works as well
as other, unrelated works. Hence, this "preparatory work"
relationship must be expressed between early sketches of the
Guernica and the final masterpiece. Another specified
relationship is images based on a shared subject, for example,
Picasso’s interpretive series of works of Diego Velásquez’s
Las Meninas. Specified relationships afford us the ability to
define and represent relationships between artworks that are
difficult to derive from the descriptive metadata associated with
each work. This category of relationships is critical for the
expression of concepts based in established and novel analytical
approaches to Picasso's work—allowing relationships based
on information beyond that which is encoded in the collection.
The drawback is that participation in specified relationships
must be manually encoded.
Figure 1 displays the IRV system design. The Web interface
employs specific visualizations for displaying different kinds
of relationships. For example, the display of Guernica and its
preparatory images uses a visualization that illustrates the
centrality of Guernica relative to the other images displayed.
In contrast, the display of all artworks in the Las Meninas series
uses a table-like view, since no image is clearly central to this
sub-collection. We employ artwork images from the Picasso
project, reinterpret and extend existing metadata to express
myriad connections between these artworks, and facilitate
visualization of these relationships to support art scholars from
various disciplines.

e continue to add new metadata to enrich the
relationships expressed in our archive. While new
attributes enable us to express additional relationships, the
growing number of relationships gets increasingly difficult to
represent visually. We are investigating mechanisms to display
secondary visualizations without overwhelming the presentation
of the primary relationship views. As scholars analyze Picasso’s
works and life, the relationships of their interest are likely to
increase in complexity as well as variety. It is not possible to
express all imaginable relationships among these artworks a
priori, nor is it possible to have all the necessary metadata.
Enabling scholars to define useful metadata as well as
supporting them in forming new relationships will engage them
as partners in this project rather than as mere users.
The IRV has potential for exploration of artwork relationships
in the classroom as well as for evaluating student performance
via homework and papers. For example, students could explore
a relationship and write a short paper about the artworks it
encompasses. An instructor could create a relationship and ask
students to identify the relationship embodied by the included
artworks. Educators need assistance in the form of targeted
features for successful use of the IRV in the classroom setting.
We continue our dialog with instructors to channel the IRV’s
expressive power for enriching education.

So how do we decide when we’re done? What does it mean to
finish something? How does the “open ended nature of the
medium” (a phrase we all pay lip service to) jibe with the reality
of funding, deadlines, and deliverables? What can we learn
from finished projects, both successful and unsuccessful? For
that matter, how do we define success and failure? Are “we”
the ones who ought to be defining it? If not, who? This panel
attempts to begin formulating responses to such questions, by
bringing together practitioners and project leaders from multiple
institutional settings and contexts. William A. Kretzschmar’s
paper traces the local history of one particular project, grafting
milestones and markers of what its gotten “done” to various
versions and releases, a common enough convention in software
and information and technology. His remarks raise issues not
only for how one assesses closure, but also digital preservation
and version control. David Sewell addresses the questions I’ve
posed from the perspective of a publisher. His work at the
University of Virginia Press’s Rotunda digital imprint, itself
unique in the field, offers a very different context, one where
finding some measure of “done” is a financial and professional
necessity. Finally, the team from the Orlando project offers the
perspectives of one of the largest and longest running
undertakings in the digital humanities, at the moment when the
project has gone to press. The co-authors discuss not only what
is done, but also what will stay done (and relevant) only by
virtue of the ongoing expenditure of effort and resources, in
the form of continual upgrades.

Snakes Chasing Tails, or Every End is a New
Beginning?

Done: “Finished” Projects in the Digital
Humanities
Matthew Kirschenbaum
As the digital humanities continue to mature—theoretically,
institutionally, as a set of critical practices—there will be an
increasing desire to measure milestones, achievements,
completion, and closure. While one instinct might be to bristle
at such tendencies, and the traditional print-based scholarship
they seem to imply or infer, being pushed to formulate a more
fully realized set of responses can be a healthy exercise for a
rapidly expanding field. “Done,” as a shorthand convention
that has quickly become ubiquitous in the culture of professional
knowledge work, is emblematic in this regard, on the one hand
unequivocal and absolute, on the other hand useful only in the
context of low-level tasks that accumulate, often without finite
bounds or comprehensive structure, in the service of some
larger, less-defined endeavor. A server-side PHP upgrade may
be “done,” but what about the thematic research collection it
exists to support?

One of the motivating questions for this session is “What does
it mean to finish something?” As it happens, the word “finish”
can mean two things that have quite different implications for
large-scale humanities computing projects. On one hand,
according to the OED (sv) “finish” can mean ‘To bring to
completion; to make or perform completely; to complete.’ On
the other hand, the word can also mean ‘To perfect finally or
in detail; to put the final and completing touches to (a thing).’
In my own work of this kind, the American Linguistic Atlas
project (<http://www.lap.uga.edu>), we do neither of
these things. We cannot come to an end of the work because
we are witnesses and archivists of how Americans talk, and
they keep talking differently across time and space. Neither do
we think that our humanities-computing representation of our
research is capable of being finally perfected, of achieving some
perfect state, because the demands placed upon our research
keep changing. If we view the entirety of the Linguistic Atlas
Project as a “large-scale humanities computing project,” the
word “finish” is just not part of the deal. However, it is quite
Page 111

Digital Humanities 2007
reasonable to ask, as our granting agencies must ask, “what do
you want money for this time?” or “did you accomplish what
we gave you money to do?” From this viewpoint, the Atlas
Project consists of a series of particular tasks or experiments,
each one of which is capable of being “finished” in both senses
of the word. In this paper, I would like to discuss the reality of
funding, deadlines, and deliverables, as they relate to the
sequence of tasks that make up the larger Atlas Project. In so
doing, I hope to show the special character of work done
deliberately as part of a sequence for a large-scale project, as
opposed to work proposed as a singular task. The
contextualization of the separate tasks leads to special cases of
what it means to “finish” the work in either sense. The point
of what follows is not the Atlas Project itself, but instead the
way that individual tasks respond to the technical and academic
situation at the time, and how our work and thinking over the
years must change so that we can avoid the charge of being the
snake that chases its own tail.
The Linguistic Atlas Project Web site has been notable over
many years for its twin goals of interactivity for research
(including the use of GIS) and making its data sets accessible
and available to the public. I first programmed a GIS system
on the Mac platform for our Linguistic Atlas data in 1990 (Kirk
and Kretzschmar 1991, 1992; Kretzschmar 1992). It was widely
used for teaching and research on American English in the early
1990s, and it immediately led to breakthroughs in how we were
able to think about language variation data (Kretzschmar 1994,
1996; Kretzschmar and Lee 1992). The immediate task was
“finished” in both senses, but the larger Atlas Project required
more developments. While the Mac system was widely used,
it was limited by restricted storage available to distribute data
sets (at that time, chiefly through diskettes).
As the next task in the sequence, we then ported the system to
the Web, which I first demonstrated at a conference in 1996
(Kretzschmar 1996b). We had been working on an interactive
ftp/gopher system as early as 1994, but when Web technology
became available we saw that it enabled perfectly what we had
been attempting from another direction. The Web allowed us
to make all of our textual data available, with many additional
GIS features for locating speakers and information. The Atlas
Web was a significant advance for both teaching and research
(Kretzschmar 1997, 2002a), in line with the goals for an
electronic atlas first set forth nearly a decade earlier
(Kretzschmar 1988). After a while, we wanted to do new things,
so we began work on a major revision of the Web site that
finally came on line in 2003, which added even more interactive
choices such as more flexible searches and tallies of the
speakers and language data set. However, we kept "The Old
Site" as a link on the new one, so that long-time users would
find what was familiar to them, and also for users who did not
want the greater complexity that came with greater flexibility
of use. We could not just move it, however, because “The Old
Page 112

Site” had to run on a new platform and had to be compatible
with the extensive Python scripting that ran functions on the
New Site. The task of importing the Mac-based GIS system to
the Web was complete by 1996, but not finished until 2003
with the platform change and the final touches of the more
flexible site.
Still, the larger Atlas Project is nowhere near at an end. We are
now rethinking what the site should do, from a text-based
system to one that features audio and stored images along with
text and GIS. This change has become possible only in the last
two years, as much greater network-attached storage has become
available (measured in Tb, before long Pb). We are now the
one of the largest clients at the U of Georgia institutional storage
array (which we share with bio-informaticists, physicists, and
others usually considered to be power users) because of our
archival audio files, and we are just at the beginning for audio
and images. We now conceive of our new interviews as
conversational corpora, in which text transcriptions serve as
time-linked indices to audio files (Kretzschmar, Barry, and
Kong 2005; Kretzschmar, Anderson, Beal, Corrigan,
Opas-Hanninen, and Plichta 2006). While many users will want
to listen to our speakers, others will want to perform acoustical
analyses, now a strong trend in language variation research, as
we ourselves now perform them (Kretzschmar, Lanehart, Barry,
Osiapem, and Kim 2004; Kretzschmar, Kim, and Kong 2005).
Our next task is to integrate sound with text and to enable
acoustical research functions, while maintaining our interactive
GIS functions—a whole new set of tools and problems from
the previous task (Kretzschmar 2002b). New options for both
hardware and for text encoding make it possible to consider
the new site, just as the Web was a new option for the previous
task.
So, are we "finished"? Yes, with the GIS Mark 2 of "The Old
Site," but never finished either with keeping that site and its
successors available or with new approaches to the information
we keep as new technical possibilities and research demands
appear. We can complete particular tasks, and often we can
even “finish” particular tasks in the sense of polishing them for
improved use. Yet one experiment does not make the whole
line of research. One research proposal does not make the whole
research program. While we can succeed with each task, we
must always see tasks as part of the larger process that must
continue if future users are still going to be able to take
advantage of our resources. We would be the snake chasing its
tail if all we did was keep polishing a single task, but we do
well to make every end a new beginning as new possibilities
become available.
The implications of the Atlas Project situation for other projects
are definite and important. First of all, each project needs to
consider whether it wants to be a single task, or whether it will
be one of those continuing efforts for which any particular site

Digital Humanities 2007
or tool is just a single stage in a larger, longer process. The
reality of funding, deadlines, and deliverables makes it easier
to propose and defend the single tasks, but in many cases we
will be more honest, and better off in the long term, if we
recognize that what we are doing is evolutionary rather than
singular. We may have to work harder to convince funding
agencies to support long-term work like the Atlas Project, but
we must do that nonetheless. At the same time, our experience
shows that we can indeed identify separate stages in our work
that have independent value, and are thus fundable under the
demands of deadlines and deliverables. Indeed, the demands
of funding agencies can help those of us with long-term projects
to organize our overall effort so that we keep it vital, interesting,
and in the forefront of what new technology and standards can
offer.

It’s For Sale, So It Must Be Finished: Digital
Projects in the Scholarly Publishing World
David Sewell
Since late 2004, the University of Virginia Press has been
offering as part of its catalog a group of scholarly publications
that exist in online format only. Distributed under our Rotunda
imprint (<http://rotunda.upress.virginia.ed
u>), these publications are a mix of born-digital, digitized print,
and hybrid creations in digital humanities and social sciences.
Some of them began independently as self-published projects,
usually under the auspices of one or another digital center such
as the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities or
the Electronic Text Center at the University of Virginia; others
were initiated by the Press. Whatever their origins, once
accepted as Rotunda publications they have all been subject to
conditions of production similar to those for our printed books,
namely contracts, peer review, marketing campaigns, and
agreed-upon scope and deadlines. Clearly the academic
marketplace offers an extrinsic definition of a finished digital
project: if it’s for sale it must be done.
From this point of view, there is nothing inherently different
between print and digital scholarship. Academic publishers
have long been in the business of imposing admittedly arbitrary
conventions, limitations, and deadlines on masses of scholarly
discourse in the interest of presenting them as discrete units
that can be offered in the marketplace as completed products
(not just for purchase, but also for authoritative review and
citation). And this always entails negotiation between the
author’s ideal creation (which may well be both theoretically
unbounded and technically unachievable) and the publisher’s
available time and resources. The result is a pragmatic
compromise, one that has worked reasonably well for both
Page 113

Digital Humanities 2007
authors and readers. I would argue that the yoking of digital
humanities projects to theories of the open-ended text is in
many ways an unfortunate by-product of their initial emergence
during the ascendancy of postmodernist theory, with a
glorification of the unfinished that may harm their credibility.
When a publisher issues a scholarly article, book, or digital
publication, its status as “finished” represents a social contract
that the necessary stages of peer review, editing and design,
and quality assurance (proofreading, plus user testing for digital
work) have been performed.

mechanisms and/or institutions for quality control and
sustainability.

Here is one possible typology of digital projects according to
their degree of completion at the time of publication:

Orlando: Women Writers in the British Isles from the
Beginnings to the Present was published on the world wide
web, by subscription, by Cambridge University Press in June
2006 (Brown, Clements and Grundy). Its freshly researched,
scholarly, literary-historical prose is encoded in an XML
application designed for this purpose by the Orlando research
team and repeatedly revised and tweaked during the course of
research and writing. The searching functionality and the
production architecture were created at a later stage but largely
by the same team.

1. Self-contained monograph-like objects. All content and
functionality that is ever intended to be part of the project
is present at first publication. Future updates are expected
only for corrections and migration as required to new
software environments
2. “Version 1.0” digital projects. All substantive content is
complete at first publication, but not all planned aspects of
the user interface. Future updates are expected to add
functionality that was not originally available.
3. Series-like projects. Content is added in discrete stages; it
may be quite large in extent, but is definable. All intended
functionality may be present in the first installment, or may
expand as in category #2. Print analogues would include
literary or documentary editions published in multiple
volumes over a number of years or decades, and ongoing
reference works where new and updated entries are added
periodically.
4. Truly open-ended projects. The nature of the content, subject
matter, and/or authorship is such that no particular state of
the project could ever be meaningfully said to represent
“completion.”
To date, Rotunda has published digital projects that fit into each
of the first three categories. Their work flows and timetables
have been more fluid and sometimes more tentative than for
the Press’s printed books, but not different in their basic nature.
It has always been possible to define what will constitute a
finished project, outline the steps necessary to arrive at it, and
establish reasonably solid deadlines for the process.
I will provide concrete examples for several Rotunda
publications of decisions we have made in conjunction with
authors about what could or could not be accomplished by a
deadline, the distinctions between Version 1.0 and Version 2.0
features, and the kinds of updates we have found ourselves
needing to make to finished publications. I will also discuss
why the truly open-ended projects of category 4 are more
problematic for traditional scholarly publishers; our experience
suggests that they are the most likely to require new

Orlando Done! The Tension Between Projection
and Completion in Digital Scholarly Research
Susan Brown
Patricia Clements
Isobel Grundy

The project’s cofounders were new to digital humanities
research, so our notions of scholarly process and completion
related to conventional print publications. As Claire Warwick
has noted, the idea of what is “complete” or “publication-ready”
in academic culture has emerged from a complex set of human
factors relating to such matters as the attribution of credit by
institutions and funding structures, as well as the conception
of what is required intellectually for a product to be done
(Warwick 368). Such factors undoubtedly entered into how
Orlando got done. Although our projected milestones for the
project broke out a number of steps, our research plan and our
proposal to our funding agency had projected a single moment
of completion when the planned electronic history would be
ready alongside several related print volumes of scholarship.
Once underway, we found getting done more challenging than
anticipated, as the enormity of what we had undertaken on the
technical side became evident. This is clearly a risk of
methodologically experimental research of any kind, and
particularly relevant to digital humanities work. One thing that
seems crucial in the design of digital humanities projects is to
design projects modularly, with a number of discrete and in
some way publishable deliverables. Orlando struggled for
funding in later stages as a result, we believe, of research design
that end-loaded deliverables, combined with a funding
environment that was not attuned to digital humanities work.
It soon became clear that it would be necessary to stage the
completion of the project. We uncoupled the electronic from
the print publication in terms of timing, so that the former stands
alone initially, even though we will integrate the print volume
material, now being written, with the existing published
textbase. Although over the course of Orlando’s development
we felt some pressure from both prospective users and from

Digital Humanities 2007
the digital humanities community to publish at an interim stage
a small portion of the electronic materials, we held back for
two major reasons. First, we had a strong sense that there were
intellectual demands for a critical mass of materials with a
certain degree of coverage. We wouldn’t be “done”, for
instance, without having completed the materials on Virginia
Woolf and, because much feminist work has resisted the
establishment of a small canon of female writers at the expense
of others, Woolf needed to be situated in relation to her less
prominent contemporaries. Staging releases of material is
increasingly common for digital electronic projects, but we
would contend that a certain critical mass remains necessary
to establish scholarly confidence in quality of a resource,
although what that critical mass is will differ from project to
project. Secondly, because our customized tagset required us
to build a fairly complex XML delivery system, we felt we
needed a relatively “complete” interface, with some usability
testing, that could demonstrate to users some strengths of the
markup into which the project invested so much time and
intellectual labour. For these strengths of the system to be
apparent, we again needed a critical mass of materials for
hyperlinking and search results. Research conceptualization
and publication options are thus both crucial determinants of
what “done” will mean for a particular project.
Orlando’s decision to publish with an online press, in one sense
made it easy to know when the textbase was done. Published
is traditionally done (though even then, glitches in getting the
textbase up and running on the publisher’s server meant that
we actually celebrated the publication some days before it
happened). But published electronic projects don’t get put on
a shelf in a library. Being unconstrained by the materiality of
print reinforces the arbitrariness of deciding that something is
done in the sense of complete, defined in the Oxford English
Dictionary as “Having all its parts or members; comprising the
full number or amount; embracing all the requisite items, details,
topics, etc.; entire, full.” In this sense, Orlando remains undone,
and our contract with our publisher recognises this fact by
stipulating for updates.
Regular updating of content (more entries, expansion of existing
entries, more contextual material) has already, therefore, begun
with an update adding new material in January 2007. This is
an obvious publicity tool. Enhancement of functionality (quite
apart from action rendered necessary by, for instance, the advent
of a new version of Internet Explorer), though it may be less
productive of instant, visible returns than enhancement of
content for most users, is nevertheless going to be vital for
achieving the status of a first-stop general reference work, and
for retaining its currency in the evolving electronic environment.
This continuing updating of both content and functionality
means that the core team must be held together and the project
must continue to find funding. As part of its strategy of

sustainability, and with the purpose of giving Orlando a
continuing institutional identity, the textbase has been licensed
to the University of Alberta. This gives a much broader
constituency an interest in the project’s success, and ensures
that the team of this moment forms a continuity with the future
as well as the past. It would be easy to cast all of this
proliferating responsibility somewhat negatively, as though
continuing work on an already-published project were a burden,
but the fact is that all of the previous research, writing and
encoding that has been done towards publication will work
together with user feedback to enable new and newly informed
research. Both expansion of content (even into new areas) and
enhancement of functionality represent continuing research
potential, even while they ensure that “done” can – need? -never be anything but a figure of speech.
Apart from the issues of sustainability, the degree of Orlando’s
long-term success still hangs in the balance. Publication is,
potentially, the beginning of the road to success, not its end.
We would define success not merely as the selling of
subscriptions (though obviously Orlando needs to do well in
the marketplace if a substantial portion of its funding needs are
to be met from royalties), but also as the establishing and
maintaining of a pattern of heavy use of the textbase by its
subscribers: indeed, a pattern of reliance on it as the first stop
for either specialist or general information. We would further
define it as having users exploit the broad range of possibilities
represented by the encoding.
This abstract, written four months after publication, is in every
way provisional, but it is clear from early (and so far highly
encouraging) user feedback in the form of emails and a single
brief review that for most of our users the electronic side of the
textbase is ancillary to the content. They comment on content,
apparently assuming that the new resource should stand or fall
on content alone. Nevertheless, those who built the textbase
understand that this feedback must be to a large extent
influenced by the users’ responses, not directly articulated and
perhaps not even consciously formulated, to Orlando’s
functionality.
At this early stage most user messages come from the
literary-specialist part of an audience which will hopefully also
take in computing specialists and general readers. Most
messages comment on the coverage of individual authors (or
very particular groups of authors), on whom the commenting
user tends to be an expert, so that feedback is skewed both
towards the literary and towards the individual author entries,
which are in electronic terms the least sophisticated part of the
text. Several user messages have praised the “links”. This likely
means the hyperlinking of words tagged as names, organization
names, titles, or places. Such linking is an obvious and
elementary feature of myriad electronic texts. It seems therefore
that users who said they appreciated the links probably had in
Page 115

Digital Humanities 2007
mind the way that the encoding sorts and organises the contexts
in which linked words are used, and the very particular design
of the links screen to convey this information. Messages which
praise the searching, or the navigation, are even harder to
decode.
We look forward to more comment on functionality and
production, and further reports from general-interest users who
have begun, for instance, by looking at coverage of gardening,
as well as to a breakdown of statistics about kinds of use. In
addition, we want to undertake standard usability testing. Log
analysis would also be invaluable if we could overcome some
technical hurdles. This sense in which work on Orlando remains
“undone” should be common to most digital humanities
projects: if we are to evolve useful tools and resources, both
our own and those to come, we need carefully to assess how
people approach and use them.
This project directs its research towards two practically
inexhaustible fields (women’s literary history and the capacity
of computing, and specifically of extensive XML markup, to
serve the needs of this humanities topic). Neither of those fields
becomes closed to further investigation by the fact that the
project is “done” in the sense that it has reached the public. For
this project, so closely focused on its major deliverable, the
new, post-publication phase has simply opened a third area of
enquiry: that of the relations between Orlando and its users.

Problem Space and Context

T

he Southern Changes Digital Archive is a digital
collection of 25 years of Southern Changes, a publication
of the Southern Regional Council.1 The Beck Center of
Woodruff Library has digitized the issues of Southern Changes
and made them available as a fully searchable text archive. 2
The collection consists of 25 volumes, over 100 issues,
containing nearly 1000 articles.
Emory University is participating in the Digital Library
Federation's Aquifer Project and the Southern Changes Digital
Archive is one of the bodies of work that we proposed to
include. As we inspected the elements of the MODS Aquifer
schema,3 it became clear to us that every item in the metadata
collection would end up with identical labeling, since the
collection lacked subject assignments for the individual articles.
Thus, the challenge that we faced, in order to make this material
useful to users of the MODS-Aquifer metadata, was to assign
subject classifications to each of the articles in the collection
with some level of automation and a minimum level of human
intervention (given the ~1000 individual articles). We also
realized that this undertaking would help to make the collection
more browseable by providing a subject-based access point
into the digital library. To achieve these ends, we turned to the
tools and techniques developed on the MetaCombine project
here at Emory.

Semantic Clustering in the DL
Production Environment

S

emantic clustering is the notion of using computing
techniques to group formerly unorganized artifacts based
on latent aspects of meaning. For library information, this
translates into grouping texts and metadata records by their
Page 116

Digital Humanities 2007
inherent “topics.” Semantic clustering techniques have come
far in recent years, and hold great promise for enriching many
information applications. However, there is a wide gulf between
the state-of-the-art research in this area, and its uptake in
real-world applications.

rather than another quantitative test of clustering or
classification accuracy for the particular algorithmic kernel.

A major reason for this disjunct is that research systems for
semantic clustering (and related techniques such as
classification) are not fit for the production environment: they
are too ad hoc, too brittle, too encumbered by intellectual
property constraints, too specialized, poorly organized, and
they typically require programming to deploy in the local
computing environment and adapt into situational use.

W

But there is another factor that is more interesting for this study:
that the automated aspect of semantic clustering covers only
part of the production process; as we found on the
MetaCombine 4 project (and which many others confirm), some
human refinement is always needed. However, tools and
facilities which mesh the automatic with the manual to perform
this refinement seem to be unavailable.

1. interface the collection with the clustering system
2. perform clustering with a variety of parameter settings
3. explore and refine output in MetaCombine tools (HTML
reports, scheme editor, visual viewer).
4. implement refinements to clustering (tweak parameters, fix
bugs)
5. implement refinements to MetaCombine tools programs
6. go to step 2.

In sum, there exist few (if any) turnkey systems that are
accessible to digital librarians which allow the integration of
semantic clustering into the DL environment.
We began taking steps to address these problems on the
MetaCombine project, by adding to core semantic clustering
systems a some HTML-based report, a visual browsing
application and a “scheme editing” system. All of these systems
operated on the "raw" outputs of semantic clustering, and served
to help comprehend, navigate, and (in the case of the latter)
manually refine the output.
The central specific problems we found with semantic clustering
results in MetaCombine 5 were:
•
•
•
•

redundant clusters
confusing and otherwise "rough" cluster descriptors (labels)
spurious clusters
questionable classifications

The scheme editor was created to allow the revision of a cluster
hierarchy to ameliorate the above issues, helping to make it a
more true category (or subject) hierarchy, fit for end-use
applications (such as subject tagging and subject-based
browsing).
We have now begun the process of using these tools to work
semantic clustering techniques into production digital library
services. The focus of the present paper is one of these
real-world test cases: the Southern Changes collection and
digital library. However, key for our investigation is that the
library production environment itself is a major point of interest;
thus this work represents more of an exploration of the
application of the MetaCombine tools to this environment,

Our Study
e have approached the Southern Changes clustering
investigation as an informal study. This is both because
the needs of the Southern Changes project are practical and
because this investigation does not have the scale to have the
form of a controlled experiment or series of experiments.
The structure of the study is:

The study thus has an iterative nature and is open-ended, and
as we go through these iterations, we are learning much about
the nature of clustering and the contextualization of the task in
the digital library environment. As indicated above, our
clustering tools are also evolve throughout, moving beyond
research to practice.
The insights gleaned from this process form the core of our
reporting for this forum. The types of items we intend to report
on, along with initial impressions include (but are not limited
to):
•

The utility of the scheme editor, HTML reports, and other
tools

Thus far, these tools have proven quite useful for determining
the latent topics discovered by the clustering engine, and give
a basic level of understanding of what kind of documents are
assigned to each. However, it remains difficult to get a more
complete or holistic sense of how well a large number of
documents has been assigned.
•

The difficulty of deploying the tools

Thus far, the difficulty is moderate, for a librarian with some
programming experience. Some problems in deployment of the
scheme editor tool were isolated and future distributions will
have fixed them; so the difficulty level is improving.
We have not broached the topic of re-deploying the clustering
kernel itself for this project. However, this may not ultimately
be necessary, as we are pursuing a federated model for this and
other metadata enhancement services.

•

The utility of clustering itself

Flat (one-level) clustering seems to do quite well with the right
parameters and with the documents for which there is the most
confidence. Fidelity seems to deteriorate rapidly for hierarchical
clustering past the first level (with the first of two hierarchical
clustering methods), though it is still unclear if this is more a
result of the collection or the clustering system. Our second
method of hierarchical clustering needs further development
to be fully evaluated in end-use.
We believe we have established that the multiclassification
functionality of the system is extremely useful; as topical
ambiguity is compensated for by the multiple labels. This makes
intuitive sense, as there typically is no single categorization for
an interdisciplinary humanities article.

Figure 1:

It appears significant work needs to be done in thresholding
classification assignments, as well as making the determination
of if and when confidence is high enough to consider a record
“classified”.

The feasibility of integrating outputs of clustering into
production systems

As described in more detail below, we believe there will be
little difficulty in utilizing the outputs of this system, once we
have determined that output is satisfactory.
Given the proliferation of XML handling tools, at minimum,
our current, simple XML format for representing a clustered
collection organization should be easily translatable into our
existing digital library system. The most challenging part may
in fact prove to be combining the generated subject tags with
the existing TEI metadata structure.

Implementation Plans

T

he results of the clustering are XML files that contain the
renamed category, associated with the article by means
of the id attribute assigned to the article. We will apply an XSLT
transform to add an attribute that indicates the subject(s)
assigned to each article, using the TEI "ana" attribute. We can
then harvest the records with the subject information, and as a
further step, add a subject browsing capability to the web site,
using the "interpGrp/interp" elements. This will enable
dynamically generated categories for searching and browsing.

rt has never been a mere mirror up to nature, yet as in no
other medium has it been so easy to create a simulacra
of reality as with digital technology: a 'heterocosm', both
simulating the familiar while deconstructing it. This session
brings together three theoretical papers that explore how
mimesis might be used as a paradigm from which to explore
the relationship between the digital world, the analogue world,
and the space between them; digital surrogates and their
analogue counterparts; how familiar terms like object, imitation,
copy, original function in the digital realm; and the notion that
a digital representation may be more appropriately termed a
simulacral identity, reflecting, not the object itself, but our
beliefs and conventions about it. This session will explore
digital representation as conscious fashionings of hyper-reality,
computational zones or subspaces which employ the unreal and
non-existent to recreate the material world, pointing to the past,
and the future, in unexpected, fresh, or subversive ways

Being Digital, or Analogue, or Neither
John Lavagnino
When I speak of something being digital or analogue, I draw
on a connected pair of terms that is often thought to cover all
possibilities in a way that's theoretically well grounded. But
the origin of these two terms is not theoretical, and the
conventional opposition reflects a pragmatic view of approaches
to making computing machinery rather than deep and inherent
qualities of information. The two terms also do not exhaust the
world: most things are neither digital nor analogue, because
those terms describe information that has been carefully
prepared for machine processing. Nonmachines get by in the
world without that restriction of input.
The separate ideas of digital and analogue representation come
not from theory but from engineering. Digital representation
has its background prior to the days of the digital computer, in

the longer history of numerical calculating machines, and in
particular in the use of punch cards and tabulating machinery,
which could not only perform computations but provided ways
to manage large bodies of information. Analogue representation
goes back to a different tradition of calculating machinery, in
which physical operations that could be interpreted as
performing computations mattered much more than storage of
information in any quantity. In the mid-twentieth century, a
moment came when both approaches had significant
applications, and two separate strands of technological
development became a pair of options, both sometimes
applicable to the same tasks (Wiener; Mindell). Today the two
are commonly thought to exhaust all possibilities; but at the
same time there is a marked status hierarchy, as digital systems
continue to spread everywhere and analogue systems have a
minor or nearly invisible existence in unexciting devices like
thermostats. On this view, the digital has the prestige of being
made by us, and the analogue has the consolation of covering
everything that isn't manmade and a few things that are. Or, in
one very common version of this opposition, thought is digital
and reality is analogue.
Although many people assume in this way that everything is
either digital or analogue, most things aren't actually either,
because most things are not information prepared for machine
processing. All our machinery for processing information,
analogue or digital, has the common property of ignoring all
but a restricted slice of the world as we experience it, and having
no way to notice phenomena beyond that slice. We craft these
machines to work with particular inputs and sometimes learn
to change our behavior so that machines get the right sort of
input. Representations made for other purposes (art, in
particular) are based on selections, too, but because they are
not created to serve as a basis for computation they don't present
the same kind of claim to be authoritative versions of reality.
Nothing is digital or analogue until we actually get it into a
computational system; these properties result from our choices
about how to process reality, and are not inherent in reality
itself.
If reality is not by default analogue, thinking is not by its nature
digital. Much work in artificial intelligence has been based on
the hypothesis that the brain and mind work like digital
computers: so that, while our current systems might be crude,
they are still on the right path of development towards the real
thing, and it's important that the real thing is digital. The
hypothesis has been highly productive as a basis for useful
work, but is at odds with the biological account of how the
brain works; John von Neumann argued that the brain's
machinery was essentially different from that of both digital
and analogue computers. That difference is unsurprising, since
machines of other kinds work very differently from biological
systems with comparable functions. The natural form of
technology “is typically tiny, wet, nonmetallic, non-wheeled,
Page 119

Digital Humanities 2007
and flexible; human technology is mainly the opposite: large,
dry, metallic, wheeled, and stiff” (Vogel 271).
In one classical line of discussion of the digital-and-analogue
pairing, Nelson Goodman's, written texts serve as an example
of the digital mode: on this view, written symbols are intended
as discrete and unambiguous tokens chosen from a fixed set
(142). The way that texts lend themselves so naturally to
transformation into electronic form may seem to provide
evidence for this view: that they're not only readily made into
usable digital objects but that they inherently are such objects.
But in Goodman's account the digital nature of the alphabet is
an idealization: you are supposed to be able to tell your letters
apart unambiguously, yet we get by working with handwriting
and bad print that fails in this regard. Much more significantly,
we notice other things than the choice of token; as many
accounts of communication point out (Roman Jakobson's, for
example), there are many functions of verbal messages besides
the transmission of the information. Digital representation in
computers is different because they are designed to recognize
nothing but the choice of token; what is an idealized account
when applied to human use of the alphabet is a perfect account
of computing, because it describes how computers are built to
work.
Conventional accounts of digital representation rarely mention
how much of the workings of a computer are there to keep the
digital data digital, to prevent it from being degraded by noise;
works on electronic engineering never omit the point. We miss
a key feature of the digital and the analogue when we think of
them as static properties that happen to everything without
effort; they are instead deliberate creations. They have been
highly successful creations, representations of reality that lend
themselves to many uses; we ought to recognize them as our
creations, and not mistake them for natural phenomena.

Looking Backward, Figuring Forward: Modelling,
its Discontents and the Future
Willard McCarty
Alan Turing’s scheme has not been adequate to computing “in
the wild” for more than 50 years (Mahoney 1997: 621), but it
does have two fundamental implications for work in the
humanities. Its first implication is that intellectual gain from
the computational analysis of a cultural artefact comes primarily
from comparing it to its digital representation as this is
improved through repeated trials and adjustments. Its second
implication is that in principle there can be no limit other than
human ingenuity to the forms computing can take. Hence
computing’s basic tradeoff: on the one hand, reduction of the
artefact to computational form guarantees a permanent though
changing gap between its transcendent reality and its calculable
representation; on the other, the mutability of computing allows
for no end to the perfective attempt to reach the former with
the latter. This attempt I have called “modeling” (McCarty
2005).
The proposed paper takes the centrality of modeling for granted,
but it attempts to move beyond the inherent limitations of a
process that by definition only imitates. Modeling is directed
to a pre-existing conception of an artefact one wishes to study;
its strength is in contesting that conception in comparison
against one’s best attempt at representing it rigorously. The
discrepancies it discovers may well be, in Jerome McGann’s
words, “the hem of a quantum garment” that trails into our
future (2004: 201), but modeling gives us little help in
imagining that future. Turing’s scheme guarantees innumerable
forms of computing, but how best are we to work toward them?
Although, as Edsger Dijkstra remarks in his contribution to
Beyond Calculation: The Next Fifty Years of Computing, it may
seem “utterly preposterous” to predict this future, as teachers
we do it all the time in deciding what to teach, what to ignore
(1997: 59). As researchers we get hints of the future, or hopes
for it, when no existing data model, or way of using computers,
will do – when (to take an example from my own work) neither
textual encoding nor relational database design satisfies, and
we are left with a hunger for something other than what we
have. Can we do better than such backward looking glances
into the future? Can we imagine it directly?
One answer is supplied by Empirical Modelling (EM), presented
to the last North American ACH/ALLC conference (Beynon,
Russ and McCarty 2006) and further articulated in a recent
MSc dissertation (King 2006). EM focuses on the present and
presence of tacit experience, which is as close to the future as

Digital Humanities 2007
we ever get. Another answer comes out of work in critical
theory, e.g. by N. Katherine Hayles, whose focus on writing,
and cultural productions generally, lifts the gaze to what is
emerging – to “emergent” phenomena, as they are known
(1999). Taking clues from both, I propose to explore and talk
about a third answer arising from reflective work in the history,
philosophy and anthropology of the natural sciences. In the
philosophy of physics, for example, Ian Hacking has argued
that rigorously imagined entities are made real when we learn
to manipulate them (1983). In the history of technology, Peter
Galison shows that the devices we invent tend to pull us forward
into conformity with them (2007) – an argument quite close to
one Northrop Frye made at the first joint ACH/ALLC
conference, citing such human inventions as the wheel and the
book (1990). In the history of chemistry, Mi Gyung Kim
examines how 19th Century researchers worked to establish
the reality of their substances, suggesting a surprisingly
immediate interrelation of the imagined and the real (2000). In
biological anthropology, Terrence Deacon argues beyond the
uncomfortable limitations of a mechanical world-view and strict
Darwinian evolution to a new conception of teleology, “to
identify a real and substantial sense of the ‘pull’ of future
possibilities in terms of ‘pushes’ from the past” (2006).
In the proposed paper, I summarize this work in the natural
sciences and use it to construct a theory of emergence in
humanities computing. I base my exposition on the underlying
argument that use of computing, with its emphasis on “how we
find out, not… what we find out” (Hacking 2002), brings us
into productive relation with the experimental sciences without
in any way compromising our orientation to the humanities
(McCarty 2002, 2006, 2007). Sumarizing my earlier work, I
suggest briefly at the beginning of the paper how computing
has allowed us to create within the humanities a computational
zone or subspace, within which practitioners may treat cultural
artefacts as if they were only data, and so apply to them
something like natural law. I argue that the conjectural, as-if
status of what may be done within this zone gives us a
defensible way of importing powerful scientific conceptions,
such as Hacking’s realization-by-manipulation or Deacon’s
biological teleology, and apply them to our artefacts of study,
not in order to test what we think we know but to imagine and
realize what we do not know.
In earlier work I have used this conjectural relation with the
natural sciences to ground the practice of modelling in its
scientific past (McCarty 2005). Here I use it as entry-point to
speculations on how humanities computing might lead the
disciplines which it most immediately serves into a fruitful
relationship with the sciences and so to an end of the epistemic
wars foreseen by Richard Rorty (2000).

Beautiful Untrue Things: The Digital Dilemma
Susan Schreibman
In Oscar Wilde's dialogue The Decay of Lying, Vivian and Cyril
discuss the interdependence of Nature and Imagination, with
imagination, in that typically Wildean fashion, more faithfully
representing the real than the material world. For much of the
dialogue, Vivian reads an essay that he has authored to Cyril:
his thesis is that there must be a return to 'lying in art' (5): a
return to the roots of art in the purely imaginative abstract. This
imaginative work, rooted in the 'unreal and non-existent' takes
as its rough material life, 'recreates it, and refashions it in fresh
forms, absolutely indifferent to fact', to what is true or natural
or real (20).
Wilde's theory of artistic process can also serve as a starting
point in articulating a theory of digital mimesis; of
understanding the relationship(s) between the original and its
digital manifestation(s), as well as the relationship between and
amongst digital surrogates. Moreover, it can be taken as a
framework for exploring the complex and shifting relationship
between a digitally-presented hyper-reality and material reality.
As has been argued elsewhere, art has never been a mere mirror
up to nature, but in no other medium has it been so easy to
create a simulacra of reality; a 'heterocosm', simultaneously
simulating the familiar while deconstructing it. While the
mimetic effect of visualizations, simulations, and virtual reality
inherit a set of conventions between an audience and its
expectations of a work, these conventions are ultimately
unstable, shifting as the technology, and our expectations of it,
change.
Digital representations of three dimensional objects, necessarily,
lose their corporeality, becoming two-dimensional artifacts1
engaged with through the mediating presence of an electronic
viewing device (a computer monitor, a mobile phone, an
e-book). What we engage with, however, are only
representations of digital corporeality: what we see are
manifestations of the underlying code, much as the prisoners
in Plato's allegory of the cave saw only shadows cast on the
wall. What we engage with is in fact, not the digital object, but
a representation of it.
Page 122

Johanna Drucker in 'Digital Ontologies: The Ideality of Form
in/and code Storage – or – Can Graphesis Challenge Mathesis?'
posits that although throughout the Western history, images
have been charged with being essentially deceptive or
illusionary, the algorithmically-generated code of digital images
may, in fact, be a perfect representation of an object; a
representation which is not tainted through display or
representation. On the other hand, without the representation
of the code, the image exists outside our ability to perceive it.
In traditional discussions of mimesis the thing being represented
typically reflects, however distorted the lens, the represented;
the essence of the represented recognizable in the simulacra.
With digital media, however, paradoxically, to see beyond the
surface of the material world, objects are transmuted into a
series of electric currents represented to the computer as binary
code. What is being encoded is the object as it never existed,
a simulation or hyper-realization.
The intention of a simulation may be to represent an object as
it never existed in the material world reflecting our theories
and beliefs about it. Digital imagery may be used, for example,
to make visible the characters of a manuscript which are no
longer perceptible to the human eye. What is represented is not
the manuscript as it existed before the damage occurred, nor
the manuscript as it exists today: it is not the shadows on the
cave wall, nor the reality which casts those shadows, but a
hyper-reality which exists between these worlds
As more of our cultural heritage is represented in digital form,
the artifacts that people engage with are the simulations without
reference to the originals. These disembodied objects exist
outside time and space in a way that material objects do not.
Digital objects to not decay due to the ravages of time or
environment (although digital objects may be rendered useless
by our not having the proper hardware and software to read it).
Our display paradigms privilege certain readings of these
objects; they are surrounded by metadata, typically, if part of
a library's holdings, Library of Congress Subject Headings
which categorize and group the known world according to a
Victorian perception of the universe. Images are not represented
to scale, so a map that is 3x2 feet appears the same size as one
that is 8x10 inches. Our search engines reduce hundreds,
thousands, even millions of objects to a text string displayed
ten to a page, or a table populated by 40 2x2 inch thumbnails.
This homogenization of results further decontextualize digital
simulacra. These deconstructions of the object's material
existence reframe the relationship between the perceived and
the perceiver, refashioning it, as Wilde writes, 'absolutely
indifferent to fact' of what is true or natural or real (20).
This paper will thus explore mimesis from two distinct, but not
unrelated aspects of digital technology. The first part will
explore the relationship between digital surrogates and their
analogue counterparts; how familiar terms like object, imitation,

Digital Humanities 2007
copy, original function in the digital realm; what is lost and
gained in the transfer to the digital when the materiality of a
three-dimensional object is transmuted into a two-dimensional
plane; the concept of 'trusted digital objects': digital files that
will live on when we, and the objects they were created from,
no longer exist; the notion that a digital representation may be
more appropriately termed a simulacral identity, reflecting, not
the object itself, but our beliefs and conventions about it. The
second part will explore mimesis from the viewpoint of digital
representations as conscious fashionings of hyper-reality or in
Wildean terms, employing the unreal and non-existent to
recreate the material world in unexpected, fresh, or subversive
ways.

BFM Old French Text Corpus:
Current State and Prospective
Developments
Alexei Lavrentiev ( Alexei.Lavrentev@ens-lsh.fr)
Ecole Normale Supérieure Lettres et Sciences
humaines

T

he BFM (Base de Français Médiéval) Old French Corpus
was founded in 1989 by Prof. Ch. Marchello-Nizia, and
its compilation continues. Céline Guillot has been the project
leader since 2006. At present, the main corpus, BFM1, includes
74 complete Old and Middle French texts (approx. 3 000 000
words).
The texts included in the BFM cover a considerable geographic
area and an extensive time span, with texts from the 9th century
(including the first known French text, the Serments de
Strasbourg) to the end of the 15th century. Both verse and prose
texts are represented, as well as different domains and genres.
The initial aim of the project was to provide scholars with
reliable text data on the oldest period of the history of the
French language. It was meant to complement the Middle
French Text database (14th and 15th centuries) and
FRANTEXT database (16th – 21st centuries), both developed
in Nancy by the ATILF laboratory. However a number of
Middle French texts have been added to the database for
different projects.
By now, about 50 theses and a significant number of research
books and articles have been prepared with the use of the BFM.
All texts in the main corpus are digitized critical editions. The
choice to use editions, and not manuscript transcriptions, was
made in order to create an extensive corpus in a relatively short
period of time: transcribing a manuscript requires much more
time and funds than digitizing a modern edition. However, a
subcorpus of manuscript transcriptions is being developed. One
of its aims is to provide a precise evaluation of the reliability
of critical editions as a source of data for different kinds of
linguistic research. In general we argue that using editions or
manuscripts are complementary and not mutually exclusive
approaches to creating old text corpora (cf. Heiden & Lavrentiev
2004).
All BFM texts are XML encoded with the tags recommended
by the TEI. However some of them contain only a very limited
markup (headers with some metadata and page breaks or lines
Page 123

Digital Humanities 2007
in verse for reference purposes). A richer TEI encoding is
applied to a little more than a half of the BFM texts. Its
principles are described in (Heiden & Guillot 2002) and a
complete description is available at the BFM website.
The BFM texts are not directly accessible to users. They can
be searched by means of precise queries (e.g., discrete lexical
items, word and phrase concordances, co-occurrences, statistical
analyses, etc.) via Weblex search and analysis engine (using
CQP query language).
At present, several directions have been chosen for the
development of the BFM.
The first direction is concerned with the elaboration of precise
text typology, which is necessary to evaluate the
representativeness of a text database, a crucial question for all
corpus studies. The texts in the BFM are characterized by a
number of variables, such as the date, the region, the author,
the domain, the genre, etc. The definition of almost each
variable is in fact connected with a number of methodological
and technical issues. The date can be for instance that of the
original text composition or that of the manuscript. Author’s
age can also be a factor to take into consideration. Only
approximate dating is available for many texts and manuscripts.
Domain and genre are the main variables that contribute to
characterizing the reprensentativeness of a corpus (cf. Lee
2001). It is however extremely difficult to set a unified genre
taxonomy valid over a number of centuries. Many texts belong
simultaneously to several domains (e.g. religious and literary,
historical and literary).
To deal with this complexity, most of the variables have been
encoded by means of multiple fields in the metadata database.
Depending on the nature of a query, these can be used in
different ways. If the aim of the query is to get a list of texts
corresponding to certain criteria, “informal” fields with keyword
value type can be used. If the aim is to “cut” the corpus for
some kind of contrastive analysis, a unique value is selected
for each text on the basis of a formal procedure. If the aim is
to place a text in a multidimensional typological environment,
it is necessary to model the relations between the different
values of a variable and to quantify these values.
The work on text typology in the BFM is in progress, and we
will present its current state by the time of the conference.
Another direction in the BFM development is its linguistic
annotation. A few texts have been morphologically tagged in
a semi-manual mode (with SATO software developed by
François Daoust at the University of Québec in Montréal). A
complete automatic morphological annotation optimized on
the basis of text typology is currently envisaged. Annotation
of particular linguistic features (e.g. semantic features of

Page 124

demonstrative adjectives) is conducted in the framework of
related linguistic research projects.
The development of the BFM is closely related to that of
Weblex. A completely new platform making possible
personalized corpus creation and online annotation is under
construction.
An important effort is being made to work out consensual text
encoding and description procedures with the other projects of
diachronic French corpora. The TEI Recommendations are in
fact too general to ensure real corpora interoperability. A
Consortium for Medieval French Corpora (CCFM) was created
in 2004 with the purpose of consolidating efforts of different
projects. The BFM team participates in this consortium along
with Laboratoire de français ancien (University of Ottawa),
DMF team (ATILF laboratory, Nancy, France), University of
Stuttgart (Germany), University of Zürich (Switzerland),
Anglo-Norman Dictionary project (UK) and others.

Spanish American Colonial
Literature

T

eaching Spanish colonial literature to undergraduate
students is a difficult pedagogical task, because students
in that level don’t have an extensive knowledge of the language
of the times or the books’ historical context. Indeed, graduate
classes and even scholars writing in the field rarely grapple
with the early modern editions themselves, because of their
accessibility and because they can be so difficult to penetrate.
A scholarly collection of essays by Danny Anderson and Jill
S. Kuhnheim, that discusses strategies for teaching this material,
encourages an approach to these texts based on cultural theory
and literary criticism rather than on a close examination of the
texts themselves. At Wheaton College (Norton, MA), on the
contrary, we have spent the last two years experimenting with
a different approach: students’ direct involvement with a digital
portion of a colonial text (supported by digital cartographic
evidence from the period, and mediated by the faculty’s
suggestions) enhances their comprehension and interest for the
actual original book.
In three literature classes undergraduate students have
contributed to the creation of a digital critical edition of a 16th
century Spanish rare book: Libro de los Infortunios y Naufragios
(Book of the Misfortunes and Shipwrecks) by Gonzalo
Fernández de Oviedo, partially published in Seville in 1535,
as part of the La Historia General de las Indias (General
History of the West Indies). To date Fernandez de Oviedo’s
shipwreck narrative has received only scant scholarly attention

by literary critics because of the rarity of the book and
accessibility to the XVI century printed edition (Kohut).
The class goal is to produce a digital edition of Fernandez de
Oviedo’s book. The process comprises a variety of steps, aimed
to direct students’ attention to the texts themselves, their
structure, the meaning of words and phrases, and even of
individual letters. Students first learn to use accurate
transcription techniques and electronic textual editing practices,
and then move on to the text encoding based on an XML
encoding scheme developed by the Text Encoding Initiative
(TEI). We have found that using the TEI encoding is an
effective pedagogical tool because, as Allen Renear notes in a
article, the standard can “improve our ability to describe textual
features…. The TEI Guidelines represent an elucidation of
current practices, methods, and concepts that open the way to
new methods of analysis, new understandings, and new
possibilities for representation and communication” (235).
The TEI encoding project functions as a pedagogical tool to
study an Early Modern Spanish text; it helps students become
more knowledgeable regarding the primary text and the context
in which it was written. By using TEI students focus their
attention on three main levels: linguistic, geographical and
historical. While working directly with a text with the purpose
of encoding one of its portions, students have a chance to learn
across multiple disciplines, e.g. learning about the ancient
Spanish denomination of a place, and creating a link to its
location on a map of the times.
The encoding projects are divided into several stages. First,
students use text editing software to create a transcription from
digital images of original print editions – a process that involves
deciphering difficult 16th century typography and finding codes
to represent the many characters that are no longer used in
contemporary Spanish. After completing the transcription, the
students employ a rigorous, descriptive “tagging” process, using
the TEI XML encoding scheme. They begin by marking the
structural parts of the text – where each chapter begins and
ends, each section heading, each paragraph, and so on. They
then use TEI encoding to tag historical people names, places,
and unfamiliar or archaic vocabulary in the text. And as a final
stage of the project, the students perform appropriate research
about their texts, and using TEI, define all of the tagged people,
places, and vocabulary – essentially providing electronic
footnotes to the digital editions of the text. During this stage
of the project, students also work with scans of original maps
from the period – locating on the maps many places they have
tagged, and linking segments of text in their documents to the
scans.
This process presents many pedagogical advantages. Students
are extremely motivated by projects like this: they work so
closely with the text and end up creating their own annotated
edition, thus feeling a sense of ownership of the documents.
Page 125

Digital Humanities 2007
Many students are excited that this project reaches beyond
typical Humanities class work and that they see the results of
their hard work very quickly published on the World Wide
Web. The students' digital editions of the texts also help
preserve and eventually widen the distribution of out of print
texts. And finally, this project introduces an academic rigor in
studying this literature, which shows in the accuracy taken to
encode and validate the text encoding. Within the last few years,
Wheaton has been instituting a new curriculum that emphasizes
that students should gain a breadth and depth of knowledge
through their course work. The process of creating a digital
edition of texts like these ensures that students have an in depth
experience with a text unlike most other experiences they have
had in the humanities. This approach to a text encourages them
to apply a systematic, almost scientific approach to humanities
scholarship. This work, therefore, is well in line with the goals
of many of digital humanities scholarship. A goal, which Susan
Hockey expressed in a comprehensive article about the history
of the Digital Humanities: “to bring the rigor and systematic
unambiguous procedural methodologies characteristic of the
sciences to address problems within the humanities that had
hitherto been most often treated in a serendipitous fashion” (3).
Our experience teaching with TEI at Wheaton has been very
positive: students learn to understand and appreciate the original
rare book, only once they have had their experience with
creating the digitally enhanced version of it. At that point
they’re ready to visit a prestigious library like the John Carter
Brown Library at Brown University, and look at the book and
at the maps of the period. Undergraduates benefit from the text
encoding experience in many ways: better understanding of the
topic of study, better understanding of the foreign language,
and interest, or at least curiosity, for the rare book itself.
Assessment on student learning has been very positive: students
retain a lot more than with traditional teaching, and can
sometimes also spot irregularities and even fake news in the
texts they study. The load on the faculty member and on the
library liaison is very high, but it pays off with the students’
satisfaction.

T

racking the blogosphere requires at least (1) gathering
blog posts and (2) storing them in a structured metadata
store before any analysis and visualization can take place. Blogs
rely on syndication feeds, usually incarnating in the form of
RSS or Atom feed—both based on XML (Miller, 2001;
AtomEnabled, 2006). The first step is to properly process blog
feeds by retrieving, annotating, and storing the posts’ contents
in the feeds for later analysis. Our approach stores the posts in
a RDF-based (Shadbolt, 2006) metadata store Mulgara
(Gearon, 2006) waiting to be analyzed. Then, we use the
extracted text as the input of three different analysis and
visualization techniques. It is important to mention here that
our approach is based on statistics instead of more traditional
approaches based on natural language processing—from which
we may benefit in future stages.

2.1 BITS: Getting the relevant terms and excerpts
of a post

1 Motivation

B

logging has become a new and disruptive communication
medium. Blogs have changed the way people and
organizations
express,
interact,
and—quite
unforeseen—exercise influence. David R. Ellis’ film Snakes
on a Plane (2006) starred by Samuel L. Jackson became the
first movie to incorporate materials suggested by bloggers long
before the movie finished filming. A social mass of blog-based
fans influenced the Hollywood creation providing ideas about
plots and scenes that finally made it into the released movie.
The digital nature of the blog media provides access to an
always-expanding corpus of information. It would take more
than a lifetime to read all the available blogs necessary to
answer questions such as what were the more relevant plots
suggested or what key concepts were managed by bloggers in
their ideas. However, human-centered analysis and visualization
techniques may help users navigate such enormous corpus.
This paper presents how human-centered analysis and
visualization techniques help identifying relevant post portions
and visualizing concept relations in the blogosphere—Google
blogs in particular are used for illustrative purposes.

BITS (blog induced topic selection) is a ranking algorithm for
words and sentences in a blog. Higher ranked words may be
regarded as main topics used in a blog. Similarly, higher ranked
sentences express how key concepts are used in the posts. BITS
is inspired by HITS (hypertext induced topic selection)
algorithm proposed by Kleinberg (1999). BITS ranking is based
on mutually reinforcing relationship between sentences and
words: important sentences include many important words and
important words are included by many important sentences.
The rankings are obtained by an iterative calculation further
details can be found elsewhere (Kleinberg, 1999). Each iteration
we update the score of each sentence using the sum of scores
of all the words of the sentence; we also update the score of
words using the sum of scores of all the sentences containing
the word.
This mutually recursive calculation provides two important
outputs: (1) the ranking of relevant words for a blog, and (2)
the ranking of relevant sentences. The ranking of words can be
regarded as a summarization of the topics discussed on a given
blog. On the other hand, we regard the ranking of sentences as
an excerpt extraction technique capable of providing relevant
excerpts of a blog and, hence, a summarization tool.

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents
a brief overview of the techniques and visualizations proposed
to track the blogsphere. We describe in section 3 how such

2.3 ISNP: Modelling posts elements
The text contained in a post can be turned into a n-dimensional
vector of features using text mining techniques (Weiss,
Indurkhya, Zhang, &Damerau, 2006). Each feature is a word
in a blog post once stop words are removed. Each vector entry
represents a frequency measure for the a given word—TFIDF
in our particular case (Weiss, Indurkhya, Zhang, & Damerau,
2006). This simple transformation enables the usage of machine
learning techniques as tools for exploring and understanding
the processed blog posts. ISNP (Identifying Self/Non-self Post)
is an algorithm and visualization technique to create predictive
models of posts on a given blog. ISNP uses the postbased
feature vectors to learn models that describe and predicts what
post belong to a feed. In particular ISNP induce linear models
based on support-vector machines (Vapnik, 1999; Cristianini
& Shawe-Taylor, 2000; Shawe-Taylor &Cristianini, 2004).
Once the models are learned, we can use them to: (1) predict
pertinence to a feed given a blog, (2) compare multiple feeds
to measure degrees of topic overlapping, and (3) visualize the
key elements that identify self in a post.
The proposed visualization based on ISNP results allows the
analyst to quickly distinguish the main topics that characterize
a feed, and also obtain a measure of the existing overlap
between feeds from different posts. The visualization presents
a polar arrangement of the terms that distinguish self and
non-self blog feeds and the strength of each them—see Figure
1. ISNP also provides another visualization of how topics
change as new posts are added to the blogs feed stream by
displaying sliding windows of the TFIDF values across the
sequences of post of a blog—see Figure 2.

KeyGraph visualization represents concepts and their relations
as visual maps, favoring humanreflection. Moreover, it provides
a simple exploratory method to evaluate bridges between
concepts, fundamental building blocks of innovation and
creativity. KeyGraphs are usually presented nodes and links
using three colors: grey to identify high frequency terms and
links, red to display key terms and links, and green border nodes
to identify keywords—as shown in Figure 3.

3. Tracking the Google Blog

T

o illustrate the capabilities of BITS, ISNP, and KeyGraphs
we tracked the Google Blog (<http: //googleblo
g.blogspot.com/>) from November 10th to November
14th. A detailed description of the methodology and results is
beyond the scope of this paper and can be found elsewhere
(Llor`a, Yasui, Welge, &Goldberg, 2007). However, we present
some illustrative examples of the blog analysis and visualization
techniques proposed in this paper. Unless noted otherwise, the
results described below present the analysis of the post entitled
“Old world meets new on Google Earth”1
•

2.3 KeyGraph: Visualizing concept relations
When applied to blogs, KeyGraph (Ohsawa, Benson, &
Yachida, 1998) is a chance discovery technique (Ohsawa &
McBurney, 2003) which provide a visual map of the contest of
the posts of a blog feed. A KeyGraph is a graph where nodes
are words on the blog posts and links indicate co-ocurrence of
words in sentences. KeyGraph has been widely used as tools
to support human innovation and creativity in on-line scenarios
(Llor`a, Goldberg, Ohsawa, Matsumura, Washida, Tamura,
Masataka, Welge, Auvil, Searsmith, Ohnishi, & Chao, 2006).
KeyGraph starts computing high-frequency terms and
high-frequency links among them given the sentences of a blog.
Then, relevant low frequency terms (key terms) and links (key
links) are identified. A key terms and key links bridge high
frequency clusters together, flagging interesting transitions
between the concepts described by those clusters. Finally,
ranking high frequency and key terms based on the connectivity
degree allows the KeyGraph to identify keywords.

BITS. The BITS ranking provide the following terms as
relevant: map, earth, historic, explore, old, world, tool, and
cartography. The more relevant and descriptive sentence
of the post was: “I was able to explore and fly around the
old maps and use the transparency slider to compare the
old world and the new; as I did this, I thought to myself that
this is the perfect marriage of historic cartographic
masterpieces with the innovative contemporary software
tools of Google.” After reading the complete post not
reproduced due to its length it became clear that the terms
provided by BITS were an accurate description of the topics
discussed in the post. Moreover, the extracted excerpts by
BITS acted as a relevant summary of the posts in the blog.
ISNP. ISNP was used to learn models that uniquely identify
posts. The linear model based on support-vector machines
was able to accurately distinguish between the ten post of
the feed during the period of observation. Moreover, the
visualization of such models—see Figure 1— correctly
identified topic overlapping with two other posts talking
about Google Earth. ISNP also provided a simple
visualization of how term relevance changed through time,
identifying recurrent topics—Figure 2 displays recurrent
topics as wide areas on the accumulated vertical axis graph.
KeyGraphsFinally, the last analysis and visualization
tool KeyGraph provided a clear map of the concepts
managed in the overlapping posts “Old world meets new
on Google Earth” and “Know where you are”2, as well as
their bridging relations see Figure 3. KeyGraph clearly
visualize the two main discourse clusters provided by the

Digital Humanities 2007
overlapping posts, and also made explicit the connection
between them.

4. Conclusions and Further Work

T

his paper has presented how human-centered analysis and
visualization techniques used to support innovation and
creativity can also help to identify relevant post portions and
to visualize concept relations in the blogosphere. BITS, ISNP,
and KeyGraphs were introduced and used to analyze the posts
on the Google Blog for illustrative purposes. The proposed
techniques showed how humancentered techniques can easily
assist tracking the blogosphere for relevant information,
concepts, and relations, filtering the amount of information that
the analyst need to review by providing meaningful summaries
and visualizations.

The Digital Museum in the Life
of the User
Paul F. Marty (marty@ci.fsu.edu)
College of Information
Florida State University

L

ibraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage
organizations are creating digital representations of their
artifacts and collections at an astounding rate (Institute of
Museum and Library Services, 2005). The potential of increased
access to digital collections has tremendous implications for
digital humanities researchers, and many recent projects have
focused on the technical mechanics of digitizing cultural
heritage resources. While these considerations are extremely
worthwhile, there is an equally important need to explore how
people use these digital resources once they become available
(Cameron, 2003; Knell, 2003).
This paper explores the role digital museum resources play in
the lives of the users of those resources. It presents results from
an international survey (administered to nearly 1500 visitors
at nine different online museums) that addressed the relationship
between digital and physical museum resources in the lives of
museum visitors. The survey questions focused on how museum
professionals can encourage their visitors to form lifelong
relationships with museums: visiting in person when they can,
and visiting online when they cannot. The results of the survey
help museum researchers and professionals understand the
complementary, cyclical relationship that exists between digital
and physical museums from a user-centered perspective.
A growing number of researchers are interested in studying
how the many different users of museum resources (museum
visitors and professionals, information providers and consumers)
employ digital museum resources in their everyday lives (White,
2004). Museum professionals today work in a changing
environment where information resources are becoming more
technically-complex, and where the users of those resources
are becoming more information-savvy. Over the past decade,
the needs and expectations of museum visitors have become
increasingly sophisticated, and museum professionals are
increasingly concerned with ensuring that the right information
resources are available to all users, inside and outside the
museum (Marty, Rayward &Twidale, 2003).
To meet the changing needs of their visitors, museum
professionals have dramatically changed the way museum
visitors interact with museum resources. Increased access to

digital collections has removed many traditional barriers
between museums and their visitors, offering new opportunities
for interacting with collections and information resources.
Douma and Henchman (2000), for example, discuss an online
exhibit that allows visitors to digitally “strip away” layers of a
painting (Bellini’s Feast of the Gods), examining earlier
versions using simulated infrared or x-ray lenses. Gillard (2002)
explores how the National Museum of American History’s
HistoryWired project encourages visitors to manipulate a
collection of artifacts, uncovering connections between objects
along temporal, cultural, and thematic lines.
These changes have led museum professionals to express
concerns about the impact new information technologies have
on the relationship between museums and their visitors. Some
worry whether providing online access to digital museum
resources will result in a decrease in visits to physical museums
and a corresponding loss of financial revenue (Haley-Goldman
& Wadman, 2002). In the process of providing access to digital
museum resources, someone usually asks, “if visitors can access
these resources over the Internet, will they still come to the
museum?” The simple answer to this question is “yes, they
will,” and a number of recent surveys have shown that online
visitors are also physical visitors (Kravchyna & Hastings, 2002).
This makes sense; nobody asks, “if people can look at pictures
of beaches online, will they still vacation in Florida?” Similarly,
the ability to access digital museum resources online should in
theory serve as a lure, encouraging potential visitors to come
to the physical museum.
Despite this commonsense approach, worries about the
relationship between physical and digital museum resources
persist. Why? The truth is that these worries have far less to do
with financial remuneration than with understanding how the
users of digital museum resources perceive the integration of
those resources into the sociocultural fabric of their everyday
lives. To understand the relationship between digital and
physical museums, one must ask, “what role do digital museum
resources play in the life of the user of digital museums?”
Framing the question in this manner reflects a shift in
perspective away from the “user in the life of the museum” to
the “museum in the life of the user”—a shift that parallels one
that has taken place in the library and information science
community over the past few decades.
Very little is known about why users seek digital museum
resources or how users integrate digital museum resources into
their everyday lives, despite valuable studies that have explored
what visitors do at museum websites (Thomas & Carey, 2005).
Understanding the relationship between digital museums and
their users becomes critically important as more museums offer
digital resources online, and the number of visitors to online
museums increases to be five to ten times the number of visito.rs
to physical museums. If one wants to encourage a situation
Page 131

Digital Humanities 2007
where visitors make museums part of their everyday lives and
feel connected to museums whether they are physically there
or not, there is a need to explore the digital museum in the life
of the user.
To meet this need, this study explored the following research
questions:
•
•

•
•
•
•

What is the role of the digital museum in the life of the
museum visitor?
How can museums use museum websites to build stronger
relationships with their visitors, before and after a museum
visit?
What needs do digital museum resources meet for museum
users outside the museum?
When and how do people use museum websites before and
after visiting museums?
What do visitors prefer to do on museum websites vs. in
the museum, and vice versa?
How do museum websites influence the visitors’ desire to
visit the museum?

To answer these questions, the researcher developed an online
survey that asked online museum visitors about their use of
digital museum resources before and after museum visits, and
how they integrate digital and physical museum resources in
their everyday lives. The survey was advertised on the websites
of nine different museums, including the Fine Arts Museums
of San Francisco, the Science Museum of Minnesota, the
Australia War Memorial Museum, the Victoria and Albert
Museum, and the National Museum of Wildlife Art. From
October 2005 to October 2006, 1464 online visitors responded
to the survey.
The survey results provide valuable insights into the behavior
of visitors to online museums around the world. Certain key
findings from the study are summarized in the following list:
•
•
•
•

•
•

Online museum visitors consider it very important for
museums to have a website.
They are very likely to visit a museum’s website before
visiting the museum.
They are likely to use a museum’s website to determine
whether they want to visit the museum.
They have strong preferences for what they want to do in
the museum vs. what they want to do using the museum’s
website.
They are likely to visit the museum’s website after visiting
a museum.
After leaving a museum, they expect to be able to find the
museum’s website easily, and they rely on the museum’s
website to answer questions about the museum.

Page 132

•

•

They are likely to establish a relationship where they visit
a museum and its website repeatedly, visiting the museum
when they can, and its website when they cannot.
They are likely to visit museum websites in their daily life,
independent of planning or returning from a museum visit.

These results indicate that online museum visitors view
museums and museum websites as complementary, and that
digital museum resources are not likely to replace physical
museum resources in the lives of museum visitors. The users
of digital museums are constructing, mostly on their own
initiative, a complicated relationship between digital and
physical museum resources in their own lives. By focusing
solely on the user in the life of the museum, one sees only how
visitors use resources there, not how they make use of all
museum resources, digital and physical, in the museum and
online, in their own lives. Studies of the digital museum in the
life of the user, therefore, are more likely to paint an actual
picture of the complex interactions the users of museum
resources experience at the boundary of physical and digital
museums.
This study explores the broader implications of access to digital
culture by addressing the relationship between physical museum
objects and digital information resources. Much of the world’s
cultural resources are located in small museums, historical
societies, and community heritage associations—organizations
that are just now digitizing their collections. Without a solid
understanding of how people use digital museum resources in
their everyday lives, what good does it do those institutions to
create those same resources? If one is to create a sustainable
future for the digital humanities, one must improve the overall
understanding of how individuals use digital information
resources in ways that augment their appreciation and
understanding of physical artifacts and cultural heritage
worldwide.

Digital Editing, Infrastructure
Obstacles, and the World of
Virtual Appliances
Jarom Lyle McDonald
(jarom_mcdonald@byu.edu)
Brigham Young University

A

challenge that is often too daunting for new collaborative
digital editing projects is that of production and
publication infrastructure. The TEI Consortium has done a
wonderful job of providing a wealth of resources to speak to
this need for infrastructure support; with the online guidelines,
samples, and stylesheets, to the Roma customization generator,
to the (underutilized) TEI wiki, a project in the planning stages
has the ability to gather more than enough information and
advice for developing a solid infrastructure for software
encoding, database storage, web delivery.
Unfortunately, information and advice often isn't enough, and
projects which don't have access to sufficient technical skills
sometimes cannot even get their database installed, their web
server up and running, or their transformations working
properly. This lack of infrastructure support often leaves
promising projects floundering and potential digital humanities
scholars soured on the ability of technology to deliver on its
revolutionary promises.
There are some viable products that have become available in
the past few years specifically designed to alleviate this problem
of a general lack of infrastructure support. For example,
<teiPublisher> a Publishing system built on the eXist database
and the Lucene search engine, describes itself as “an extensible,
modular and configurable xml-based repository . . . designed
to provide administrative tools to help repository managers
with limited technical knowledge manage their repositories”
(http://teipublisher.sourceforge.net).
More
ambitiously,
Sebastian Rahtz has created a collection of Linux packages at
http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/teideb/ which provide instant
TEI-informed installation of such products as eXist, the Cocoon
publishing system, the Saxon XSL transformation engine, and
so forth. However such products are not in widespread use,
perhaps because those who need them the most are even
struggling with more basic infrastructure problems such as
getting a web server installed.
Enter the appearance of virtual appliances. The world of
hardware virtualization has exploded over the past few years;
Page 133

Digital Humanities 2007
IT professionals from a wide variety of fields have seen the
benefits of having a single piece of hardware run multiple
“virtual machines,” each appearing to be a real machine to the
outside networked world. Virtual appliances are small imprint
virtual machines, each designed for a different job, that can
reside on a physical machine and perform some sort of task in
relation to other virtual appliances (or physical machines) that
it is networked to. As appliances rather than software packages,
they are designed to be nearly functional out of the box, with
some basic configuration usually performed through a web
interface but with most of the configuration pre-installed,
pre-set, and pre-tested. Virtual machines and virtual appliances
have been successfully used in commercial and educational
settings to provide instant infrastructure support, allowing users
to concentrate on what their tasks are to be rather than how
things work underneath – in other words, well-designed virtual
appliances should function as turn-key devices, alleviating the
need for a given project to have a dedicated systems
administrator.
The purpose of this poster session, then, is to put forth the
concept of virtual appliances as an answer for the obstacle that
many digital editing projects face. I will create a set of virtual
appliances that can be deployed as a group—one will be a web
server, one a relational database server, one an XML database
server, one an XML transformer, and so forth—that forms the
core foundation of an online digital project. Each of the virtual
appliances is a configured “machine,” with only basic
information needing to be set through a web interface to each
of the pieces. A project hoping to utilize this group of virtual
appliances would perform the following steps:
1. A project will procure a physical machine.
2. The project will install the software to run the virtual
machines. In the case of this poster session, this will be
VMWare Server (free of charge), as VMWare is one of the
leaders in the development of virtual machine technology
(see <http://www.vmware.com/vmtn/applianc
es/faq.html>); however, conceptually, the same type
of virtual appliance network could be developed for the Xen
virtualization software.
3. The project will download the virtual appliances it chooses
onto the physical machine, one of which will be a central
control machine.
4. The project will use a web interface to the central control
machine to supply the relevant details—IP address, project
name, etc.
5. The project will then have an instant network of “servers”
that can act as a home for collaborative encoding storage,
database management, and web delivery of the materials to
be published.

Page 134

Obviously, there are many issues that my proposal does not
seek to solve—projects will still have to worry about creating
materials, for example, or setting up a higher-level front end
for accessing the materials. But even these problems might,
down the road, find a solution in virtual appliance technology;
imagine, perhaps, that one of the virtual appliances in this
network runs a pre-configured installation of teiPublisher, thus
providing a repository management system for project
collaborators. Another virtual machine might have nothing on
it but Roma and some validators, and act as a localized (yet
still networked) project schema management system. A third
could have a turn-key wiki for collaborative documentation
writing.
By seeking to use virtualization technology and the concept of
ready-made, plug-and-play virtual machines, I hope to make
the world of digital editing and publishing available to a wider
range of scholars and users. This new model of “software”
distribution—treating infrastructure as appliances—will
eliminate many of the lower-level technical obstacles that
prevent too many good ideas from finding a home in the digital
world.

A Network Structure of the
Synoptic Gospels Employing
Clustering Coefficients
Maki Miyake (mmiyake@lang.osaka-u.ac.jp)
Osaka University

I

n this presentation, we propose a graph-theory approach to
the systematization of the texts of the Synoptic Gospels.
Specifically, we apply a new graph-clustering technique for
data processing that utilizes a clustering-coefficient threshold
in creating semantic networks for the Gospels. Taking Greek
texts (Nestle-Aland, 1979) as the textual source, an adjacency
matrix for graphs is created from word co-occurrence data for
a given range of the texts. We also develop a web-based
application for the dynamic representation of the network
structures based on the relationships between words and
concepts.
Network representations are useful in modeling natural language
semantics (Stevers, & Tenenbaum, 2005). Recently, Dorow
(2006) has proposed the notion of curvature (clustering
coefficient) as a clustering tool to detect ambiguity and to
acquire semantic classes rather than using word frequencies.
The clustering coefficient represents the interconnective strength
between neighboring nodes in a graph. Following Watts and
Strogatz (1998), the clustering coefficient of the node (n) can
be defined as: (number of links among n's
neighbors)/(N(n)*(N)-1)/2), where N(n) denotes the set of n's
neighbors. The coefficient assumes values between 0 and 1.
In processing a text, word pairs are computed by a windowing
method (Takayama, Flournoy, Kaufmann, &. Peters). The
windowing method provides a relatively simple representation
of similarity levels that is suitable for clustering. The technique
involves moving a certain sized window over a text to extract
all fixed-sized word grams (Vechthomova, Roberston, & Jones,
2003). Word pairings are subsequently made by combining all
extracted words. Co-occurrence data is computed with two
window sizes that reflect syntactic and semantic considerations.
The first size is set at 2 for the nearest co-occurrence, while the
second size is set to 20 to collect words both before and after
a sentence. Morphological data for the BibleWorks Greek New
Testament Morphology (BNM) was used in a stemming process
to obtain base word forms from morphological variants.
Consequently, 2,688 word occurrences were identified.

In Figure 1, the degree distribution for the word occurrences
nodes are plotted in log-log coordinates with showing the best
fitting power law distribution (r=1.4). Following Barabasi and
Albert (1999), the feature of power-law degree distribution
indicates the small-world structure of the semantic network.
Figure 2 is a plot for the clustering coefficient as a function of
degree. There are 16 words that have a clustering coefficient
value of less than 0.1. These are articles, prepositions, pronouns,
and conjunctions, which are usually regarded as "noise" words.
We use the clustering coefficient value as a threshold in order
to eliminate such noise words and to control the datasets for
graph clustering. In applying the clustering technique, nine
datasets were created with 0.1 increments in the value of the
clustering coefficient (from 0.1 to 0.9). The datasets for each
window size were converted into adjacency matrices for
Recurrent Markov Clustering (RMCL) (Jung, Miyake, &
Akama, 2006).
RMCL is an improved form of Markov Clustering (MCL) (van
Dongen, 2000). The MCL algorithm is based on random walks
for a graph, and its model simulates flow by using the two
simple algebraic operations of expansion and inflation on the
stochastic transition matrix. The method has been applied to a
number of corpora, such as a French synonym dictionary
(Gfeller, 2005) and the British National Corpus (Dorow,
Widdows, Ling, Eckmann, Danilo, and Moses, 2005). In
contrast, RMCL allows for greater control over the sizes of
concept domains by modifying graph granularity and the
generality of concepts. The recurrent process gets feedback
from the state of overlapping clustering before the output of
MCL. This reversal procedure is a key feature of RMCL in
generating a virtual adjacency matrix for the non overlapping
clusters as a resultant state of convergence actually yielded by
the MCL process. The resultant downsized matrix provides a
simpler graph of the conceptual structures underlying similar
words.
Figure 3 shows the transitions in cluster sizes for the MCL and
RMCL processes as a function of the clustering coefficient with
a window size of 2, while Figure 4 shows similar data with a
window size of 20. The term input data refers to the initial
adjacency matrices. Figure 4 indicates that while cluster sizes
are almost identical for RMCL and MCL at clustering
coefficient values of 0.6 or more, RMCL clearly yields smaller
clusters at values of 0.5 or less. The MCL clustering results in
Figure 4 for the window size of 20 indicate the strong
connectedness between nodes, as all nodes are grouped into a
single cluster for coefficient values of 0.2 or less.
The results for both the MCL and RMCL processes are
implemented as graph network structures in a web application,
which has been developed to dynamically represent the
relationships between words and how MCL components might
correspond to concepts. Figure 5 is a screen shot of the web

application, which uses Apache2 as an http server and Tomcat5
as a JSP and servlet engine. WebMathematica is used to call a
Mathematica kernal to calculate the graphs.
In conclusion, the clustering coefficient represents a useful tool
for manipulating datasets to eliminate noise words. The RMCL
methods allows for the creation of compact semantic networks,
which clearly present the relationships between words.
In future works, we will apply different clustering-coefficient
thresholds to detect ambiguous words, particularly words with
low coefficient-low degree values. We will also evaluate
systematizations of the Synoptic Gospels by biblical scholars
and explore the effectiveness of our approach in furthering
biblical studies.

he modeling and visualization of temporal
phenomena—events and narratives—is an important area
of research in the digital humanities that has received relatively
little attention to date. There are some exceptions. Matt Jensen’s
SemTime, Johanna Drucker and Bethany Nowviskie’s Temporal
Modeling Project, the Center for History and New Media’s
Timeline Builder, and Bruce Robertson’s Historical Event
Markup Language are important projects that have been
presented to or developed within this community. However, in
spite of these exceptions, the limits of work in this area are
clear when compared, for instance, with the closely allied area
of spatial modeling and historical GIS. In recent years,
interactive digital maps have become increasingly prevalent.
In addition to the ubiquitous Google Earth, other map resources
produced by universities and textbook publishers allow users
to pan and zoom, hyperlink to related content, control layers
of spatial information, and select temporal ranges. However,
history textbooks are filled with timelines as well as maps, and
temporal thinking is critical not only to history, but to many
other disciplines besides. Nevertheless, in contrast to mapping,
the problem of modeling and visualizing time in an interactive
and digital environment has received almost no attention.

Page 138

Digital Humanities 2007
With the hope of raising the visibility of current efforts and
inspiring new research, this panel brings together six individuals
working in the area of temporal modeling and interactive
timeline development. Our goal is to introduce current
developments; to identify interesting and significant areas of
development that will make temporal modeling and
visualization into a robust field of research, and to discuss
models for an interactive database and historical event
visualization system.
Some components of a historical event model are well
developed. Temporal ontologies such as DAML-Time and ISO
19108 offer essential guidance for formalizing temporal objects.
The Historical Event Markup Language and, more recently,
the Named Time Period Directory Standard have developed
XML models for describing historical events. Creative efforts
to improve timeline visualization are surprisingly limited, but
there are several noteworthy exemplars. The MIT Media Lab’s
SIMILE project has an intuitive and flexible interface and
allows several timelines at different scales to be manipulated
together. However, it implicitly embodies a historical model
of individual unambiguous and unrelated events rather than
complex narratives, replicating the “tickmarks on a line” model
familiar from static textbook and wall chart timelines. By
contrast, the Temporal Modeling Project and SemTime are
visualization experiments that allow developers to incorporate
agency, causality and relationships.
Better handling of relationships is among most important issues
for future development of temporal modeling in the digital
humanities. Historical events have complex, multiple and
perspectivally unique relationships to one another. Historical
events and narratives also all have a relationship to spatial
information. Events occur somewhere, even when they are
global, and the same event (the Neolithic, modernity) may occur
at quite different times in different places. Finally, timelines
and event databases can be considered as components of holistic
information systems. All of these issues will be explored in this
roundtable session. Other topics that have not been addressed
by previous researchers in temporal modeling include the
representation of temporal and temporo-spatial ambiguity and
uncertainty, and the specifications for historical event systems
and services with multiple users. These topics, too, will feature
in our planned roundtable. All of these areas have implications
for modeling of both data and systems, and also for very new
kinds of visual representation.
The proposed Modeling and Visualizing Historical Narrative
Roundtable brings together a number of individuals who are
working actively in this area. This panel includes some
individuals (Drucker and Robertson) who have been researching
temporal modeling and visualization for some time, and others
(Johnson, Lancaster, Mostern, all affiliated with the Electronic
Cultural Atlas Initiative) who have worked primarily on spatial

visualization for history and the humanities and have begun to
engage in research on temporality as an extension of that
interest.
Ruth Mostern, as panel organizer, will introduce the panel with
a discussion of work-to-date on temporal modeling and possible
directions for future research. The rest of the panelists will
discuss their own areas of development, as follows:
•

•

•

•

Ian Johnson will discuss developments in the Heurist
generic collaborative content creation system and the
TimeMap spatial browser to create a model and visualizer
for historical events, illustrated through the example of a
Silk Road timeline project. He will discuss the underlying
data structures, planned developments in the data model
used to describe historical events, and research on improved
visual methods of entering and viewing the web of
relationships between historical events, including timeline
visualizations.
Lewis Lancaster will demonstrate the What, Where, When
and Who prototype for library catalogue searching and web
browsing. In this system, a directory of named events
extracted from Library of Congress subject headings serves
as the basis for structured searching. Searchers can browse
a library catalogue by using a timeline and a map linked to
the time period directory and a place-name gazetteer rather
than conducting a traditional text-based search. The user
may expand the search from a library catalogue to include
Wikipedia and other on-line systems. Named events, place
names, and personal names are interrelated to allow complex
search parameters.
Bruce Robertson will talk about the latest developments for
the Historical Event Markup Language. The first of these
is an RDF syntax for historical events that makes historical
markup of timed, labeled events associated with persons,
places and keywords simple for students and others. The
other development is the use of OWL web ontology
reasoning to express chronological reasoning (i.e. how we
know that the battle of Marathon was in 490 BC). This will
be associated with RDF reification
Johanna Drucker, an important researcher in this area,
regrets that she will not able to attend the conference due
to a prior commitment. However, she has offered to produce
visualizations based on her recent work to be presented by
the conference organizer.

Because of the large number of presenters and the desirability
of open dialogue, we are proposing a roundtable format. The
panel organizer and each presenter (including Drucker in
absentia) will make a presentation of 10 minutes. Each presenter
will discuss his or her current work and future plans in the area
of temporal modeling and visualization. This will allow time
for a moderated discussion among the presenters and between
the presenters and the audience.

Collex: Facets, Folksonomy, and
Fashioning the Remixable web
Bethany Nowviskie (bethany@virginia.edu)
Applied Research in Patacriticism
University of Virginia

C

ollex is an online toolset designed to aid students and
scholars working in networked archives and federated
repositories of humanities materials: a sophisticated
COLLections and EXhibits mechanism for the semantic web.
It allows users to search, browse, annotate, and tag electronic
objects and to repurpose them in illustrated, interlinked essays
or exhibits. By saving information about user activity (including
the construction of annotated collections and exhibits) as
"remixable" metadata, the Collex system writes current practice
into the scholarly record and permits knowledge discovery
based not only on predefined characteristics or "facets" of digital
objects, but also on the contexts in which they are placed by a
community of scholars. Collex builds on the same semantic
web technologies that drive MIT's SIMILE project and social
bookmarking systems like Connotea and Zotero, but it also
brings folksonomy tagging to trusted, peer-reviewed scholarly
archives and features an integrated publication system. This
exhibits-builder is analogous to high-end digital "curation"
tools currently affordable only to large institutions like the
Smithsonian. Collex is free, generalizable, and open source and
is presently being implemented in a large-scale pilot project
under the auspices of NINES.
Collex is constructed with pragmatic scholarly needs in mind,
and under the assumption that "the general field of humanities
education and scholarship will not take the use of digital
technology seriously until one demonstrates how its tools
improve the ways we explore and explain our cultural
inheritance – until, that is, they expand our interpretational
procedures" (McGann, Radiant Textuality xii; my emphasis).
Collex facilitates primary interpretive gestures of exploration
and explanation in a broad and socially-networked manner, and
aims to form a locus for further expansion of interpretive
methods in digital humanities.
The first formal iteration of Collex (released in February 2007)
federates more than 60,000 digital objects of 19th-century
literature, art, culture and criticism from the most prominent
and acclaimed online journals, archives, and repositories in the
field. This pilot project forms the core of NINES, the Networked
Page 140

Infrastructure for Nineteenth-century Electronic Scholarship,
a trans-Atlantic federation of scholars and of peer-reviewed
primary and secondary materials constituting a federated
collective. Endorsed by the NINES steering committee and
under development for the past year at ARP, the University of
Virginia's Applied Research in Patacriticism lab, Collex is both
the central clearing-house for NINES and the interpretive hub
around which we hope a vital community of scholars and
students will coalesce.
Humanists eager to develop new ways to integrate and explore
digital works currently lack crucial institutional and technical
resources. Even the best models that scholars of (for instance)
nineteenth century literature and culture now follow and imitate
— the Whitman Archive, Romantic Circles, the Rossetti Archive,
the William Blake Archive — are stand-alone projects that can
only be loosely integrated through web browsers, even when
shared through OAI protocols. As a consequence, what you see
now on the web is what you get: an agglomeration of sites and
projects whose content is atomized and whose scholarly and
educational value is indeterminate. While it is possible for
tech-savvy scholars, using ad-hoc tools and methods, to produce
and distribute annotated, re-organized, or selected versions of
existing online resources, they presently lack coordination
within a peer-reviewed digital publishing environment. Because
of this, their productions — personal web pages and online
course packets — are difficult to maintain, are not readily
interoperable or standards-compliant, and are easily dismissed
as heterogeneous grab-bags of links. NINES was founded to
work against this debilitating situation.
The inherent complexity of available resources is a further
obstacle to the penetration digital humanities into the
disciplines. Collex is designed to aid humanities scholars doing
research in complex digital collections like the Rossetti Archive
(its initial test case) or within federated research environments
like NINES. Such environments often stymie their users through
the sheer quantity of information made available to them in
top-level tables of contents, sitemaps, and idiosyncratic search
engines. Our tool operates under the assumption that the best
paths through a complex digital resource are those forged by
use and interpretation. A Collex approach works to assist
scholars in recording, sharing, and building on the interpretive
purposes to which they put their online teaching and research
environments.
Collex uses semantic web principles and technologies to explore
and develop the research potential of the digital scholarship
aggregated in NINES. Two critical concepts embodied in a
NINES environment shaped by the Collex application fall under
the rubrics widely known as "faceted classification" and
"folksonomy." Facets and folksonomies structure an approach
to descriptive metadata. They generate an evolving interface
between the fully-integrated peer-reviewed electronic resources

Digital Humanities 2007
that constitute NINES and the user communities that re-imagine
NINES content through interpretation, contextualization, and
critical and creative re-fashioning.
"Full integration" means that each of our NINES-participating
resources has contributed a package of metadata representing
all of the digital objects they wish to make browseable,
collectible, and available to users for re-purposing within
Collex. An important innovation of Collex lies in the way these
objects are defined by their contributing editors. Collex uses a
Dublin Core flavor of RDF, the "resource description
framework" of the semantic web, to define collectible "objects"
without limiting them to their expression as web pages. Where
other social bookmarking tools are designed to allow collection
and annotation of whole web pages, Collex allows contributors
of resources to make finer-grained distinctions, and users of
the system to build collections and exhibits more attuned to the
patterns of attention in humanities scholarship.
A clear example of interpretive modeling through object
definition is the Collexrepresentation of a book of poetry in the
Rossetti Archive. Using XSLT transformations, we have created
RDF metadata for intellectual and material objects at differing
levels in this book. One RDF object (typed as a secondary
resource, with supplemental genre and date identifiers)
expresses the editor's commentary on the book as a concept.
Another object, also articulated in metadata, expresses one
particular edition of the book. Within that high-level expression,
each page of the book has been shared with Collex users as a
collectible object, as has each poem on each page. Such fine
disambiguation ensures that Collex users can locate, annotate,
and exhibit objects specifically suited to the scholarship they
wish to perform – whether their attention is focused on
bibliographic, social, or textual matters. It also ensures that
archive maintainers have the fullest control, in the Collex
environment, over the use of their intellectual property and the
artifacts they minister.
Because RDF objects share a common (and relatively simple)
metadata scheme, they are discoverable through "facets" in the
Collex search and faceted-browsing interface. Faceted
classification is a non-hierarchical means of expressing
ontological relationships. Any given object will share a number
of facets with other objects – common dates, genres, authors,
etc. Exposing these facets makes it possible not only for users
to manually "drill down" into certain categories or explore
lateral relationships, it also opens possibilities for algorithmic
serendipity in research. In other words, Collex can exploit
formally-expressed facets to offer more options and avenues
to users interested in a particular object: "more like this" – more
objects in the repository sharing one or more attributes with a
researcher's subject of attention. Even more interesting is the
ability of Collex to record and analyze user activity, and to
translate the products of user interaction into RDF objects within

the system itself. In this way, in addition to "more like this,"
Collex can suggest to recent collectors of a particular object
that they view the published collections and exhibits into which
other users have placed the object, or objects like it. Because
this content can be expressed as subscription-based RSS feeds,
a web service, or an API, it is possible for the maintainers of
scholarly resources to patch into Collex directly from their
individual web page or listserv interfaces, offering information
about user annotations and re-mediations for any given object
without requiring users to visit Collex at all.
All Collex activity takes place within the ordinary web-browsing
environment that scholars presently use to access digital
resources, and will require nothing in the way of plugins or
downloads. The overhead (in terms of initial metadata
production) for contributors of resources to the federated
collections in which Collex can operate has also been kept
purposely low, and is thoroughly compatible with Open
Archives protocols. We predict that both of these factors –
combined with the strong endorsement and example of NINES
– will facilitate the adoption of Collex into day-to-day practices
of humanities scholars in networked research and publishing
environments.

A reservation I should wish to express is that customarily
levelled at digital projects, which is that while the technology
(brilliantly, beautifully, wonderfully) enables and indeed
encourages the presentation of multiple points of view, so
putting the burden of interpretation onto the individual reader,
there is a concomitant loss of genuine decision-making by
those claiming to be responsible for the work as a whole...
Editors should edit: will they?

to be recognised as important works of scholarship in their own
right.
For developers of projects that depend heavily on multimedia
or collaborative technologies, however, the answer to this
question is far less clear. While open standards exist for the
encoding of image, moving pictures, and sound, there is little
agreement as to how these are to be presented to the end user:
unlike text-based projects, multi- and mixed media projects
still commonly rely on proprietary software or specific operating
systems (e.g. Foys 2002, Reed-Kline 2000; British Library
Board, n.d.). And while many digital projects propose using
collaborative technology in their design, there is as yet no
agreement on the fundamental issue of how such collaboration
can function in a research culture based on peer review and the
preservation of authorial integrity. A number of exemplary
projects are beginning to show how such technologies can be
applied in specific contexts or to solve specific research
problems (e.g. Ó Croinin et al. [n.d.], Toth et al. [n.d.]). But
we are still far from agreeing as to how they can be used more
generally to support day-to-day research by working humanities
scholars.
The Visionary Cross project addresses this problem by treating
it as a research question. Our goal is to produce a mixed-media
and extensible edition of a key group of Anglo-Saxon artefacts
associated with the “Visionary Cross” tradition in Anglo-Saxon
England: the eighth-century Ruthwell and Bewcastle standing
stone crosses, the tenth-century Vercelli Book dream of the
Rood poem, and the eleventh century Brussels Reliquary Cross
(for this tradition, see Ó Carragáin 2005).

O

These objects include some of the best known and most studied
of the period. The Ruthwell Cross is a 17 foot high stone cross
erected near a former Roman military site in Dumfriesshire
Scotland. It is perhaps best known to Anglo-Saxonists for a
runic inscription that may be the oldest known record of an
Anglo-Saxon vernacular poem, versions of which can be found
in the tenth-century Vercelli Book and eleventh-century
Brussels Cross (see Ó Carragáin 2005, 58-60; O'Donnell 1996,
287-288, for bibliography).

For editors of text-based digital projects, the answer is
increasingly clear. The last decade has seen the development
of a relatively solid consensus as to basic technological and
generic expectations (see O'Donnell 2004 for a summary). Best
practice now expects that text-based digital projects will be
encoded using XML, preferably TEI. It assumes they will
contain an archive with transcriptions and full colour facsimiles
of primary sources; that some means will be provided for
comparing variant readings; and that users will be able to test
editorial assumptions by comparing or constructing alternative
editorial texts. While there is some debate as to whether
text-based projects have yet lived up to their original promise
(Robinson 2005), there can be little doubt they are beginning

The Brussels Cross is a reliquary that once contained a fragment
from the supposed True Cross. It is built on an oak core that
was covered with precious metal and jewels and perhaps a
crucifixion (stolen sometime before 1793; see Van Ypersele
de Strihou 2000; Webster 1984; Ó Carragáin 2005). Gilt silver
decoration on the cross’s back and side bands bearing a
vernacular inscription have survived. On the centre of the back
of the cross is a depiction of the Agnus Dei; symbols of the
four evangelists are found at the terminals. An Old English
inscription around the edge quotes from a version of the same
poem found on the Ruthwell Cross and in the Vercelli Book.
A second inscription explains that the cross was made by two

brothers in memory of a third. On the back we are told the name
of the artist responsible for its manufacture.
The Bewcastle Cross is a standing stone cross found, like the
Ruthwell Cross, at a former Roman military site. Approximately
the same size as Ruthwell and belonging perhaps to the same
artistic school, the severely weathered Bewcastle Cross still
stands in its original location (see Bailey and Cramp 1988). It
has the remains of a sundial on its side and may have been
painted and decorated with other metalwork or glass
attachments. The west face is carved with three figural panels,
of which two also appear on Ruthwell. The east side of the
cross is decorated with a continuous vinescroll similar to
Ruthwell; its north and south sides are carved with panels of
interlace, geometric, and foliate ornament. The lowest panel
on the west face shows a falconer wearing secular dress. This
usually is understood to represent the deceased man
commemorated in a now largely illegible runic inscription.
The Vercelli Book Dream of the Rood poem ties the members
of this collection together (ed. Swanton 1996). The Dream
poem describes an encounter with an object that is at once and
alternately a tree, a beacon (a word used to describe the Cross
on the Bewcastle Cross), a sign, and a cross sometimes covered
with blood, and sometimes covered (as in Brussels) with gold
and jewels. It ends with the Cross instructing the dreamer to
tell what he or she has seen and with the dreamer reciting an
expression of devotion and commemoration. The Dream is one
of only about 25 poems and poetic fragments known to have
survived the Anglo-Saxon period in more than one copy
(O'Donnell 1996; see also Orton 2000). If the runic carving on
Ruthwell is coeval with the rest of the monument, then the
poem has a textual history that is longer and more
geographically and linguistically diverse than almost any
vernacular poem in the period. The citation of a couplet from
the text on Brussels, moreover, suggests that it occupied a very
significant place in the vernacular literary imagination: the only
other known example of a similar verse citation in the period
is from the translation of the Psalter.
Together, these objects form a cultural matrix whose members
are associated along a number of textual, art historical,
liturgical, and archaeological planes. The goal of this project
is to use new technology to study these objects and their
relationships in ways impossible in print—or even in person.
Just as a textual edition improves upon witnesses by
contributing an interpretive apparatus, so to our edition will
improve on readers' knowledge of this matrix by placing it in
a hypermedia apparatus that will assist in its interpretation.
The value of this approach is perhaps most obvious in the case
of the crosses, which can be understood as multimedia objects
in their own right. In all three cases, the monuments gain
meaning from the interaction of text, image, and context. The
stone crosses appear to have been “read” by walking around in
Page 144

a direction determined by their geographical orientation and
the order of the Liturgy. The Brussels cross—depending on
one's view of the object's original function—would likely have
been seen by contemporary audiences either as an altar piece
or carried in procession (On this spatial aspect see especially
Ó Carragáin 2005).
The new technologies also allow us to ask new questions about
the objects relationships with each other. Had an Anglo-Saxon
observer been lucky enough to see all four in a single lifetime
(an impossible proposition given their temporal and geographic
distribution), he or she would have understood them both as
individual works of art and as part of a larger web of cultural
traditions and references extending along various textual, art
historical, and generic planes. By taking advantage of
hypermedia's strength in the representation of arbitrary
connections, we as editors can now represent these connections
to modern scholars in a way that translates and augments the
original artefacts—in our edition, linking becomes a type of
hypermedia collation. In our edition, scholars will be able to
both to study the individual objects as objects in their own right
and follow the connections among them. In doing so they will
have access both to a collection unavailable to any single
Anglo-Saxon observer and the benefit of immediate access to
the best of recent criticism and centuries of secondary
scholarship.
By using recent developments in collaborative technologies,
finally, we hope this project—like the cultural knowledge it
attempts to capture and represents—will be open to
augmentation as our knowledge develops. By using standoff
markup, we intend to allow developers and users to anticipate
connections to other objects in the matrix or discover new
connections among existing objects in much the same way
contributors to the Wikipedia can predict the existence of
articles that have yet to be written or contribute “stubs” for
subsequent elaboration while retaining intellectual ownership
of their contributions (see Ore 2004 for a discussion of
collaborative editing; O'Donnell 2006 discusses some strengths
and weaknesses of the model for scholars).
If multimedia projects are going to answer our reviewer's
question, they must learn to do more than simply display—they
must also learn to edit. This paper discusses the approaches we
are and will be taking to this important problem in developing
a complex multimedia “edition” of a cultural matrix.

LICHEN project, initiated by the Department of English
and the MediaTeam research group (Dept. of Electrical and
Information Engineering, MediaTeam 2006) at the University
of Oulu and the SCOTS corpus project at the University of
Glasgow (Scottish Corpus of Texts and Speech, 2006), focuses
on the languages and cultures of the northern circumpolar
region. Its underlying assumption is that language and culture
are as important to the survival and well-being of populations
as more obvious ecological, social and health issues and thus
it is also a member of the Circumpolar Health and Wellbeing
research programme run by the Centre for Arctic Medicine,
University of Oulu (Thule Institute 2006).
The aim of the project is two-fold: firstly, the project aims to
collect, preserve and disseminate information about the
languages spoken in the circumpolar region, thus also enabling
research on them. This will also help to promote the linguistic
Page 145

Digital Humanities 2007
confidence and self-image of the speakers of these languages,
strengthening their cultural awareness and facilitating
cross-cultural communication between these peoples in an age
of rapid global change (Winsa 1998).

the development of the computing tools is a shell which can be
adapted to any language. Therefore, support for multiple
languages and a variety of character encoding schemes are
important.

Secondly, and more importantly, the project aims to create an
electronic framework for the collection, management, online
display, and exploitation of existing corpora of the languages
of the circumpolar regions, which is also applicable to other
corpora that represent regional, social and other varieties of
languages. Humanities computing researchers, in particular,
have long recognized the need for new, more sophisticated
tools to aid scholarly research of textual data, not to mention
tools that would be able to handle multimodal data. Although
a number of tools have been developed, they suffer from various
restrictions, e.g. they are only applicable to the data they were
developed for, importing data is laborious, user interfaces and
encoding standards are outdated, considerable expertise in
programming is assumed, no support for multilinguality is
included, or they promise more than they offer. While there
have been some very promising advances made in this direction
(e.g. TAPOR Tools 2006), it is clear that more tools are needed.

The main focus of the project is on Meänkieli and Kven, two
Finnic minority languages spoken in Sweden and Norway,
respectively, and Scots and Scottish English. At present we
have about 150 hours of tapes in Meänkieli and 100 hours of
tapes in Kven. More Kven material is currently being collected.
We also have access to both the structure and contents of the
Scottish Corpus of Texts and Speech (SCOTS) at the University
of Glasgow, currently totalling 3.5 million words of spoken
and written Scots and Scottish English.

The framework being developed in this project is intended to
be the equivalent of an extendable toolbox for corpus linguists.
It will attempt to offer much-needed functionality in an
easy-to-use package, which is shaped and built-on according
to real user needs. Initially emphasis will be given to the
implementation of the text capabilities of the system, but other
modalities (such as audio and video) are also taken into account.
The idea is to facilitate queries into a multimodal database using
both proven and novel ways of finding and displaying
information (Seppänen 2006). Metadata and metadata
visualisation, particularly in conjunction with the new
modalities, will be essential in achieving this. While we support
the use of best practices for the collection, preservation and
presentation of corpus data, we also recognize that some data,
particularly legacy data, may not be in a position to do so and
the shell must also support such data (Kretzschmar et al. 2006).
The system will also make migration to and from other tools
straightforward by offering import and export features for
commonly used programs. It will enable users to bring in their
own data, which they can keep private or make public using
the built-in web functionality. The database will also be capable
of handling several different versions of any document (for
example, revisions, interpretations or translations); these are
linked, a feature that can be made use of in queries. Queries
can be made using regular expressions, which may combine
free-form text (words, phrases) and part-of-speech tags, for
example.
The system is implemented in Java making it platform
independent and taking advantage of the many technological
components developed for that language. The ultimate goal of
Page 146

The project began in 2004 and a prototype of the shell has now
been constructed. We will demonstrate this shell, showing some
of the basic functionality of the system while looking into
concrete research questions focusing on the image of
Scottishness as presented in Irvine Welsh’s Trainspotting
(1996). Since the story is found in novel, play and movie
versions, it affords an excellent testbed for a toolbox that can
handle multimodal data. Using a few key scenes as examples,
our research focuses on the questioning of national stereotypes
in terms of landscape, language and culture. We are thus
interested in the comparison of the images presented in the
three versions, which will also demonstrate the ability of the
toolbox to support versioning. While we concentrate on
linguistic features of Scottish English, we also demonstrate
how easy-to-use access to sound and images linked to the
transcription of the movie and the linking between the three
versions of the text greatly facilitate research such as ours that
must take into consideration images created both on all levels
of a text and across texts. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility
of making use of online dictionaries as an added tool in the
analysis of data from within the toolbox.
Since the shell is still in prototype form, we would welcome
this opportunity to discuss our needs and goals at DH2007, thus
drawing on the considerable expertise of the conference
participants in order to ensure that our tools benefit as wide a
range of users as possible.

Professor Ott delivered the 2007 Busa Prize Lecture under this
title. What follows is the introduction to the lecture, provided
by Michael Sperberg-McQueen.

to Wilhelm Ott. The members of the committee for this cycle

The members of the Award committee have asked me to say a
few words about the work of Wilhelm Ott.
Like many of us, Wilhelm Ott came to our field by a circuitous
route.
As a young man, he studied at the Collegium Germanicum, a
seminary in Rome, but, if I understand correctly, he experienced
some tensions with his superiors. As in the traditional university,
a four-year study of the liberal arts was required before students
were allowed to embark on the study of the queen of sciences,
theology. Herr Ott and some of his fellow students incurred the
displeasure of the authorities by sneaking across the road in
some otherwise unoccupied time, to sit in on a series of lectures
on Paul's epistle to the Romans.
And then, in his master's thesis, that chapter on Heidegger!
Well, really.
Let's say just that when he continued his education elsewhere,
it was a mutual decision.
It was natural, perhaps, that from theology he should turn to
classical philology. As a student of modern languages, I have
always envied classicists their extensive set of ancillary tools,
their lexica, their dictionaries, their handbooks.
But to someone coming to classics from theology and Biblical
literature, of course, what seems most striking classics is the
striking poverty of the instrumentarium. Specialized glossaries
Page 147

Digital Humanities 2007
and grammars for individual authors, concordances, systematic
lists of all kinds were much less thick on the ground than one
might wish.

•

And so, characteristically, he set out to help fill this gap.
His first work in this vein is a series of books published
beginning in 1970 providing tables and data for the systematic
study of the Latin hexameter: first of all a volume of Metrische
Analysen zur Ars poetica des Horaz, which provides tables of
scansions, elision, ictus, and related information for each line
of Horace's poem, modeled on similar tables for metrical studies
provided by Eduard Norden in his edition of the Aeneid.
Similar volumes followed, over the years, for the twelve books
of Vergi's Aeneid, for the Georgica and the Bucolica, for
Lucretius, and so on.
In the Foreword to the volume on Book VI of the Aeneid, there
appears a sentence which seems to sum up, programmatically,
both the capabilities and the potential limits of digital
processing:
Electronic data processing can be put into service whenever
data of any kind — notably including texts — must be processed
according to rules which are unambiguously formulatable and
completely formalizable.
What more compact formulation could we find of the
fundamental program of our field? And what more matter of
fact reminder that this is a description of those places where
computers can successfully be deployed, without any suggestion
of belief that they can be deployed absolutely everywhere.
The metrical tools set an emphasis which has continued to
characterize all of Herr Ott's work throughout his career:
computers should serve scholarly purposes, not vice versa. In
his discussion of the tables and their preparation, three virtues
are seen as particularly important:
•
•
•

completeness
reliability
verifiability

All of these concerns characterize Herr Ott's later work as well.
There is, too, a concern for accessibility. Initially, it motivated
the publication of the metrical analyses in book form, to make
them accessible to classicists without compuational expertise
or means. Later, the concern for accessibility led to efforts to
make the software which generated those analyses accessible
to other scholars, to extend them to make a more tool useful
for other kinds of analysis as well. In due course, these efforts
produced a suite of programs for scholarly work with text,
which at some point acquired the name Tustep, the Tübingen
System of Text Processing tools.
Tustep embodied a number of important ideas:
Page 148

•

completeness: It can be used for all parts of a project's
normal work. There is an editor for data capture and
revision, there are copy commands and tape utilities for
archiving and moving data, there are a variety of general
and specialized proceessing tools for manipulating
documents, for sorting things, for extracting relevant items
from lists, for laying documents out on the page, for
photocomposition of the resulting pages, and so on.)
verifiability: Every action undertaken with Tustep will be
logged, unless you take very active steps to avoid having it
logged.
stability: Since projects may live for years or decades, the
stability of the program and of Tustep files is critically
important.
consistency: Years before anyone outside of Bell Labs had
heard of Unix, Tustep adopted the principle that every tool
would have one primary input and one primary output, and
that the output of every tool would be usable as the input
to any other tool. In practice, this means that the primary
input and the primary output of each tool use the Tustep
file format.

This principle of ensuring that other Tustep programs can read
the primary output of any Tustep program is consistently
implemented, even in cases where one might have expected a
different choice. When I learned that the typesetting program
of Tustep also produces a Tustep file as its output — the PDF
or photocomposer file is, formally speaking, a side effect — I
admired the consistent application of the design principle but
privately thought that it bordered on the academic. Since for
practical purposes the main output of a typesetting program is
typeset pages, producing a Tustep file seems likely to be an
anticlimax. What useful output can it produce? Perhaps just a
copy of its input?
The most important idea of Tustep, though, is that it is the
responsibility of the software to serve the needs of scholarship,
and not vice versa, and that the responsibility of the scholar is
to respect the significant particularities of the material and the
demands of his discipline (not any standards of practice imposed
from outside, and least of all any limitations imposed by the
software.)
Tustep developed over thirty years of listening to the needs of
scholarship, consulting with projects and adding to Tustep the
functionality they needed to enable them to do their work.
Hundreds of editions have been prepared with it, some all the
way from beginning to end, from data capture through typeset
pages, others just translated into Tustep for the typesetting —
apparatus criticus is not easy to set!
If we are to take responsibility, as humanists, for our use of
machines, then it is necessarily now a part of humanities
scholarship to understand and develop ways to make machines

Digital Humanities 2007
adapt to the requirements of our work, and (while remaining
open to the exploitation of new and unforeseen opportunities)
to resist the temptation to adjust our practices to suit the
convenience of the machine. In this sense, Wilhelm Ott's
decades of work on Tustep have been not only the work of a
software developer, but more profoundly the work of a gifted
humanist.
It has been the great good fortune of our field to benefit from
Wilhelm Ott's work as a scholar. His work has taught a great
deal over the years to those wise enough to learn from it. And
I for one am grateful for the chance, this evening, to learn from
him in person.

Bringing the Digital Revolution
to Judaic Music: The Judaica
Sound Archives (JSA)
Salwa Ismail Patel (spatel37@fau.edu)
Florida Atlantic University

T

he Judaica Sound Archives at Florida Atlantic University
(FAU) has been in existence since 1990s with primary
funding from the FAU Libraries and some private funding from
donors. It was started as a grassroots effort by a Cantor to just
preserve and save some cantorial music and has now grown to
encompass all the arrays of Judaica music including as many
as 70,000 recordings. JSA’s aims and objectives have evolved
from the initial goal of establishing a preservation-quality digital
archive for at-risk sources of Judaic music to a full online
delivery system for sound, images and metadata with tools for
scholarly research and annotation. However, what has not
wavered or changed is the total commitment to the highest
quality and resolution for sound and images, excellent work
practices and rigorous quality control and constant evolution
and adaptation to new evolving technologies for audio and
textual digitization.
This abstract describes the JSA project from its inception to its
current phase, showcasing the innovative work that is being
done to develop this project, using computer technology to
overcome certain challenges and the usage of computing in a
unique method to make this collection more accessible to a
wider range of scholars and students.
JSA came about as a result of a fortuitous collision between of
a corpus of music recordings being donated to the FAU
Libraries and the rapid advances in digital technologies at FAU
Libraries making music accessibility to the academic users a
possibility. All these recordings are primary sources that revolve
around the life related to Jewish and Yiddish/Hebrew speaking
cultures in the United States in the early and mid-years of the
20th century. The principal work of this project falls into two
broad categories: digitizing rare at-risk recordings and making
these available digitally to the scholars, researchers and students
interested in computing humanities sound recordings. Beginning
with less than a thousand 78 rpm recordings, JSA’s holdings
have expanded to include LP albums, cassette tapes and 45 rpm
records. Taken together, this represents well over 70,000 sound
tracks. The collection is continually growing as a result of
material donations from institutions and individuals. The 78
rpm sound recordings received at JSA are identified by song,
Page 149

Digital Humanities 2007
performer, and composer and entered into a database which is
searchable on this website. At present the collection holds 3,450
different titles on 78 rpm records, representing almost 7,000
different sound tracks produced between 1901 and the
mid-1950s. And JSA’s current short term goal is to digitize the
best example of every recording in the collection. The original
phonograph records or tapes are saved, shelved and protected
from further damage. One digitized copy is filtered and
enhanced electronically to improve the quality of the sound.
Another is kept in its original form.
According to, Samuel Brylawski, head of Recorded Sound
Section at the Library of Congress,” Digital media have the
advantage of not suffering any loss of information as they are
copied, unlike the generational losses inherent in the duplication
of analog media such as discs and cassette tape. The future of
audio preservation is reformatting audio tapes and discs to
computer files and systematically managing those files.”
University of California reported the first digital audio project
in the 1980s. Since then there has been a steady increase in
digital audio preservation projects. In a survey conducted by
Richard Griscom, about 42 libraries in the US responded to
having some kind of digital audio project available. However,
JSA is the only project in the nation that works on not only
preserving, but also digitizing and making accessible online
and on-site the rare Judaic recordings. Other important work
in the field of audio digitization is being done by Cornell
University, Indiana University and University of California,
Berkeley. However, Indiana University is the only library
system that is dealing with audio that is music much like JSA.
The difference in their approach is that it is not specific to a
certain culture or region and they are more focused on music
images and sheet music scores unlike the JSA focus on making
music files accessible and available. The music is searchable
using a database that implements the Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex
encoding. The music is then streamed onto the listeners’
computer.
This poster discussion will also include the various steps
involved in digitizing audio. We will discuss the Analog Format
Inspection, Playback Equipment Calibration, Analog to Digital
Conversion, Digital Editing System, and Accessibility and
Distribution. For the digital media, the goal is to make the
collection as generic as possible, thereby maximizing
accessibility and setting the stage for easy migration to the next
generation of digital storage.
In conclusion, this poster will provides a detailed overview of
the critical steps relevant to the digitization process of these
analog primary resource materials and making this music
available and searchable online.

The Encoding of Time in
Manuscripts Transcription:
Toward Genetic Digital Editions
Elena Pierazzo (elena.pierazzo@kcl.ac.uk)
King's College London

W

riting is a process that occurs in time. This simple and
obvious consideration involves many issues both from
a theoretical and practical point of view. A critical evaluation
of timing is really crucial in the case of modern authors'
autograph draft manuscripts because different layers of
corrections, deletions and additions can give insight into an
author’s way of working, key to the interpretations of his/her
works and the evolution of the author’s Weltanschaung, as
highlighted in genetic criticism over the last few years.1
Medieval manuscripts copied by one ore more scribes are also,
of course, the result of a process that occurred in time, but the
different kind of authorship involved in such cases seems to
involve a difference in the evaluation of the cultural weight of
recorded variants.
When a scholar inspects a written text, especially a manuscript,
s/he has in his/her hands the final result of that process and can
choose whether to approach it from a
codicological/documentary point of view, “photographing” the
resulting product, or from a genetic point of view, trying to
describe the teleological flow of authoring. The first approach
is more typical of scribes’ copies, the latter of autographic
(draft) manuscripts.
Practically, time based editions are really difficult to represent
in printed works, because of the bi-dimensionality of paper
sheets.
On voudrait représenter dans la bidimensionalité des pages un
processus génétique dont on s’est pourtant appliqué à montrer
que sa proprieté est d’ajouter à l’écrit, qui est bidimensionel,
une troisième dimension, qui est celle du temps!
(Gresillon 1994:121)

In a digital framework bi-dimensionality can be overruled by
a hypertextual/multimedia approach that can allow the creation
of a more flexible context for the presentation of a genetic
edition. The problem of a time based encoding has been
discussed in several circumstances (i.e. TEI Manuscripts SIG
Meeting Report 01, Vanhoutte 2002 that suggests the usage of
the markup solution employed in the transcription of speech
for the purpose), but – up till now – a coherent encoding model

Digital Humanities 2007
for such editions has not been proposed. And for a good reasons:
while it is possible to describe a relative-timed process, it is
very complicated, if not impossible, to draw a general
absolute-timed framework.

Analysis and time-based encoding of
authorial interventions

L

et us consider a couple of examples taken from page 3595
of Zibaldone of Giacomo Leopardi.

Fig. 1

In this line we can detect two corrections: 1) deletion of the
line under “si” and 2) deletion of “dotti” corrected into “denti”.
We can try to draw the timing of the creation of the segment
as follow:
Time 1: writing “che e’ si rechi a dotti”
Time 2: deletion of “dotti”; consequent writing of “denti”
Time 3: underlying of “si”
Time 4: deletion of the line under “si”
Time 5: underlying of “rechi” and “denti”
Time 6: writing of “l’un d’essi cibi”
Other timetables are also possible, but let’s assume this is the
more probable one. The text can be encoded using a TEI-based
mark-up with the help of a new global attribute (@time),
intending that it’s just an example to help the conceptualization
of the problem:
<seg time="1">che e' <del
type="underline deletion" time="4">
<hi rend="underline" time="3">si</hi>
> </del>
<hi rend="underline" time="5">rechi a'</hi>
<del type="overstrike" time="2">dotti</del>
</seg>
> <seg time="2">
<hi rend="underline" time="5">denti</hi>
</seg>
<seg time="6">l'un d'essi cibi</seg>
Such transcription tries to model the real flow of writing, but
such a model may not be workable. In fact, it will fragment the
flow of the plain writing in potentially infinite pieces. To
simplify it, we can assume as Time 0 (default) the time of the
normal plain writing flow, timing just editorial interventions.
The schedule will then be modified as follows:

Time 1: deletion of : “dotti”
Time 0: writing of “denti”
Time 2: underlying of “si”
Time 3: deletion of the underline under “si”
Time 4: underlying of “rechi” and “denti”
Time 0: writing of “l’un d’essi cibi”
A further simplification is also possible: assuming that – in
genetic criticism terms – so-called “writing variant” (deletion
of a single word substituted by another that immediately follows
on the same line) occurs during the normal writing flow, the
following model can be drawn:
Time 0: writing “che si rechi a dotti”; deletion of : “dotti”;
writing of “denti”; writing of “l’un d’essi cibi”
Time 1: underlying of “si”
Time 2: deletion of the underline under “si”
Time 3: underlying of “rechi” and “denti”
This will be the consequent new encoding: che e' <del
type="underline deletion" time="2"> <hi
rend="underline"
time="1">si</hi></del>
<hi rend="underline" time="3">rechi a'</hi>
<del
type="overstrike">dotti</del>
<hi
rend="underline" time="3">denti</hi> l'un
d'essi cibi
The last possibility should not imply that any inline correction
is to be considered as done in Time 0, but just the one followed
by the correction. In fact, in the case of a deletion of an adjective
or of any other word not essential from a syntactical point of
view, the correction can occur in any time.

Fig. 2

This passage can be timed as follow:
Time 1: writing “che di due Eroi a”;
Time 2: deletion of “a”;
Time 3: writing of “quanto si voglia pari di”
Time 4: interlinear addition of “o più” after “Eroi”
Time 5: deletion of the addition
Time 6: interlinear addition of “o più” after “due”
Or, in the simplified version, as follow:
Time 0: writing of “che di due Eroi a”; deletion of “a”;
writing of “quanto si voglia pari di”
Time 1: interlinear addition of “o più” after “Eroi”
Time 2: deletion of the addition
Time 3: interlinear addition of “o più” after “due”

Time 0: writing “che e’ si rechi a dotti”

Relative or absolute?

T

he two above examples occur on the same page: shall we
then consider Time 1 of the first example the same of
Time 1 of the second example? The answer should be: no; very
little can be said about the timing of editorial/authorial
intervention in two different segments. The possibility of
establishing an absolute timing for correction is applicable only
where we have strong palaeographic evidences or authorial
declarations dating or describing a revision.
For instance, we can imagine an author used to typewrite his/her
texts and then to correct them by hand: in this case the
assumption of an absolute time is possible. But as different
layers of hand corrections can also occur, there will be, in this
case also, the necessity of considering relative-timed
interventions. This situation can be represented in encoding
distinguishing absolute and relative timing for instance by the
application of two different attributes, i.e. @timeRel and
@timeAbs In a digital framework an incorrect consideration
of time as absolute or relative can bring to display texts that
never existed. Let us imagine for a moment that we build an
XSLT based tool able to display at a time either Time 1, Time
2 or Time 3 etc. variants: the results would be the display of
variants that might have lived in different moments.
I think that, in absence of explicit authorial declarations or of
palaeographic evidence, the only possible display would be to
show timing of variants segment by segment, i.e. to give
evidence just of relative timed corrections.
In the presentation I will present some examples from different
authors (Giacomo Leopardi, Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf and
some others) to examine the complexity of representation of
temporal factors in digital genetic editions.

Theories of the sign

T

his consideration begins in the theories of signification
proposed in Structuralism, particularly as elucidated by
Ferdinand de Saussure and interpreted by Roland Barthes
(drawing on Hjelmslev and others). It will further be informed
by the general theory of “autopoiesis” as articulated by
Maturana and Varela (1987) and by other recent studies of
language and signification influenced by systems theory.
Of particular importance to this treatment are the following
Structuralist principles:
•

•

•

•

Composite nature of the sign - a sign is an event or a relation
between two components, a signifying part (signifier,
expression, or token) and a signified part (the content or
meaning of the sign).
Arbitrary nature of the sign - the relation between signifier
and signified in a sign is arbitrary, not inevitable or given
by nature. Thus slippage is possible in principle and, in
some systems, is common. This potential for slippage is
what accounts for much of the flexibility, adaptability and
power of sign systems.
Signs work in combination: individual words, for example,
have their significations, but when words are combined into
sentences they become more useful and more expressive.
Complete signs (considered as signifier/signified pairs) can
also enter into signifying relations. For example, a
metalanguage is a system of signs that describes another
system of signs; expressions in the metalanguage represent
signs in the signified sign system. Metalanguages provide
channels of regulation and feedback that are conducive to
the development of the sign systems they describe, and
eventually (when formalized sufficiently) enable automated
processes to manipulate signs systematically. Conversely,
a connotative system is a system of signs in which the
signifying parts of signs are themselves signs (one might
think of literary texts). Connotative systems demonstrate
the reciprocal relations between layers in a sign system and
Page 153

Digital Humanities 2007
the way significations at higher levels can condition and
affect signification at lower levels, even apart from the
application of metalanguages. While metalanguages abstract
and formalize the sign systems they describe, connotative
systems work by deploying signs as they are used concretely
in other contexts, bringing alternative significations into
play. Likewise, while metalanguages systematize and
formalize, and thus indicate where automated rules-based
processing is possible, connotative systems draw on and
reflect particular significations available only in specific
local contexts, and indicate where automation by traditional
means is difficult or impossible.

Figure 1: In both natural and artificial systems, a combination of simplicity
of design with complexity, versatility and adaptability of application is achieved
through a layered structure in which components with distinctive functions are
made by combining simpler components.

The Semantics of Layers and the
Layering of Semantics

A

very useful distinction can be made between two different
modes of signification, which we can call operational
and representational semantics. The representational semantics
of a sign corresponds to the conventional notion of what a sign
is and how it functions, that a sign “stands for” something,
reflecting and naming an actually existent “thing” in a real or
imagined world. In contrast, the operational semantics describes
not what the sign refers to in a purported world (which may or
may not be present to the senses), but rather simply how it
operates within the signifying system — which generally
includes the world, or at least the present and active
circumstances of the sign's use. (This in itself is the major
difference between “human” and “machine” semantics [Piez
2002].) The rules of combination that allow any given set of
signs to be assembled into a higher-order organization, which
itself has signifying potential, are part of their operational
Page 154

semantics; but so also are any disambiguating “incidentals”.
At all layers, operational semantics may be conditioned or
constrained by their context of operation: the “meaning” of a
sign is not built into the sign, but is established ad hoc, by
means of those distinctions between it and possible alternatives
that result in particular outcomes in application.
Interestingly, careful consideration suggests that while we often
consider that the representational aspect of a sign is fundamental
to its operation and provides part of its operational semantics,
in general the opposite is the case: operational semantics are
primary, and representational semantics can only be established
once operational semantics are set and perhaps codified. Once
a sign's operation has been established repeatedly it can start
to “carry its context with it” — that is, its context can begin to
include prior contexts, implicitly recognized — and this is the
beginning of representation. (A compelling description of this
process in human language development as well as in the more
rudimentary linguistic capabilities of chimpanzees, bonobos
and gorillas, may be read in [Greenspan and Shankar 2004].)
Thus, what any given sign represents must be inferred from its
context of operation — which may include the traces of other
occasions of its use — and much energy is given, in the
application of sign systems to doing useful work in the world,
to negotiating these inferences.
The construction of layered sign systems, in which complex
representations may be reliably constructed by a rules-based
assembly from simpler components, has the precise advantage
of managing and reducing this expenditure of energy.
Metalanguages (such as an orthography, formal logic, or the
grammars of natural or artificial languages), which describe
sign systems themselves and stipulate rules for their operation,
are more than sterile intellectual exercises. By abstracting and
codifying the application of rules to signs, they reduce the need
to rely on sheer brute force methods (memorization or
negotiation) to support the assembly of signs into sign systems,
thus reducing overall complexity and enabling more
sophisticated operations at higher levels.
Accordingly, media can be built out of building blocks
constituted of other media. Within a (relatively highly evolved)
language, utterances take the form of sentences or statements,
composed out of words; words are composed of phonemes (or
of letters, in the case of written words). When sentences or
statements or propositions are combined, they constitute yet
another medium at a higher level, which might be identified
with argument or narrative. Thus, media are built in layers,
each layer a hierarchy of subsystems on a lower layer. This is
characteristic of complex systems generally in both the natural
and artificial worlds (see [Simon 1996]).
In general, this layering is characterized by two related
phenomena:

Digital Humanities 2007
•

•

The distinctions between the layers becomes clearer over
time: media formats evolve and become more systematic
and coherent in composition. More and more complex and
comprehensive structures become progressively easier to
realize, at the cost of a certain kind of expressive power
characteristic of early or individual experiments. The higher
layers, as they solidify and consolidate, induce a process of
simplification and rationalization at lower layers.
Likewise, as you go up the stack, the distinction between
layers becomes less clear. The difference between a letter
and a word is almost always clear, but the distinction
between a statement and an argument is less so.

As media ascend in complexity, each layer is capable of more
“meaningfulness” than the layer it is built on; or at least it has
greater representational power, due to the consolidation of
operational and (on that basis) even of representational
semantics at lower layers. In turn, the context provided by the
combination of any set of tokens at any layer provides
information relevant to the construing of the local meaning of
each of the constituent tokens. This interpenetrating influence
between layers, familiar to all students of language and
literature, is an important feature of the entire system.
The most complex and “highest” of these layers currently might
go by the name of information architectures. Until recently we
have not really needed to have a name for this layer or members
of it (signs that appear in it), as they have for the most part been
identified with print media: we have spoken of indexes,
cross-references, tables of contexts, abstracts, summaries and
bibliographies without being aware that these things might not
have to be printed on paper. This is because traditionally, in
order to stabilize complex bodies of information, particular
features of print media have been indispensible — temporal
persistence and asynchrony; “random” or holistic access;
conventions of citation; graphic and typographic queues
representing organization and providing for navigability;
economies of scale afforded by mass production; and so on.
Now these features are available in the formats provided by
digital media — along with elaborations of them such as the
hyperlink, dynamic display and device independence — it
becomes useful to consider this higher layer without identifying
it with print technology.

Figure 2: Various different forms of communications media are formed by
layering.

Figure 3: At lower layers, alignments between constituent parts are generally
possible, leading to representational correspondences not only between media
and the world, but across media themselves. At higher layers, media find their
own particular strengths, constituting 'worlds of their own' whose
representational capabilities are both presumably greater, and more
problematic.

The Emergence of the Digital

L

ike all media (cf. Marshall McLuhan), digital formats
begin as representations (operational refigurations) of
prior media. But just as alphabetic literacy, following the logic
of its own peculiar operational semantics, quickly assumes
forms distinct from the oral forms it begins by mediating, digital
media soon become something other than the print counterparts
that were to be “transmitted” by telecommunications
technologies. Again, it achieves these forms by layering.
Despite the highly developed form of the processing stack when
it comes to the computer's own processing (its operations),
however, when it comes to digital media we are still at a point
Page 155

Digital Humanities 2007
when these layers are inchoate — although the standardization
efforts of the last decade (especially as regards HTML, CSS,
XML and XSLT) are providing a level of metalinguistic control
conducive to their development and maturation. Yet for the
most part, applications of digital media are still either derivative
of other forms (in the sense that a page on the web may be
almost entirely analogous to the same document in print) or
directly in service to them; digital media have not fully come
into their own.
Nonetheless, the usefulness and power of layering in this
context too has long been recognized: we only need to recall
the familiar dogma (and the discussion that has surrounded it)
of the “separation of format from content” in the design and
deployment of markup-based publication systems (see
[Sperberg- McQueen and Burnard, 1994], [Durand et al. 1996],
[Piez 2001], [Sperberg-McQueen et al. 2002], [Piez 2002]).
This tradition recognizes that so-called “descriptive encoding”
works by anticipating and expressing at a lower layer (in what
we call source code), the rationale for structures to be expressed
at higher layers through site organization, page layout,
typography, screen widgetry, linking and all the apparatus of
a full-blown architecture. In this respect, the tagging of an XML
document whose encoding is descriptive and data-oriented
rather than prescriptive and application-oriented proves to be
a connotative system, as the signifiers (the element names “title”
and “p”) that describe the data (this chunk of text is a nominal
paragraph; that one a title) are themselves signs, to be
transformed by a heuristic and rules-based process into
renditions that will themselves signify to readers that they are
paragraphs or titles. This anticipation or prolepsis by markup
of further signification elucidates the confusion as to whether
we consider descriptive encoding to be at a “higher” or “lower”
layer, as indeed it is paradoxically both. Within a classical
three-tiered architecture, the XML encoding is “below” its
HTML (or print, or SVG, or ODF) rendition; yet we also
describe the conversion from descriptive XML into a
presentational format such as HTML as a “down-conversion”
(since it “loses information”), by rendering only indirectly in
presentational features, if at all, what is explicit in the source.
The reason we can, in effect, go down to go up, is that here the
lower layer achieves its aim of scalability and reusability by
working to describe a higher layer that it is not yet practical (if
it ever will be) for the computer to infer on its own: it provides,
in representational form by a kind of "sleight of hand" (the
operational semantics being invisible to the machine and left
to the stylesheet designer), information that would ordinarily
be available only by a processing context not yet available —
the act of reading itself. In fact, the transformation from
descriptive XML to HTML is not actually taking it “up” the
ladder towards richer information design; it is merely
transposing the data into another stack altogether, where, since
the operational semantics of HTML are more tightly bound to
standard processing contexts (the browser), its implicit
Page 156

functionalities can be elaborated, while the representational
aspect can be deferred to where it makes more sense — where,
because the tagging now signifies “large and bold”, the reader
can be trusted to infer “title”.
Yet the same discussion has also masked deeper problems and
issues (see [Buzzetti 2002], [Caton 2005]) stemming from the
limitations in current markup systems, which can gracefully
handle only a single organizational hierarchy at a time, and thus
lack the representational and expressive power necessary to
take full advantage of the computer's capabilities for useful
automated processing of complex textual artifacts.
Nevertheless, understanding digital text encoding technologies
as complex sign systems elucidates how and why they function
without resorting to the metaphysical appeal that “good”
encoding should be designed to describe the “thing itself”.
Especially given the limitations inherent in XML's design, such
a position proves soon to be untenable; yet XML systems
succeed in doing useful work notwithstanding, and provide the
foundations for sustainable, scalable and navigable information
resources, whose presentational features (interfaces) can be
improved over time. This in itself represents a major advance
over what was ever possible in the past.
More generally, a consideration of digital text encoding as a
distinctive semiotic system, with its own metalanguages and
its own relation to media artifacts, suggests why the humanistic
study of digital media remains so foreign to traditional
disciplines in the humanities. Likewise, it points the way to the
future, as it becomes clear what, and how much, still remains
to be done.

Figure 4: While metalanguages can be expensive to maintain, they provide
means not only to describe but also to maintain and control the communications
media they describe.

Phonemic Accumulations and the
Analysis of Poetry
Marc Plamondon (mplamond@chass.utoronto.ca)
Nipissing University

I

shall present my latest work on the theory of phonemic
accumulations and its application to the study of poetry.
Computerized stylistics tends to concentrate on words: word
frequencies, word co-occurrences, word collocations, and word
distributions. My computer-assisted study of stylistics
concentrates on the phonemic content of the texts. Computerized
phonemic analysis is beginning to yield interesting insights into
written texts, especially those, such as poetry, for which sound
patterning constitutes a significant element. In A Companion
to Digital Humanities (2004), Ian Lancashire mentions sound
as a future source of inquiry in textual stylistics: “As the
implications of cognitive research become understood,
text-analysis systems may change, and with them stylistics.
Texts in languages whose spelling departs widely from its
sounding will likely be routinely translated into a phonological
alphabet, before processing, as researchers recognize the
primacy of the auditory in mental language processing”
(“Cognitive Stylistics and the Literary Imagination”). I have
begun undertaking this work with a computer application that
translates poems into their broad phonetic transcriptions. The
program can then provide visualizations of the phonemic
content of the poems, and it can perform calculations on the
content.
The theory of phonemic accumulations is based on the theory
of the persistence of vision: the effect of a phoneme when
reading is carried through to the following phonemes. At the
same time, its effect tapers off. When the same phoneme is
encountered while the effect of the first phoneme has not been
nullified, a cumulative effect of the two phonemes is produced.
This gives rise to important sound effects in poetry and literature
in general, the most obvious of which is alliteration. The
cumulative effect of the /s/ phonemes in “silver silent sails” far
exceeds the effect of the individual /s/ phonemes if the words
occurred at a greater distance from each other. My computer
program is able to quantify the impression the /s/ phonemes
may have on the reader of these words.
While many different possibilities present themselves for
analysis, my current work focusses on calculations of the
fricative accumulations and the plosive accumulations of a
poem. The fricative consonants are often regarded as soft
sounds, while the plosive consonants are often regarded as
Page 158

harsh sounds. I have already shown that the percentage of
plosives and fricatives in poems is mostly constant across poems
and authors. Consequently, the occurrence of these phonemes
on their own do not produce a significant effect; it is the
groupings or occurrences in proximity with each other that
seem to produce effects upon the reader. Graphs of their
phonemic accumulations exhibit distinct peaks and troughs,
and the differences between the two accumulations reveal
interesting insights.
For example, Robert Browning’s “Two in the Campagna” has
a very intense climax of the difference of the fricative and
plosive accumulations in its fifth, sixth, and seventh stanzas.
These stanzas are those that are most expressive of true love
and passion: while the whole poem is an expression of love,
more negative thoughts such as the fleetingness of life and the
inability to achieve true love on earth are intermingled with the
attempts to seduce. The three stanzas with the fricative
accumulation climax, however, are the most rhapsodic, the least
tainted with doubt. Similarly, in Browning’s “Porphyria’s
Lover,” a poem about the murdering of a woman whom the
speaker loves too intensely, the stanza (or five-line set—the
poem is not officially divided into stanzas) with the greatest
climax of the difference of the fricative and plosive
accumulations is the fifth, where the speaker of the poem tells
how Porphyria expresses her love for him. The rest of the poem
is predominantly heavier on the plosive accumulation side. The
pattern that emerges is that when the difference between the
fricative and plosive accumulations favours the fricatives, the
sentiment of the poem is more positive, loving, and sincere.
When the plosives are favoured, the sentiment of the poem is
more insincere, withdrawn, and bleak. I shall present my results
for these and other poems of a similar structure. These are early
results, but the results are very promising.
This work is important for the study of literature. This is the
first time (that I am aware of) that the phonemic content of a
text, i.e. its sound on the page, is put to such advanced
calculations. Literary analyses often have to rely upon
impressionistic language when discussing the effect of the
sounds of the words upon the reader: phrases such as, “the
prevalence of s sounds in the final stanza leaves the reader with
a soothing, peaceful feeling, one that has countered the chaos
of the opening stanzas.” Through the analysis of phonemic
content such as I am performing, I can provide critics with
quantifiable data upon which to base their claims. Further, the
possibility that phonemic accumulations are related to the ideas
expressed in the poems suggests strongly that a computer can
begin to interpret poetry: that it can distinguish passages with
expressions of intense, sincere love from passages with
expressions of self-doubt or insincerity. Phonemic analysis may
produce significant developments in the field of artificial
intelligence.

Examples of Images in Text
Editing
Dorothy Carr Porter (dporter@uky.edu)
University of Kentucky

I

n 2002, Computers and the Humanities dedicated an issue
to “Image-based Humanities Computing” at a time when
“a majority of first generation image-based humanities
computing projects have reached at least an initial plateau of
completion.” (Kirschenbaum, p. 3) Since that time interest in
incorporating primary source images into “text” editions has
blossomed, as can be attested by recent threads on the TEI
listserv and work on the TEI council to develop
recommendations for specific methods for integrating image
files – and pointers to areas of image files – into traditional text
encoding projects. The number of image-based projects has
multiplied in that time as well, although it takes some effort to
find who is working on such projects. There is not (yet) a central
listing of all image-based TEI projects under development.
Practical work has been done on tool development since 2002
as well. As of March 1, 2007 there are no less than six tools of
which I am aware that serve to edit or display images within
the context of text editing. The majority of these tools are for
linking text and image for digital display.1 Add to these
additional tools for the simple annotation of images2 and tools
for tagging multimedia.3 Undoubtedly, the proliferation of tools
focused on image editing and display reflects a growing interest
in incorporating images into digital editions.
The number of tools available for working with text plus image
in digital editing highlights a simple truth: projects and their
sources are different, and technologies that will work for one
project might be incompatible with another. On the other hand,
technologies applicable in simple circumstances might be
expanded and combined with other technologies to suit much
more complex situations. In this presentation, I will describe
the sources of two digital projects with reference to their
requirements for becoming viable digital projects. One is quite
simple and the other complex, but the same methods inform
both projects.

Edmunds in the late eleventh or early twelfth century by a scribe
– or perhaps two scribes – who used the round English Caroline
minuscule common there rather than the more pointed Norman
Caroline minuscule that came to prominence in England in the
period immediately following the Norman Conquest. Following
the disillusionment of Bury St. Edmunds in 1538, Pembroke
25 disappeared for a time, but it was given to Pembroke College,
Cambridge, at the end of the sixteenth century, and it still lives
in that library today. It has been well maintained, it is not
damaged, and the script is clear and easy to decipher.
For an edition of this sort, a single text from a single manuscript,
the encoding requirements are relatively simple. This
manuscript is purely textual, not illustrated or illuminated in
any way, but we are noting all abbreviations and distinctive
paleographical aspects in the manuscript (including scribal
emendations), as well as marginalia. The TEI Header contains
some descriptive information, notably a descriptive list of all
abbreviation types that are linked to the individual abbreviations
throughout the project. We are using the EPPT for the
text-image linking in this project, and I will give a brief
demonstration of the project as it stands at the time of the
conference.
The Electronic Aelfric , directed by Aaron Kleist at Biola
University and developed by a large group of collaborators,
seeks to edit eight Old English homilies by Ælfric of Eynsham,
who was arguably the most educated and prolific writer of tenth
century England. These homilies cover the period from Easter
to Pentecost, and trace their development through six phases
of authorial revision and then through nearly 200 years of
transmission following Ælfric’s death: twenty-four sets of
readings or strands of textual tradition found in twenty-eight
manuscripts produced in at least five scriptoria between 990
and 1200.
The contrast between the Electronic Aelfric and Pembroke 25
is great: while Pembroke 25 is one manuscript, the Electronic
Aelfric draws from twenty-eight manuscripts. Although no
single homily out of the eight occurs in more than ten of these
manuscripts, it is still a great number of textual variants to deal
with. In addition to the text, the project also needs to address
the individual manuscripts – six of which are from the infamous
Cotton Collection (now housed in the British Library), damaged
by fire in 1731. Those manuscripts that are not damaged still
have singularities, such as marginalia, that we also wish to
encode and link to image. We are using the EPPT for this
project, partnered with the TEI Apparatus tags, to bring together
the text and images of several different manuscripts. I will show
examples of corresponding manuscript pages, as well as sample
code illustrating multiple variants partnered with image-text
linking.

T

he session "Digital Text Resources for the Humanities –
Legal Issues" consists of three papers that address the
legal aspects connected to several crucial phases of handling
text resources: collecting, compiling, curating, analysing,
distributing, and archiving text resources such as corpora, are
tasks carried out on a day-to-day basis by people involved in
fields such as, for example, humanities computing,
computational and corpus linguistics, information retrieval and
text mining. Despite the ubiquity of document collections, the
legal issues that are intrinsically tied to virtually all texts created
and published by third parties (most importantly, their
copyright, as well as privacy issues), do not typically attract a
lot of interest. Though these issues are acknowledged, they are
often regarded as rather insignificant for the research question
at hand, or a project does not have any jurisprudential expertise
to deal with legal issues in an adequate way. As a consequence,
distributing a corpus (for example, to other interested
Page 161

Digital Humanities 2007
researchers) whose provenance is unknown or questionable, or
publishing excerpts from a document collection on a website,
may become next to impossible from a legal point of view. This
is why scholars often decide not to publish their collections (or
parts thereof) online at all, in order to avoid any potential legal
problems. The session aims to provide an overview of the
following legal aspects:
•

•

•

The first contribution, "Language Corpora – Copyright –
Data Protection: The Legal Point of View" (Timm
Lehmberg, and Felix Zimmermann), highlights the legal
requirements that hold with regard to the construction of
digital text resources, special emphasis is given to the aspect
of copyright and data protection (for example, potential
reasons for the need to anonymise text corpora).
The second presentation, "Collecting Legally Relevant
Metadata by Means of a Decision-Tree-Based Questionnaire
System" (Timm Lehmberg, Christian Chiarcos, Erhard
Hinrichs, Georg Rehm, and Andreas Witt), consists of two
parts: first, a web-based questionnaire is introduced that
was developed to capture the requirements research projects
have with regard to the archiving and distribution of their
corpora; second, initial results from a study that spans three
large research centres and more than 60 individual research
projects are reported.
The final paper, "Corpus Masking: Legally Bypassing
Licensing Restrictions for the Free Distribution of Text
Collections" (Georg Rehm, Andreas Witt, Heike
Zinsmeister, and Johannes Dellert), introduces the idea of
masking an annotated text corpus whose original source
text collection is copyright-protected, so that the masked
version can be distributed without any restrictions;
furthermore, a fully working tool for masking an
XML-annotated corpus is presented.

The authors of the three papers are associated with a joint
project situated in three Collaborative Research Centres (SFB,
Sonderforschungsbereich) that are sponsored by the German
Research
Foundation
(DFG,
Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft): SFB 441 (Linguistic Data Structures,
Tübingen University), SFB 538 (Multilingualism, Hamburg
University), and SFB 632 (Information Structure, Potsdam
University). Each of these three research centres consists of
about 15 to 20 research projects. Most projects work with digital
text collections, in practically all cases these collections and
corpora are constructed by the respective researchers
themselves. A problem people involved in the fields of digital
humanities or computational linguistics are often confronted
with concerns the fact that the sustainability and reusability of
corpora is not given too much attention – or that these aspects,
in a worst case scenario, are completely ignored. Corpora are
often created for an application or for a project that has a very
specific research question, but when the project is finished it
becomes next to impossible (especially for third parties) to gain
Page 162

access to the resource that took several months or maybe even
years to create. The joint project Sustainability of Linguistic
Data was therefore established to provide the conceptual,
technical and infrastructural basis for a solution to the problem
of sustainably archiving these digital text collections, addressing
issues as diverse as, for example, annotation and metadata
frameworks, best practice guidelines, legal issues of distributing
text collections, and unifying diverse tag sets by means of an
ontology.

Language Corpora – Copyright – Data Protection:
The Legal Point of View
Felix Zimmermann and Timm Lehmberg
1 Introduction
Creating comprehensive and sustainable archives of linguistic
data and making them (or parts of them) accessible to the
research community leads to a number of essential legal
questions being raised by different aspects of law. Like any
discipline handling large amounts of data, the digital humanities
are confronted with a complex system of authorities and
restrictions. From acquisition, through storing and processing
to the annotation and finally publication of the data, there are
a number of rights as well as duties each participant in this
process has to consider. Additionally, some legal systems
provide special rules for the use of data for scientific purposes.
On the one hand the opacity of the legal position leads to the
assumption that, in many cases, linguistic data are used and
transferred in a way that does not comply with legal
requirements. On the other hand there is a noticeable tendency
not to transfer linguistic data for fear of breaking the law (see
Jüttner 2000, and Patzelt 2003).

2 Relevant Areas of Law
Two different areas of law play an important role in the use of
linguistic data for research purposes:
•

•

"Intellectual Property Rights" provide legal protection of
non-material goods which are any kind of intellectual
property of a third party. This includes, amongst others,
literary works as well as databases, software and utility
patents. In terms of law language corpora are defined as
databases.
"Privacy and Personal Data Protection Law" imposes
restrictions for the processing of any personal data, i.e., any
data that can be linked to an individual. In the face of
linguistic data processing any audio and video recordings

Digital Humanities 2007
(and their transcriptions) as well as metadata that contain
personal information on speakers are covered by this law.
Both areas are relevant to the complete process of data
processing and have to be considered from the initial step of
the data based work (normally the acquisition of the data) to
the time of publication.

3 Aspects of National and International Law
In everyday legal practice a particularly relevant role is played
by those legislative rulesets that are based on constitutional
norms. Within these, interests and entitlements of other involved
individuals and institutions, which are worthy of protection,
are often outlined in minute detail in relation to the procurement,
processing, and transfer of linguistic primary data.
Federal states, which contain individual member states with
their own legislative authority (such as the US, Germany,
Switzerland, Austria, Spain) may have enacted specific member
state rules. This leads to the possibility that there may be
complex and potentially internally conflicting legislation within
a state in a federation.
It is not just, however, the original national legal situation which
regulates the use of linguistic data. International obligations
may, through direct or indirect applicability, have considerable
impact. In 2007, 27 member states of the European Union
adhere to European legal instruments (such as directives and
regulations) in relation to the national and international use of
data. Pursuant to the doctrine of direct applicability enshrined
in Article 10 of the Treaty establishing the European
Communities, these norms have priority in relation to potentially
conflicting national norms. What needs to be borne in mind is
that the individual member states have some leeway in the
implementation of the instruments, which may lead to minute
differences in the level of protection.
Finally, public international treaties which oblige their
signatories to adhere to certain minimal standards need to be
taken into consideration. In relation to linguistic data and the
problem of copyright, the Copyright Treaty of the World
Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO, 1996) is to be
considered as particularly relevant. The question of personality
rights with a view to individuals whose data are processed is
addressed in the Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental
Freedoms (1950). Additionally, the Convention for the
Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing
of Personal Data (1981) provides further normative guidance
for the member states of the European Union.

4 The Legal Impact of Intellectual Property
Copyright protection of language corpora is provided by
different aspects of applicable law. In order to simplify the

presentation, there will be a focus on the law of harmonised
rules by the European Communities that are placed within the
framework of the World Intellectual Property Organisation
(WIPO).
4.1 Directive 91/250/EC on the Legal Protection of Computer
Programs
The different tasks of linguistic data processing (transcription
as well as annotation etc.) require a considerable number of
software tools. For this purpose, apart from commercial
development, software is written by the research establishment's
employees. The participants in this process rarely bother with
legal protection of their work. By implementing the Directive
91/250/EC, computer programs in all Member States of the
European Community are protected by copyright law. In
accordance with Article 1.3 of the Directive 91/250/EC, a
computer program is protected, if it is original in the sense that
it is the author's own intellectual creation. Ideas and principles
of a computer program are not protected by this Directive. The
term of protection is the author's lifetime plus a period of 50
years. The author owns the exclusive rights to reproduce,
translate, adapt and publicly distribute his computer program.
If a computer program has been created by an employee, in
accordance with Article 2.3 of the Directive 91/250/EC, the
employer is, unless otherwise provided by contract, the
copyright holder of the resource. In the case of software being
developed within a research project, from this point of view
the copyright is held by the respective research establishment
(University etc.).
4.2 Directive 96/9/EC on the Legal Protection of Databases
In accordance with Article 1.2 of the Directive 96/9/EC, a
database is defined as a "collection of independent works, data
or other materials arranged in a systematic or methodical way
and individually accessible by electronic or other means".
Without exception, linguistic corpus data come under this
protection. This Directive makes two significant stipulations.
First, it offers protection by copyright to databases which, by
reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents,
constitute the author's own intellectual creation. Thereby the
author owns the exclusive right to carry out or authorise the
reproduction, alteration and distribution. Secondly the Directive
creates an exclusive right protection sui generis for makers of
databases, independent of the degree of innovation. This
protection of any investment allows the makers of databases
to prevent unauthorised extraction and/or re-utilisation.
4.3 Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC
The Copyright Directive 2001/29/EC adapts legislation on
copyright and related rights to reflect technological
developments into European Community law. In this process,
it discusses and harmonises the property of reproduction,
communication and distribution rights. Concerning linguistic
research data, attention should be paid to Article 5.3(a) of the
Page 163

Digital Humanities 2007
Copyright Directive. It gives freedom to Member States in
supporting non-commercial science by making copyright less
restrictive for academic use of copyrighted work.

5 The Legal Impact of Data Protection
Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard
to the processing of personal data imposes strict restrictions for
the elevation and utilisation of personal data. Personal data are
pieces of information which can be linked to a specific person.
The processing of personal data only is permitted by law, if
there is a clear and lawful purpose at the time of data
procurement, and if the respective person has expressed his/her
consent. Further restrictions are imposed, if the racial, national
or ethnical origin, political opinion, religious or philosophical
beliefs are apparent. The same applies to the disclosure of health
conditions or sexual life. If personal data are transferred to
countries outside of the European Union (Transborder Dataflow
to third countries), a level of protection has to be guaranteed
that is equivalent to the European level, for example by means
of the Safe-Harbour-Principles. The respective person may
enforce his/her rights by means such as disclosure and deletion
of the data. Article 6.2, Article 11.2 and Article 13.2 of the
Data Protection Directive contain privileges for academic
research. An escape strategy in respect of data protection law
problems is complete anonymisation (disguising by removing
personal information by abbreviating names, locations etc.) or
pseudonymisation (disguising by aliasing individuals, locations,
etc.) of the personal data. However, it remains unsolved which
level of abstraction constitutes sufficient anonymisation,
particularly if it is possible to draw conclusions by joining the
data with other resources.
Figure 1 gives an overview about the different types of right
holders to a database.

Legal Competence by Trusted Third Parties
An additional option is given by the use of a trusted third party
hosting the information that has been disguised by
anonymisation or pseudonymisation. It may act as a trustee,
passing the aliased or anonymised data from its origin to a
requesting research institution. The trusted party is not required
by law, but it has the ability to provide a high level of data
security, integrity and protection during the whole data
transaction process (Kilian et al 1995, p. 63). Additionally a
trusted party can provide specialist advice in technical and
copyright matters. Further, we suggest proceedings to increase
legal certainty in case of creating and using linguistic databases.

Collecting Legally Relevant Metadata by Means
of a Decision-Tree-Based Questionnaire System
Timm Lehmberg, Christian Chiarcos, Erhard
Hinrichs, Georg Rehm, and Andreas Witt
1 Introduction and Overall Concept
Most metadata standards used for corpus linguistic purposes
(TEI, OLAC, IMDI etc., for a complete overview see Lehmberg
and Wörner 2007) require elements that contain legal
information about the rights holder to the particular resource
and/or its accessibility. Normally these metadata elements are
kept very abstract and do neither distinguish between the
different types of personal rights nor do they consider the option
of multiple holders of copyright.

Figure 1: The different types of right holders

Page 164

The legal situation upon which the evaluation of linguistic data
to be used for scientific purposes is based is clearly defined,
but too complex to be understood completely by non-experts.
Furthermore, it varies from one country to the other and is in
a constant state of flux.

Digital Humanities 2007
In the framework of our joint sustainability initiative (see the
introduction to this session), a large number of heterogeneous
corpora have been acquired from multiple sources and multiple
projects, and processed with regard to different individual
requirements (Schmidt et al. 2006). This heterogeneity is
responsible for the problem that the legal metadata that need
to be collected strongly vary with regard to the respective corpus
and data situation. Only for a small number of projects
associated with our sustainability initiative are detailed sets of
legal metadata that inform a potential user of the corpus about,
for example, stipulations or copyright holders, readily available.
For the majority of projects and corpora, this task has to be
performed retroactively.

this map queries are represented as nodes whereas responses
are represented as links between them. The primary query given
in the centre node (see figure 1) corresponds to two central
aspects of law (data protection and copyright, see Zimmermann
and Lehmberg, in this session). Each response leads to a large
number of additional queries that again, depending on the users'
response, have subordinated queries. Further sections of the
concept map deal with the accessibility of the data as well as
their respective principles and standards of data processing.
In same manner we modelled the query structure that surveys
the meta information that ideally has been collected in
connection with the compilation process of corpora. Therefore
it contains queries asking for established metadata standards
(TEI, DC, OLAC, IMDI etc.) that may have been used, and if
necessary asks for additional information.
Due to the fact that the IHMC CmapTools provide an export
of concept maps into an XML-based format, the content and
structure of the concept map can be processed automatically to
create the web based questionnaire that is described in the
following section.
The complete concept map structures will be demonstrated in
conjunction with example scenarios in our presentation.

2 Implementation
Figure 1: A concept map visualising the query structure

Facing the complexity of the legal context (see Zimmermann
and Lehmberg, in this session), it is almost impossible for
non-experts to evaluate the situation of their language data and
to extract the relevant metadata without professional advice.
To reduce the complexity of this task, concept maps were
created with the goal of making the legal situation as well as
the legal terminology transparent and understandable to
non-professionals. Unlike mindmaps that are primarily used
for the (often spontaneous and intuitive) mapping of ideas and
processes, the technique of concept mapping is intended more
for knowledge modelling: concepts are represented by nodes,
links represent the relations between them.

As the questionnaire has to be accessible from different research
project locations, it has been implemented using a XAMP (any
operating system, Apache, MySQL and PHP) architecture to
create a user-friendly, web-based interface. The conceptual
structure represented by the concept map is transformed into a
relational database model. Accordingly, it is possible both to
model the tree structure of the queries (Celko, 2004) and to
save responses to these questions within the database.
Additionally, the database includes user data (as well as user
access control data) and links them to the metadata sets of the
resource being acquired by the questionnaire.

As a utility to create the concept maps modelling the legal
situation within our joint sustainability initiative we used
CmapTools, a program distributed by the Institute for Human
and Machine Cognition (IHMC). IHMC CmapTools provide
a client/server architecture that allows users at different
locations to work collectively on Concept Maps and to discuss
their structure and content online.
Based on these schemata and following the principles of
decision-trees, we built an additional concept map representing
the query structure of a questionnaire. Digressing from the
original principles of concept mapping mentioned above, in

The user interface is generated by a script that parses the
database and guides the user though the questionnaire tree with

the help of a web-based wizard (see figure 2). This architecture
has several advantages:

Subordinate queries that refer to specific details of some
legal aspects automatically can be skipped if they become
superfluous. For instance, there is no need to query
contractual agreements with subjects if there is no personal
data contained in the corpus.
The data model provides users with the option of registering
multiple corpora and running the questionnaire wizard
individually. Furthermore, users can share the data they
entered into the system with other registered users so that
it is possible to edit the data across project locations (for
example, queries can be skipped, answered later, or left to
other users).
Should the structure or content of the questionnaire tree be
changed, the database will be modified accordingly. If the
change leads to unanswered queries, this will be indicated
to the user in a status page. For this reason, every user
account has an overview page that gives information about
the state of progress of every registered resource (see figure
3).
The questionnaire includes queries about metadata content
and standards that already have been applied to the
registered corpora, so that users do not have to insert
redundant information already contained in existing
metadata sets.
Administrator users have unlimited access to all data in the
database, so that users can be provided with support, if
needed.

We are currently in the process of collecting legally relevant
metadata from about 60 different research projects with the aid
of the questionnaire system described in this paper. Content
and structure of the concept maps is available on our project
homepage at <http://www.sfb441.uni-tuebingen

Corpus Masking: Legally Bypassing Licensing
Restrictions for the Free Distribution of Text
Collections
Georg Rehm, Andreas Witt, Heike Zinsmeister,
and Johannes Dellert
1 Introduction
Though XML-annotated text collections are commonplace in
humanities computing, the value of the annotation is often
underestimated, as interesting applications can be realised by
ignoring the content and considering the annotation exclusively.
At the same time, the distribution of text collections (e. g.,
linguistic resources) is often restricted by rigid licence
agreements. Usually, a corpus consists of a source text
collection (STC) acquired from third parties such as web sites
or publishers, and annotation layers that refer to, for example,
structural or linguistic properties. In practically all cases the
STC is a copyrighted property, so that it is up to the copyright
holder to decide if, and under which conditions, the corpus - a
crucial part of which is the STC - can be made available to the
public or to the research community.
The example we use in this paper is TüBa-D/Z ("Tübingen
Treebank of Written German" (Telljohann et al, 2004 &
Telljohann et al, 2006)). This manually annotated treebank is
based on a CD ROM that contains an archive of the issues the
newspaper die tageszeitung (taz) has published since 1986. If
a researcher (the licencee) wants to obtain TüBa-D/Z, available
for academic purposes free of charge, he or she has to sign a
licence agreement with Tübingen University's Linguistics
Department (the licencer) which states that the licencer is the
copyright holder of the annotation and that the STC, as
published on the taz CD ROM, is copyrighted by contrapress

Digital Humanities 2007
media GmbH. The licencee has to certify that he, she or the
institution the person works for has a valid licence for this CD
ROM.1

regulations: full access to TüBa-D/Z requires a licence for the
taz CD ROM, whereas masked versions can be placed under,
say, the GNU Free Documentation or a Creative Commons
Licence. Therefore, a sustainability initiative has to come up
with a flexible system of representing the relationships and
dependencies between the STC and the different annotation
layers and their individual licence restrictions.

3 How to Mask Linguistic Resources
The easiest option to obfuscate an annotated corpus is to remove
the text. A less radical solution substitutes every STC character
with, for example, "x" and every digit with "0". In addition to
preserving word length, this process retains information on
upper and lower case by substituting these with "x" and "X"
(Toms & Campbell, 1999).

Figure 1: Masking linguistic corpora by example of the TüBa-D/Z treebank

We propose the notion of corpus masking, i. e., obfuscating the
STC, but not the annotation layer(s), the STC is "removed", so
that the original licensing restrictions no longer hold for the
"new" resource. The advantage is that the valuable annotation
information can be made available for free (see figure 1).2

2 Corpora – Licence Restrictions – Sustainability
When linguists have created a corpus it can become quite
difficult to gain access to the corpus once the project is finished.
In an ideal world, academics can turn to a sustainability
initiative in order to archive their datasets and to make them
available to other researchers, e. g., by means of a web-based
corpus platform (Dipper et al, 2006 & Schmidt et al 2006).
Apart from issues such as providing standardised markup
languages and metadata sets (Chiarcos et al, 2006 & Wörner
et al, 2006), sustainability initiatives have to take the copyright
of the original data into account.

We developed CorpusMasker, a Java-based tool for the
parameterised masking of linguistic resources represented as
XML documents. The XML element(s) or attribute(s) that
comprise the actual words or tokens to be masked (in case of
TüBa-D/Z, the <orth> element) can be specified to handle
arbitrary annotation schemes. CorpusMasker features a
dictionary approach: after collecting all word forms, every word
is mapped onto a randomly generated string and replaced by
that string. Word length can be retained, as well as information
on the distribution and positioning of vowels and consonants.
If a word is usually written with an initial lower case character
and that word appears with an initial upper case character, the
same randomised word is used (e. g., "dort" -> "kulp", "Dort"
-> "Kulp"). CorpusMasker performs an affix analysis that is
similar to morphology induction. The algorithm analyses certain
words, masks the roots, but retains the affixes, so that the text
is masked but valuable linguistic information that in itself is
insufficient to reconstruct the source text or even to interpret
the masked text, is kept intact for further analysis. Parameterised
masking can be performed with several different degrees of
retaining linguistic information, from the complete removal of
the STC to a rather light but sufficient masking that keeps, e.
g., closed word classes unchanged (see table 1; affixes are
marked in italics).3
Linguistic corpora often contain POS information so that the
randomisation process results in a list that could act as a key
to unlock the masked corpus, i. e., to reconstruct the STC. As
publication of this complete list would contradict the purpose
of the tool, we will only provide a reduced version of the file
so that the randomly generated words can be mapped onto POS
tags.

We developed a tool that is able to mask corpora on the fly.
Should someone who is interested in a corpus that is available
under a rigid licence model not have a valid STC licence, he
or she can still receive the corpus, albeit in masked form. A
corpus potentially can be associated with several accessibility
Page 167

structures are marked with the label KONJ; even without
knowledge of the word level the treebank annotation gives
sufficent information to examine parallelism effects with respect
to the structure of the conjuncts: syntactic categories,
grammatical functions, modifiers, and length, see, e. g., Levy
(2004), and Steiner (2006).

4 Masked Corpora: What are They Good for?
Our original goal had been to give researchers interested in
TüBa-D/Z the option of examining the annotation without
ordering the die tageszeitung CD ROM first. As our
sustainability platform will give access to copyrighted corpora,
we will implement the option of masking a corpus archive
before every single download to enhance security. Furthermore,
a password protected dictionary lookup could be provided that
enables researchers to retrieve a small amount of translations
from randomised strings back to original words. Following, we
sketch some application scenarios for masked corpora.
Unlexicalised parsing A masked corpus can be used for all
sorts of unlexicalised training. Charniak (1996) shows that an
unlexicalised PCFG trained on treebank annotations is
compatible with other unlexicalised parsers. In addition to the
masked training data, a minimal amount of testing data was
required. In the case of TüBa-D/Z this subcorpus could consist
of randomly shuffled example sentences from the treebank with
unmasked text and full annotation. Hinrichs et al. (2005) discuss
experiments in memory-based learning of anaphora resolution.
Their tool is trained on the annotation of TüBa-D/Z and does
not take lexical information into account. The features refer to
morphological properties, parts-of-speech, syntactic boundaries
and grammatical functions, all of which are available in the
annotation. In this case even the test data could be generated
directly from the masked resource since the annotation includes
marking of equivalence classes comprising pronouns and noun
phrases. The gold standard for testing consists of these
equivalence classes only in which the words are represented
by positional indices. The evaluation would then test whether
the relevant indices are grouped together correctly. A
comparable tool trained on masked corpus data could as well
be applied to `real' German texts.
Qualitative and quantitative analyses TüBa-D/Z's annotation
can be used for qualitative and quantitative analyses, it includes
both syntactic categories as well as grammatical functions. A
linguist can, for example, examine which categories occur as
predicatives (element PRED). In addition to this qualitative
investigation, the corpus also allows a quantitative analysis:
what percentage of predicatives is realised by a noun phrase,
what percentage is realised by an adjectival phrase or by a
prepositional phrase? To give a second example, coordinate
Page 168

Teaching linguistics and computational linguistics The masked
version of TüBa-D/Z contains an unnatural language that acts
like German syntaxwise, but the lexicon of this language
contains, for the most part, random strings and associated POS
tags. This fact makes the masked treebank a valuable resource
in the context of teaching computational linguistics. If students
have to work with a language that has a known syntax and a
rudimentary morphology but lexical entries that bear no
meaning whatsoever, they might be able to concentrate better
on the tasks of developing grammar rules or improving parsing
efficiency (e. g., with regard to unlexicalised parsing). This
approach of blanking out semantics is compatible with
Chomsky's notion of language as processing a set of symbols.4
Evaluating NLP software Another promising application
scenario is the evaluation of NLP software. Most tools use
n-gram language models, more sophisticated applications can
be trained on annotated corpora. With a masked resource it is
possible to measure the influence syntactic annotations have
concerning precision and recall, as the performance data of an
NLP tool with regard to original, as well as slightly and fully
masked corpora can be compared. This approach could result
in substantial arguments in favour, or against the use of
treebanks for training NLP tools.

5 Related Work
Anonymisation methods remove proper nouns and other
identity-revealing phrases to protect the privacy of the people
mentioned in a text (for example, medical or legal records (Corti
et al, 2006, Medlock, 2006, Poesio et al, 2006, & Rock, 2001)).
A second application area is concerned with the removal of
cues that might reveal the identity of the author of a text. A
third area concerns the masking, or obfuscation of texts, as
described in the present paper; we are not aware of similar
approaches to the masking of linguistic resources.5

6 Concluding Remarks
We call our approach parameterised masking because the
randomisation process can be influenced with regard to several
parameters, so that, for example, certain word classes are not
randomised. Typically, when closed word classes such as
determiners and prepositions are kept intact, at least part of the
original meaning of a sentence can be guessed. This leads us
to a crucial question: what happens if we choose to mask only
a small number of words (for example, only proper nouns)?

Digital Humanities 2007
Do we have to mask a certain percentage of words, in order to
bypass the STC's licensing restrictions? When does a text that
has been masked only minimally become the original text again,
so that the licence restrictions prohibited the distribution of the
pseudo-masked linguistic resource?

comprise several annotation layers created by more than one
research group, each group can be considered the creator of its
annotation layer and can decide its terms of distribution (as a
consequence, every annotation layer should potentially comprise
a complete metadata record). Commercially available software
tools that were used in the annotation process might restrict the
terms of distribution of the resulting data set as well.

Literate Documentation for XML

The Current State of XML
Documentation

C

urrent practices for the documentation of XML schema
have not progressed much beyond the recommendations
made in Eve Maler and Jeanne El Andaloussi’s (1996) text
Developing SGML DTD’s: From Text to Model to Markup.
That volume recommended an approach to DTD design called
document type modeling to SGML DTD designers that, if
followed, produces both a reusable and customizable DTD and
a well-structured reference manual that documents that DTD.
Despite the development of XML itself, multiple XML schema
languages, and the proliferation of XML applications across
many disciplines this is still about all the documentation most
XML applications provide today. In fact in many cases the
documentation provided is much more inconsistent and
haphazard than that recommended by Maler and El Andaloussi.
The lack of consistent and structured prose documentation is
especially problematic to humanists who use XML. To a
humanist creating finding aids, marking up historic texts, or
preparing a text for linguistic analysis the clear communication
of the markup language designer’s intentions is critical in
making decisions on how to properly apply markup.
The problem of interpreting the designer’s intentions is
compounded by the fact that XML lacks a formalized,
machine-readable knowledge representation technology that
allows a designer to explicitly represent in unambiguous fashion
the semantics of a XML application (Renear et al., 2002). Given
the difficulties that researchers working in this area have made
towards realizing a system that can reliably represent
machine-readable markup semantics (Dubin et al., 2002)(Dubin
et al., 2003) (Dubin, 2003) (Dubin and Birnbaum,
2004)(Marcoux, 2006) it may be more profitable to experiment
with a system that can improve the quality of the prose
documentation made available with XML applications.
This project proposes a XML schema authoring environment
based on the literate programming paradigm that also contains
constructs that force the markup language designer to

Page 170

Digital Humanities 2007
consistently and unambiguously document the application using
natural language. This approach can help bridge the gap
between current XML documentation practices until tools that
can specify machine-readable semantics for XML appear in
the future.

Literate Programming and XML

L

iterate programming directs the author specify both the
program source and the prose documentation for that code
within the same file (Knuth 1984). This file is then fed through
a processor that produces both executable program code and
formatted prose documentation for the program. A XML literate
programming environment produces both a validating schema
and prose documentation for that schema. The experimental
XML literate programming system sketched out in this project
utilizes the Text Encoding Initiative’s One Document Does it
All (ODD) literate programming system.
The TEI P5 (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2005), the most
recent revision of the guidelines, has substantially updated the
ODD system. The guidelines now use Relax NG for the
validating schema component and formally include and
document the elements and attributes that make up the ODD
system (Burnard and Rahtz, 2004). This new module (Chapter
27) provides TEI users a formal way to document local
customizations of the TEI and produce consistent,
well-formatted prose documentation for these extensions. The
documentation chapter of the TEI P5 describing the ODD states
that the ODD is not restricted to just serving as the means to
document and generate the TEI, but can also be used to
document and produce a schema for any type of markup scheme
(Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2005).

The ODD+

T

his project takes advantage of the general purpose
component of the ODD to create an experimental general
purpose XML literate programming system that could be termed
the ODD+. The support for modularity, element and attribute
classes, schema customization, and XML namespaces within
the ODD (Burnard and Rahtz, 2004) make it an ideal tool to
make up the core of a literate programming system for XML.
The advance of the ODD+ system will be the provision of a
“semantic checklist” that the author must complete for each
element and attribute in a XML application. This checklist will
force the markup language designer to document new elements
or attributes with precision and consistency. If the checklist is
not properly completed the ODD+ processor will fail. The
ODD+ application will be implemented by using the TEI P5
extension mechanism to extend the current ODD module to

include the elements and attributes that will be necessary to
implement the ODD+.

Identifying the Semantic Checklist

W

hat sort of questions will be included in the semantic
checklist? The researchers who have investigated the
question of XML semantics have identified a number of
constructs that occur within markup that seem appropriate
candidates for inclusion in the semantic checklist (Renear et
al., 2002)(Sperberg-McQueen, Huitfeldt, and Renear, 2000).
The questions identified by these researchers include:
1. Can an element have different meanings depending on the
content within it is used?
2. Issues of propagation: does the property declared by a given
element or attribute apply to child elements, their attributes,
and character data contained within them?
3. Issues of class memberships:
1. Does the element or attribute serve as a superclass?
2. Is the element or attribute derived from another?
4. Relationships to other elements:
1. What are the properties that a parent child relationship
implies?
2. What are the properties that a sibling relationship
implies?
The author will report on the difficulty of integrating the above
questions and others into a workable semantic checklist that
can be deployed within a general purpose literate programming
system for XML like the ODD. The author will experiment
with the ODD+ system and widely used XML applications in
the humanities, such as the TEI itself or the Metadata Encoding
and Transmission Standard (METS). The author will work with
interesting subsets within each application and produce
documentation for them using ODD+. This will illustrate the
viability of the ODD+ as a potential general purpose literate
programming tool for XML.
The author will experiment with different techniques that will
strive to ensure consistency of format and language usage in
the prose documentation produced by the ODD+. These may
come in the form of Schematron rules written to ensure that
the author uses language consistency when discusses issues of
propagation for example. The author may also experiment with
XSLT templates that may contain the outlines of statements
that describe class relationships within a XML schema. These
outline statements could then be filled in with the specific
element or attribute names of the language designer’s schema.
This approach is an approximation of the skeleton sentence
Page 171

Digital Humanities 2007
technique suggested by Sperberg-McQueen, Huitfeldt, and
Renear (2000). The author will report the results of these various
experiments and present a demonstration of the ODD+ system.

Digital Text Projects in Eastern
Europe: Promoting International
Interoperability
Miranda Remnek (mremnek@uiuc.edu)
Slavic & Eastern European Library
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

T

he widely divergent languages and cultures of Russia,
Eastern Europe & Eurasia (hereafter Eastern Europe),
present a rich terrain for digital scholarship, but owing to a
number of factors—including poorly-endowed or
mutually-incompatible infrastructures, language barriers, and
different approaches to the construction of metadata—the
corpora already in existence and those in development are often
poorly known elsewhere, and in many cases are hidden from
international resource discovery and data sharing.
In view of this situation, it was clear to the Digital Projects
Subcommittee of the American Association for the Advancement
of Slavic Studies (<http://www.aaass.org>) that
improved documentation would constitute an important step
toward the promotion of knowledge sharing and
interoperability.1 The Slavic & East European Library at UIUC
is therefore building an international Inventory of Slavic, East
European and Eurasian Digital Projects (<http://www.l
ibrary.uiuc.edu/spx/inventory>). The Inventory
already describes at least 360 collections in 110 projects, and
we also foresee web submissions from international partners
to promote collaborative registration. But even now the
Inventory is heavily used; recent statistics indicate that in the
period July 2005-June 2006 it received around 25,000 hits. It
has also become an OAI Data Provider, and although inventory
contents (unlike the digital collections they record) are
sometimes not reflected in aggregated search services like
OAIster (<http://oaister.umdl.umich.edu/o/oa
ister/>), the Inventory’s records have indeed been harvested
and now display in OAIster searches—likely to improve
dramatically the visibility of substantive digital projects in the
Slavic field.
But the project goals go far beyond the compilation of a mere
inventory. Besides the implementation of intensive content
development, promotion of metadata standardization, expanded
reference assistance and interactive user options, the Inventory
will focus on an expansion of the OAI data provider system
and item-level harvesting. (It also hopes to explore customized

delivery services and an archival framework for at-risk
collections in the Slavic field, currently being explored through
an inter-institutional grant proposal).
Nevertheless, the project team acknowledges that metadata
practices in Eastern Europe are still very diverse, and far from
standardized. At one end of the scale, where relatively simple
encoding is involved, even schemes like Dublin Core are poorly
recognized. This makes the implementation of relatively
well-established data-sharing protocols like OAI-PMH (Open
Archives Initiative: Protocol for Metadata Harvesting) little
known in Eastern Europe. A registry of OAI data providers at
UIUC demonstrates that while OAI data providers are well
established in the US and Western Europe, they are much less
widely encountered further East.2 True, the implementation of
OAI data interchange is not necessarily well standardized in
countries with far more providers.3 Furthermore, the whole
question of the efficacy of OAI-PMH as a metadata transfer
protocol is still somewhat open to question.4 Nevertheless, its
power is generally well-recognized, and its further penetration
into Eastern Europe is certainly a desirable goal.
At the other end of the scale, the level of deep encoding is even
less widely standardized in Eastern Europe. The decade-long
Institute of World Literature project in Moscow known as FEB
(Fundamental'naia elektronaia biblioteka) (<http://www.
feb-web.ru/>) has an enviable collection of over 50,000
Russian literature texts, all heavily encoded in SGML—but not
according to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Guidelines.
True, the TEI is not a standard, but interoperability with such
an impressive collection would be highly desirable. Other such
examples are available. To be sure, there are exceptions: the
recent TEI meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria revealed the extent to
which TEI projects are beginning to gain root in South Eastern
Europe.5 There are also similar developments in a more abstract
sense. The TEI Guidelines have been translated into Russian,6
and efforts are also being made to promote the further
internationalization of the Guidelines, and to ensure their
availability in a greater number of languages, including
Bulgarian.
Yet even when East European scholarly projects adopt the TEI,
standardized approaches to the conversion of metadata to
OAI-compliant formats are also at issue, and there is evidently
much ground still to be covered. Hence, the object of this paper
will be to:
1. Design and conduct a survey of metadata practices in a
number of East European digital centers (including existing
UIUC partners) that are sponsored both by institutions and
by individual faculty teams;
2. Produce an up-to-date analysis of their awareness,
evaluation and observance of international metadata
standards;
Page 173

Digital Humanities 2007
3. Identify problems and practices preventing their
implementation;
4. Suggest ways in which steps can be taken to ameliorate this
situation, including crosswalks and other technical
procedures.
The results of this exercise will not only assist in a practical
sense the development of the Inventory of Slavic, East European
and Eurasian Digital Projects (the only registry of substantive,
scholarly East European digital initiatives), but will also result
in better awareness and information-sharing among Slavic
digital practitioners. This is especially vital as the institutional
repository movement gains ground.7 Experience shows,
particularly in West Europe, that the issue of standardized
metadata is paramount, and that subject repositories are
becoming of even greater interest since they tend to be
populated by scholars working on their own projects and
producing more substantive metadata. In this environment, East
European scholars should not excluded from the pool of
informed experience.

1. Other points in the group’s charge include: (2) fostering informed
participation in future initiatives; (3-4) increasing digital
information and training opportunities for Slavic librarians; (5)
complementing national efforts to establish digital repositories.
See <http://www.library.uiuc.edu/spx/BnD

/DigPro.htm#charge>
2. See <http://gita.grainger.uiuc.edu/regis
try/ListTLDs.asp>. U.S. providers are proliferating: in
the past year the number of “edu” domains increased from 265 to
332, and “org” domains from 149 to 182. Likewise in Western
Europe: U.K. DPs went from 89 to 114, Germany from 73 to 99.
But in Eastern Europe it is different; the totals for Hungary (4),
Czech Republic (2) and Slovenia (2) stayed the same this year,
and Russia increased only slightly, from 3 to 4. Only Poland
increased significantly, from 4 to 18.
3. As reported at the Oct. 2005 OAI workshop in Geneva, the German
Initiative for Networked Information (DINI) has installed a
certificate system in order to bring OAI providers into greater
standardization.
4. The Open Archives Initiative OAI-Implementers group announced
on Nov. 3 2005 that it is “studying the effectiveness of OAI and

behind. In July 2006 there were 144 DSpace instances worldwide,
and less than half were in the U.S. and U.K. (62), indicating that

many non-English-speaking countries (like Japan) are aware of
and attracted to this increasingly popular open source software.
But in Eastern Europe only 2 DSpace sites were listed (in Russia).
This lack of awareness was substantiated at an e-text conference
in Eastern Russia in July 2006 entitled Modern Informational
Technologies and Written Heritage: From Ancient Manuscripts
to Electronic Texts at which I gave a presentation entitled
“Promoting the TEI in scholarly communities: OAI harvesting,
digital repositories.” Conference attendees described many
sophisticated projects, but there was little familiarity with OAI or
digital repository software used in the West. One scholar was
familiar with these technologies, but in a presentation entitled: “A
Computer System for the Creation and Maintenance of Electronic
Collections of Ancient Texts,” V. S. Iuzhikov (Kazan State
University) wrote: “For the creation and development of electronic
libraries there are several systems. Among the best known are
Greenstone and DSpace. But they are oriented mostly toward text
libraries with small number of illustrations, which are poorly suited
for the collection of old printed works. Therefore it is less
time-consuming and gives better result to build a local system.”
Given the specialized nature of his material, this conclusion was
understandable. Yet the general lack of East European involvement
with these international standards and methodologies remains true.

Abstract

H

umanities computing must make conceptual modeling
one of its defining activities. This is necessary not only
to provide more effective computational support for scholarship
in the humanities, but also in order for humanities computing
itself to become something more than a “bag of tricks”. This
paper describes promising developments already underway in
several areas within humanities computing, generalizes from
past, if partial, successes (text encoding), draws parallels with
recent work in bioinformatics, and argues that the logical
identity of conceptual modeling and theory-construction makes
conceptual modeling simply a computationally oriented variant
of scientific explanation, and, more broadly, interpretation and
understanding in general. As an example of how model
development can provide fundamental insights into the cultural
world a case is described where a set of ontology evaluation
criteria developed within computer science is applied to an
influential framework for cultural entities and the result that a
radical reconfiguration of that framework is suggested.

influenced by seminal papers on these issues by Willard
McCarty and John Unsworth; I acknowledge a debt to them
without of course any suggestion that they see things as
described here.

Introduction

T

he nature of humanities computing has long been
problematic in the digital humanities community. Part of
the reason for this anxiety is that humanities computing is
struggling to move out of a pre-scientific phase. “Science” here
is of course intended to be taken in the broadest possible sense
— the point is not to separate disciplines such as physics on
the one hand from, say, literary studies on the other, but rather
to distinguish practices that have primarily non-epistemic
non-theoretical objectives from those that have understanding,

explanation, and knowledge as their principal immediate goals.
Nor is there any implication of a clear boundary between
scientific practices and non-scientific practices, or that there
isn’t a complex and essential mutual involvement — the claim
is only that some rough distinction of this sort is possible and
useful.
If humanities computing is to mature as a coherent field of
intellectual inquiry it will need to make a transition from being
an ad hoc set of useful techniques, to more systematic general
methods and theories that make direct contact with the specific
methods and theories of the disciplines it supports. This theme
is not new, but our progress has been modest so far and some
further discussion and elaboration is in order.
First, there are new reasons to be optimistic. For one thing this
progress is already occurring in other informatics
fields—bioinformatics as an example—and the specifics of
these changes provide an indication of how things might go in
humanities computing as well. Moreover the growing
significance of conceptual models and ontologies that is already
in evidence in humanities computing, and the nature of the
discourse around them, is a sign that this transition is perhaps
already underway. Finally one of the most theoretically
productive areas within the humanities computing community,
namely text encoding, arguably has been as successful as it has
precisely to the extent that it has embodied the features
recommended here — and owes its limitations and
disappointments to the extent to which it has not. What all these
things have in common is the foregrounding of conceptual
modeling, explicitly or implicitly.
I use the term “conceptual modeling” broadly, meaning any
formally defined abstract representation of a domain of interest.
Typical examples of modeling languages are the ER and UML
diagrams used in business applications, logic-based knowledge
representation formalisms such as description logics or the
frame languages (such as the KL-ONE family) common in
artificial intelligence, and the various formal ontologies now
used in computational biology and elsewhere
Science in the broad sense is the development of understanding.
Scientific understanding comes typically in the form of theories,
and theories are at least in part the systematic identification of
objects and relationships that are the salient features of some
domain. Informatic disciplines must put these theories,
formalized as conceptual models that support computational
processing, at the center of their identity. And for informatic
disciplines to be sciences themselves they must not only exploit
such conceptual models, but participate in their development
and exploration. This is true for informatics in general, and for
humanities computing in particular.

Modeling in Bioinformatics

O

ther areas that began as craft-like bag-of-tricks
approaches to applying computing to a scientific field
have now begun to evolve a more coherent body of method,
theory, and metatheory. Perhaps the most dramatic case is
bioinformatics. Although initially a haphazard and opportunistic
application of computing techniques, there are now a
considerable number of families of well-theorized methods
tightly tied to biological theory. Of particular interest here is
the role of so-called ontologies in contemporary bioinformatics
such as the Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000), the
Foundational Model of Anatomy (Rossee & Mejino, 2003),
and other ontologies in genomics, molecular function,
neuroscience, biodiversity, and other areas of the life sciences
as well. An enormous amount of effort is going into the
development and use of these formal models.
In some cases the influence on biological science per se has
still been modest, but generally the results are extremely
promising and in a few cases the influence has been stunning.
The Gene Ontology in particular, has been enormously
successful and provides the overall framework for contemporary
genomics. Of special significance for us is the extent to which
the fundamental explanatory entities and properties of biological
theories are explicitly identified as the core constituents of these
conceptual models, blending the work of first order science
with its bioinformatics support.

Modeling in the Cultural Sciences

W

ithin the humanities computing community text
encoding systems such as the TEI can be seen as a step
in the same direction as the new ontology-based models in
computational biology. Behind the methods of the TEI is at
least arguably an informal positing of text models, components,
and relationships. However unlike the bioinformatic ontologies
the models being indicated by text encoding techniques are
only indirectly and implicitly identified. This has been pointed
out by a number of critics (Raymond & Tompa, 1992;
Raymond, Tompa, & Wood, 1996, 1998, 2001; Buzzetti, 2002),
and projects to develop remedies are underway
(Sperberg-McQueen et al., 2002; Renear et al., 2003).
Another promising sign are the ontologies being developed in
museum studies CIDOC/CRM (Crofts et al., 2003) and library
science (IFLA 1998). For the most part these are being put
forward as frameworks for designing digital information
management systems or shaping the development of standards,
policies, and procedures, but to the extent that they succeed at
efficient, functional, and interoperable systems they may be
considered confirmed as substantive theoretical proposals for
Page 176

how to understand the nature of the cultural world. And where
these models and ontologies appear to be applications of
existing explanatory theories of cultural objects and
relationships that is more evidence that they are achievements
which advance our understanding of that world.

An Example: Revising FRBR

W

hat follows is an example intended to support two
claims. First that the evolution of conceptual models
intended to support information systems design can in fact be
an activity of first order science (in the broad sense), and second
that precisely the same techniques designed for general
evaluation of ontologies in natural science can be effectively
employed in evaluating cultural ontologies.
Several models for cultural objects identify such things as
works, texts, editions, and individual items as types of things,
fundamental kinds. Not only are various sorts of conceptual
arguments advanced in favor of such an analysis, but so is the
relative success of such frameworks in guiding the design of
effective information systems that are effective, efficient, and
interoperable. That is, the conceptual and practical success of
these systems can be taken as indicating that they correctly
represent how things are. A well-known model of this sort is
IFLA’s Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records
(IFLA 1998), a framework designed primarily to support library
cataloguing, but which clearly has wider application — FRBR
in fact describes itself as a “conceptual model of the
bibliographic universe”.
A puzzle recently emerged about an assignment of one
particular cultural object (XML documents, as defined in the
W3C XML standard) to the appropriate FRBR entity type.
Some considerations argued for an assignment to the FRBR
expression (roughly: text) entity type, and other competing
considerations argued for assignment to the FRBR manifestation
(roughly: edition, or format) entity type. The proposed
resolution was an awkward and unsatisfying exception to the
FRBR framework which preserved the ontology of works,
expressions, editions, at the cost of complexities elsewhere.
(Renear et al 2002, Renear 2005).
Two years later however it was noted that when a proposed
criterion for ontology evaluation which had been developed
for scientific and general purpose ontologies (Guarino & Welty,
2000; Guarino & Welty, 2002) was applied to the FRBR
framework the result was an anomaly that suggested refactoring
the four Group 1 entity types into new entities and
corresponding roles. (Renear, 2006). Under the resulting revised
model the manifestation and expression entity types are not
treated as true entity types (fundamental kinds), but rather roles
(relationships) that entities of other types have in particular

Digital Humanities 2007
circumstances—and in fact this revision was extended to all
four FRBR entities (Renear & Dubin, forthcoming). We realized
that this new way of conceptualizing cultural objects appeared
to be an application of a more general approach developed by
John Searle (1995) as well as consistent with some work in
aesthetics (Levinson 1980). In short, all four FRBR “entities”
can be reinterpreted not as entities but as roles that other
non-cultural things have under specific social contexts of
“collective intentionality”.
That this is not just a practical adjustment in a conceptual model
for humanities computing, but a substantive claim in the science
of cultural objects in general, can be established by comparing
it to familiar claims about cultural objects by scholars such as
Ingarden, Wellek, Richards, Fish, Goodman, Tanselle,
Schillingsburg and others. In this comparison contradiction will
serve as well as convergence to make the point that these
assertions fall within the domain of humanist inquiry, and not
merely within some auxiliary practice.

The Relative Neutrality of these
Recommendations

I

t may be thought that putting conceptual modeling at the
heart of humanities computing and seeing the development
of models as first order scholarship in the humanities requires
accepting some archaic and dubious philosophical view, a
positivistic scientism perhaps, or even philosophical realism.
But this is not so. It is possible to engage in ontology without
taking a philosophical meta-ontological position. Many different
philosophical positions (including constructivism and
relativism) are all perfectly consistent with taking conceptual
modeling as the natural activity of humanities computing, and
at least part of humanities scholarship more generally. Of course
the results of modeling will not be neutral vis-à-vis other first
order theories, but the activity of modeling need not be
exceptionally controversial. Again the experience of
bioinformatics, where researchers with different philosophical
views (or no philosophical views at all) nevertheless often agree,
or more importantly disagree, on specific issues without
rejecting the overall approach, is significant.
This is not to say that the position is entirely neutral. It may
well conflict with some general accounts of humanistic inquiry
which hold that such inquiry is radically different than the
natural sciences, especially if those accounts are understood as
applying in general or without exception to the entire range of
humanistic scholarship — although I am not yet convinced that
it does in fact conflict with the traditions of hermeneutics and
verstehen, despite the differences in tone and direction. In any
case that the recommendation is not entirely uncontroversial
cannot be taken as a decisive mark against it at the outset.

Whether it is sound or not will depend on how it fares against
its competitors in improving our knowledge and understanding
of the cultural world.

Concluding Remarks

I

have argued that humanities computing must make
conceptual modeling its central defining activity if it is to
fully realize its promise to substantially advance humanities
scholarship, and that such modeling is an intrinsic part of first
order humanities inquiry, and not merely an auxiliary activity.

The AXE Tool Suite: Tagging
Across Time and Space
Doug Reside (dreside@umd.edu)
Maryland Institute of Technology in the
Humanities (MITH)

S

ince the codification of the Text Encoding Initiative
standards in the mid-1990s, the process of the creation of
digital editions and archives is largely one of "marking up"
existing texts in XML. Originally, this was often done "by
hand." Scholars would add XML tags to existing text documents
using a text editor-a tedious process often fraught with errors.
Over the last decade several tools have been produced which
make this process somewhat more efficient and accurate, though
most still require more than a beginners familiarity with XML
encoding, and few are open source. Moreover, many digital
humanities projects have, of late, become far more
multi-medial--relying on image, video, and audio files as well
as text. Existing markup tools have only begun to work with
these non-textual artifacts. As digital archives continue to grow,
the markup tools used to encode them must become more
flexible and easier to use. The Ajax XML Encoder (AXE),
developed at the Maryland Institute for Technology in the
Humanities (MITH) is intended to be the tool suite that meets
this need.
AXE is a free tool suite that will allow users with limited
technical skills to deeply tag text, images, video, and audio files
for inclusion in digital archives. The program combines and
extends the functionality of proprietary online tools such as
YouTube and Flickr in a (mostly) open source1, web-based
platform for scholarly use. The tagging tool is designed in
AJAX and Macromedia Flash and generates and uses a MySQL
database. Like the mythological Ajax's axe, MITH's AXE
provides users with enough power and flexibility to accomplish
their tasks without a great deal of assistance from higher powers
(the technical or professorial "gods" graduate student workers
must often invoke when using earlier encoding tools).
Users of this tool are divided into two classes: managing editors
and editor-users. Managing editors are permitted to define the
sorts of tags all users can use and are able to remove items from
the database. All users, however, are able to add new
multimedia content to the database, tag it, and search for
preexisting content in the database. Tagging is naturally
accomplished in different ways depending on the media. For
sound files, an mp3 file is played through a Flash plug-in. When

the user pauses a sound file once, the timing is recorded. When
the user pauses the file again, the end time is recorded and the
user is presented with a web-based form to tag the selection. If
appropriate, a textual transcript of the sound with corresponding
times can be made. Providing a tool for image tagging was
more difficult. Although popular websites like Myspace and
Facebook provide some models for folksonomic image tagging,
the tag-spaces are usually limited to regular polygons (like
squares) and do not store the resulting data in a form that can
be easily shared. A better model for image tagging is the
ARCHway Project's "Image Tagger," described in the June
2006 issue of the International Journal on Digital Libraries by
designers Dekhtyar, Iacob, Jaromczyk, Kiernan, Moore, and
Porter . The program is hindered, though, by the clumsy
Java-based interface that requires users to install and learn
specialized software. Our program uses an AJAX website which
allows the user to add points to an image map (represented on
the image itself via a 1 pixel div element with a red border)
[see figure 1]. Once the image map is drawn, the user can
describe it with tags defined by the editor (or editors) of the
project. The entire image can also be so described

Figure 1

Video tagging, as one might expect, uses a combination of the
image and audio tagging methods. The video is first converted
to flash movie format using FFMpeg. The audio portion of the
movie is handled in exactly the same way as stand alone audio.
The visual portion of the movie is handled with a combination
of the techniques used for images and sound. The user can tag,
for instance, the start and end times of a particular segment and
add metadata to this portion. AXE even allows users to tag
images within the frames of movie files. If the user wished, for
instance, to tag a tree in the background of a shot, the user first
marks the time period in which the appropriate image appears.
A user-defined number of the frames from this segment are
then stacked and rendered translucent. With some adjustments,
the user can then click a series of coordinates which define the
selection over the space of the segment. This process is rendered
through Javascript and Macromedia's Flash.
Once all the tags have been created, they are parsed into a
mySQL database (the XML is generated first to allow users to
work offline and then feed the XML to the database later). This
Page 179

Digital Humanities 2007
database can be searched through traditional keyword or tag
cloud searches, but the interface also allows guided browsing.
When the user views a multimedia object, the user is also
presented with a series of "related" objects (after the
e-commerce model in which customers are presented with a
series of products related to one they are currently viewing). If
the user selects a sub-element in the document (perhaps
something like a tree in the background of a photograph), the
"related" documents will change to reflect relationships centered
on the user's choice. The user can also set global limits to what
suggestions are made. The related documents will change to
reflect user selection of sub-elements. The user can set global
limits on what relations are presented (e.g. related documents
must be dated after the current document). New tags and
documents from remote sites can also be added to the database
by editor-users. Later users can decide whose tags they trust
and block those by anonymous or unreliable taggers.
AXE is currently being used in a project headed by Angel David
Nieves to create a multi-perspective history of a 1976 student
uprising in Soweto, South Africa. Dr. Nieves has an enormous
wealth of multimedia primary documents surrounding the event
and hoped that the mass of materials would provide new ways
of telling the story. We needed, however, to process and present
this material in an unbiased way that allowed for multiple
interpretations of the events. AXE is being used to create an
interface which, as much as possible, left the arrangement and
interpretation of the materials up to the individual users.
AXE may eventually prove essential in the creation of digital
library archives. Although academic libraries are now fairly
adept at the digital preservation of textual material, few libraries
provide searchable digital archives of sound and video. As the
average available bandwidth of both users and institutions
increase, software will be needed to allow the cataloging and
access of this material. AXE seeks to fill this need.

1. Although all code written at MITH will be published on the web,
the use of Adobe's Flash prevents the project from being truly
open source.

Digital Humanties! The Musical
Doug Reside (dreside@umd.edu)
Maryland Institute for Technology in the
Humanities (MITH)

I

t has now been twenty-five years since the development of
the first personal computer, and while many humanities
scholars have begun to explore how these machines might assist
them in their work, there have been very few attempts to
consider how electronic tools might be used to study musical
theater. Musical theater seems particularly well-suited, though,
to the multimedia capabilities of the modern PC. David Saltz’s
Virtual Vaudevilleand the “Web Operas” on Paul Howarth and
Jim Farron’s Gilbert and Sullivan Archive prove that dramatic
text and music can be presented together in interesting ways
through a digital interface. However, neither is precisely the
right model for presenting musical theatre texts. This
presentation will describe the particular suitability of
contemporary musical theater for electronic presentation and
will demonstrate the author’s electronic edition of the musical
Parade.
The electronic edition of Parade serves as a prototype for an
upcoming series of electronic critical editions musical theater
texts the author is currently working with the Library of
Congress to develop. Using the standards designed by the Text
Encoding Initiative (TEI), the text of the Broadway and the
touring version of the libretto of Parade were encoded into one
file. Textual, critical, and explanatory notes were also encoded
in the text using the same system. The text is presented in an
interactive AJAX website. Users can choose how much of these
texts to view and the way in which they should be displayed.
This functionality allows users to compare varying versions of
the text and score side by side, or (using transparency) even
one on top of the other. When the user clicks the lyrics of a
song, the music begins playing at the beginning of the associated
section and stops at the end (or when paused by the user).
Analytical tools such as an automated collation feature, an
exhaustive concordance of every word in the libretto, and a
tool which extracts all the lines for a particular character along
with cue lines to aid actors in memorization of their parts are
also included. Future editions will include tools that will allow
users to analyze patterns in the textual, musical, and
terpsichorean languages of the poem. For example, a
concordance of words will be linked to a concordance of
musical phrases and both, in turn, will be linked to a
concordance of choreographed movements. Videos of dance
numbers will be linked to computer animations of the

Digital Humanities 2007
movements of individual dancers. The early versions of these
features will also be demonstrated in this presentation.
This presentation will also describe how such editions will
benefit musical theater studies. Musical theater scholarship is
growing rapidly. An increasing number of scholarly works are
being published by academic presses, and in the past year alone
there were over fifty dissertations written on the topic. While
this scholarship is promising, the academy as a whole remains
relatively uninterested in the musical. A recent panel on
composer-lyricist Stephen Sondheim was scheduled for the
Modern Language Association’s annual conference but was
later cancelled for lack of interest. The musical is still usually
relegated to popular culture studies and is rarely included in
the syllabi of contemporary drama courses. In part, this may
be a reaction to the preponderance of mostly formulaic works
in the genre. Today, aside from revivals and the occasional
limited run at Lincoln Center, artistic (as opposed to purely
commercially driven) musicals can rarely generate enough
investor interest to go on Broadway. The creators of artistic
musical theater bemoan the fact there is not a venue for their
work. In a recent article for Opera News, musical theater
composer Michael John LaChiusa (composer-lyricist of many
recent artistic musicals), writes of recent Broadway hits, “All
sense of invention and craft is abandoned in favor of delivering
what the artist thinks a musical should deliver.”1
Composer-lyricist Jason Robert Brown echoes this complaint
in an interview with the author, “Only in [today’s Broadway]
musicals do things exist with the sole purpose of entertaining
their people and not hoping to make them think about the
world.” It could be that these are nothing but the complaints of
artists unable to achieve widespread commercial success, yet
the fact remains that the Broadway musical has, in the last
fifteen years, almost completely consisted of light comedy and
pastiche.
Significantly, although non-musical plays suffer many of the
same pressures, a few serious plays regularly open and close
on Broadway every season. A play can afford to fail, not only
because production costs for plays are usually lower than for
musicals, but because it is viewed as “high art.” Producers are
more willing to lose money on plays because they are
contributing to works of “cultural importance.” The musical,
on the other hand, is trapped in a degrading cycle. The scholarly
community, which might elevate the cultural respectability of
the musical, generally ignores the form because so few musicals
are artistically interesting (thereby withholding the cultural
blessing which might inspire producers to fund more interesting
musicals).

first musical for which the libretto was commercially published,
went on to become the first musical to win Pulitzer prize.
Unfortunately, the full text of a musical is often available only
to theater practitioners who rent the performance texts from
theater licensing companies for a production. Despite Stephen
Sondheim’s reputation, there is, at the time of this writing, no
commercially published libretto of his Merrily We Roll Along
or Saturday Night If Arthur Miller’s or Tom Stoppard’s work
were available only under such conditions one wonders if the
literary community would have been so willing to embrace
them.
Of course, the extremely multi-medial nature of musical theater
makes the traditional codex a clumsy tool for presenting editions
of the texts. Further, musicals often exist in many different
versions with no one text definitely representing the title. The
musical Show Boat , for instance, may be better thought of as
the sum of the total of all its major incarnations rather than as
any one production. Although this notion of textuality is
difficult to represent in print, it is well-suited for an electronic
edition. Further, electronic editions will assist not only
individual scholars of musical theater, but instructors of the
form as well. Teaching close reading of musical theater texts
has always been an awkward matter. The problem of linking
text to sound and the limited available of important texts often
force instructors to assign videotaped or movie versions of the
works. This approach does not encourage careful study of the
written words of the musical. If scholarly electronic editions
of musical theater are eventually produced, it may be that
musical theater will finally find a firm footing in academic
scholarship. The first printed libretto of a musical won a Pulitzer
Prize. It seems possible electronic editions will increase the
respectability of an art form that is even now slowly finding its
deserved place in literary scholarship. Perhaps scholarly interest
will generate more funding for serious musicals. Optimistic
thoughts, to be sure—perhaps better suited for a Rodgers and
Hammerstein song than a conference presentation. Still, at the
very least, electronic editions of musical theater will provide a
new way of studying and experiencing this important art form.

One way to break the cycle may be to provide scholars with
better access to the best works of musical theater. There is
evidence that increased access to the material can lead to
increased cultural respect. The Gershwin’s Of Thee I Sing, the

Why Take Games Seriously?
Digital Humanities and the Study
of Games
Jason C. Rhody (jasonrhody@gmail.com)
University of Maryland at College Park

U

ntil recently, the study of games from a humanities
perspective has been a surprisingly impoverished field,
with the relatively few titles generally philosophical or
ethnographic in nature. Yet the recent rise of game studies has
generated a wealth of scholarship as interdisciplinary as the
games themselves. What is it about computer games that caused
such an increase in attention? Why do these games merit such
scrutiny? With a robust industry comprised of both popular and
independent studios that have produced thousands of virtual
worlds and environments, computer games have become one
of the fastest rising modes of new media expression. As Janet
Murray asserts, "the largest commercial success and the greatest
creative effort in digital narrative have so far been in the area
of computer games" (Hamlet on the Holodeck 51). If the
computer represents a “single new medium of representation,
the digital medium, formed by the braided interplay of technical
invention and cultural expression,” (Murray, New Media
Theory Reader 3), the game is its most prominent genre,
simulating sport, adventure, exploration, war, economies, and
even life itself. In fewer than fifty years, computer games have
grown from allowing text-based adventurers to crawl through
fictionalized caves to generating miles upon miles of virtual
landscape inhabited by its digital citizens and with economies
rivaling that of several real-world countries. Whereas a single
white dot once floated across a dark screen in an abstraction of
table tennis, players can now top-spin their way through the
rankings at a virtual Grand Slam tournament.
This paper examines both the long and short history of gaming
and its scholarship within a humanities context, arguing that
games play a crucial role in any serious academic study of new
media and within the overarching framework of the digital
humanities. After an overview detailing how games have
influenced and engaged with traditional humanities topics, I
discuss three ways that games should be taken seriously in the
digital humanities: as models for learning and rhetoric (as with
the “Serious Games” movement); as objects that are part of the
larger digital media ecology desperately in need of preservation;
and as objects of critical study. In short, this paper addresses
why, and how, humanities scholars should take games seriously.
Page 182

I begin with a brief review of games’ rich ‘long history’ in the
humanities, which includes art both about games, such as the
11th-century Chinese painting of “Ladies Playing Double
Sixes,” and the artistry of games, such as the pieces from a
19th-century Indian chess set, whose delicate nature suggests
that they are as much decorative as functional. From a cultural
historical perspective, games reveal much about social
hierarchies: the extravagance of the late sixteenth-century
Moghul ruler Akbar, who had elaborate Pachisi boards
constructed of flagstones so that he might play, using beautiful
girls dressed in appropriate colors; or the inclusion of a game
within the Chinese literati’s four key accomplishments in the
arts: mastery of the zither, calligraphy, painting, and weiqi
(perhaps better recognized by its Japanese name: Go); or the
simple modesty of card and board games found at all levels of
society. From a literary perspective, games inflect upon the
playfulness of Dadaism, the linguistic games of the Oulipo, or
even as plot device, as with Scrooge, so taken with the party’s
games “wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was
going on, that his voice made no sound in their ears, he
sometimes came out with his guess quite loud, and very often
guessed quite right, too” (Dickens, A Christmas Carol 69).
The long history of games conspires with the shorter history
of the modern computer game, which both remediates (in Bolter
and Grusin’s sense) previous artistic and ludic forms, while
also taking advantage of the unique feedback mechanisms
afforded by modern computing technology. While sometimes
marked by William Higginbotham's 1958 Tennis for Two,
created at Brookhaven Labs using an analog computer
connected to an oscilloscope, most scholars attribute the first
digital computer game to Steve Russell, who wrote SpaceWar!
on a PDP-1 mainframe computer in 1962. The first text
adventure game, ADVENTURE, was created by William
Crowther and later refined by Don Woods in 1975. Both a game
and a simulation, ADVENTUREwas inspired by the Mammoth
Cave system in Kentucky, which Crowther and his wife
regularly explored. Now, over six million players quest through
the vast reaches of Azeroth in the online multiplayer game
World of Warcraft, while others learn of redemption in the
single-player Prince of Persia trilogy. With an over forty year
history of their own, computer games, their rise, complexity,
and popularity, have reminded us that games – the long history
of games – are perhaps our most understudied form of art and
communication.
The recent prominence of games has led educators and policy
makers to turn (once again) to interactive gaming media as a
way to educate students and influence opinion, resulting in
titles like Darfur is Dying, the language and culture military
education game Tactical Iraqi, the educational game Discover
Babylon, or the social critique of Kinko’s worker in Disaffected.
Taking games seriously requires understanding their
mechanisms, both in order to exploit strategies for successful

Digital Humanities 2007
education but also to provide suitable, knowledgeable critique
of an increasingly prevalent rhetorical platform. Through this
continuous process of understanding these models for interactive
rhetoric, entertainment, and education, scholars also can begin
to build a framework that allows for the preservation for the
many digital media forms that are too slowly finding their way
into our public archival institutions (with a few notable
exceptions).
Games deserve our attention not only because of their potential
in education, and not simply for their role as a cultural, historical
artifact, but also because they are perhaps the
computer-as-medium's most unique art, one that takes the basic
function of computing – interactivity – and refines it into an
expression, a meaningful exchange often articulated by a
challenge between opposing interests. I conclude by providing
one example of how to ‘take games seriously’ as an object of
critical study based on its own merits. I provide an overview
of ‘game fiction,’ which I define as a sub-genre of game that
draws upon and uses narrative strategies to create, maintain,
and lead the user through a fictional environment. The
relationship of computer games to more traditional forms, and
especially narrative, has been a contentious issue within the
growing field of game studies. Understanding games’
indebtedness to and departure from other expressive works,
particularly the narrative forms of prose fiction and film, proves
a delicate challenge. The solution, I argue, stems partly from
creating an understanding of genre within games that addresses
underlying mechanisms as much as subject matter, and moves
beyond the genres that heretofore have been casually outlined.
With the example of ‘game fiction,’ I suggest a framework for
studying games – and for distinguishing types of games that
are all too often lumped together under a singular rubric – that
both draws on existing scholarly practice while also taking into
account the unique computational framework of the modern
computer game.

hile most of us who do humanities computing need no
convincing of its value, academic colleagues - including
those on appointment and promotion panels - still need to be
convinced, and even more so funders. If we want backing for
the use and further development of digital resources, both data
and processes, we need to collect more extensive concrete
evidence of the ways in which they enable us to do research
better, or to do research we would not otherwise be able to do,
or to generate new knowledge in entirely new ways. Since the
value of humanities research as a whole is qualitative, not
quantitative, it is qualitative evidence in particular we should
be looking for: digital resources providing the means not simply
of doing research, but of doing excellent research.
One major task is therefore to accumulate a body of evidence
of what researchers have done, and achieved, with digital
resources— evidence that is not always as easy to find as one
would wish. But what researchers do with these resources is
also dependent on the nature and quality of the resources
themselves: their academic rigour and completeness, and their
technological design. Where a new digital research resource is
created, to what extent does an assessment need to focus on the
methods of analysis, design and construction of the resource,
and to what extent on its usefulness to the community or
communities of researchers? How important are the technical
standards adopted? What about sustainability? What are the
opportunities for re-use and for developing research materials
that can be re-configured in a variety of ways?
Page 183

Digital Humanities 2007
We therefore need not only to accumulate evidence of value,
but to think more about the criteria and methods we should use
for doing so. For instance, where an analytical method is based
on the methods used in other disciplines, e.g. statistics, there
may be methods of assessment that can be likewise borrowed.
Many of us believe the evidence is there, but we do not have
the range of coherent, agreed and tested methods of assessment
that will enable us to make assertions of value that will be
reliable and will carry weight.

Introduction

I

n April of 2007 the TAPoR project, after extended testing
and two public beta versions, released Version 1.0 of the
Text Analysis Portal for Research.1 This portal gathers text
analysis tools configured as web services into an environment
where users can define the texts they want to work with, select
the tools that best work with different text formats, and log
their research. The portal is, on the one hand a broker for piping
electronic texts to tools and then managing the results, and on
the other hand is a study environment where projects can be
managed over time. Our poster will do three things:
•
•
•

Show an overview of how the portal works with annotated
screen shots.
Show the life of the project including the user testing phases.
We will have a laptop in order to demonstrate a live version
of the portal to interested.

rovided we can have a live internet connection we will be
prepared to demonstrate:

How the portal can be used even without an account using
the Try It feature or myLinks pages where users can publish
sets of texts for analysis.
How to get a free account from TAPoR.
How to define texts that may be elsewhere on the internet
or uploaded. How to organize these texts using tags and
how to publish a set of searchable texts for students or
colleagues.
How to use the Workbench to organize a set of texts and
specific tools for a project. How to run tools on texts and
how to save results.

•

How to log the progress of a research project and share it
through TAPoR.

If a live connection is not available we will have a local version
running based on the TAPoR Live CD which is a bootable
version of linux and the portal that works locally.

User Testing and the Life Cycle of a
Tool Project

V

ersion 1.0 of the portal is the result of extensive user
testing which will be visually represented in the poster
as will ways new users can provide us feedback as we develop
the priorities for further releases. 2
For those familiar with earlier versions of the portal there are
a number of improvements including:
•

•

•

•

A new type of news channel called a Research Log. Users
can save results from tools to this log along with comments.
They can also save the text/tool configuration to run again.
A new feature called Analyze Text that will open a window
with the text on the right and suggested tools on the left for
close study of one text.
The myLinks feature has been adapted so users can publish
their public texts for others to search across and for other
to analyze. This can be used, for example, for providing
students with a study set of texts.
The interface has been simplified to make it easy for users
to get projects going.

Background

T

he TAPor Portal is one of the outcomes of a 5 year project
funded by the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI)
that involves 6 universities across Canada, including the
University of Victoria, the University of Alberta, McMaster
University, the University of Toronto, the Université de
Montréal and the University of New Brunswick. Provincial
funding bodies and our respective universities have also
supported the TAPoR project. The portal was developed by
Open Sky Solutions with a team primarily at McMaster
University. The poster will recognize the supporting institutions
but will focus on the portal and not present the wealth of other
projects that are part of TAPoR. 3
This poster will show the current version of a major text analysis
tools development effort that developed a model for sustainable
and modular text analysis for a broad community. This is a
challenge that has concerned computing humanists since the
1980s. As Susan Hockey put it in a post to HUMANIST in
1996 that reported on a meeting she convened at CETH, "For

some time, those of us active in humanities computing have
felt the need for better and/or more widely accessible text
analysis software tools for the humanities. There have been
informal discussions about this at a number of meetings, but
so far no substantial long-term plan has emerged to clarify
exactly what those needs are and to identify what could to be
done to ensure that humanities scholars have readily-available
text analysis tools to serve their computing needs into the next
century."4
The TAPoR model meets a number of the objectives described
for text analysis tools in the 1990s by Hockey and others.5 It
is widely accessible. It provides a long-term model using web
services to bring tools together where they can be used in a
study environment. It allows new tools to be added and existing
tools to be improved or replaced over time as new needs
emerge. It allows research to be recorded and shared.

Future Plans

T

he TAPoR Portal also has limitations. Depending on tools
provided as web services by others increases the chances
of simple operations not working. Many of the tools are not
multi-lingual. The tool broker model where the portal gets a
remote text and passes it to a remote tool is not as efficient as
an all-in-one model where texts can be preindexed. And, as
with any large software project there are still inconsistencies,
awkward interface panels, and bugs.
The poster will conclude by outlining future plans. TAPoR
hopes to be funded for a second phase through the CFI Leading
Edge Fund in order to add large-scale text datamining and
aggregation tools. Currently the portal model does not pre-index
large collections (except in limited cases) and provides limited
aggregation or crawling tools. TAPoR 2, if funded, will continue
improving the interface and will add large-scale functionality
by adapting crawling, scraping and data mining tools to the
study space.

team. Finally, we have a layered testing process combined with
the gathering of tool statistics that is being conducted on the
release.

Recent Developments in the
Music Encoding Initiative
Project: Enhancing Digital
Musicology and Scholarship

Introduction

T

he MEI (Music Encoding Initiative) is an encoding toolset
meant for modeling music information (Roland, 2006).
This does not refer to audio, but to the symbolic representation
of Common Music notation (CMN), the “standard” form of
music notation used between 1700 and 1935 (see Fig. 1). MEI
is an XML application expressed in DTD form (for the present),
with a TEI-like header (Fig. 2), a <music> element instead
of <body>, and <front> and <back> to accommodate text.
The goals for MEI are to encode CMN “out of the box”, to limit
verbosity without compromising the self-documenting aspect
of XML, to support repertoires other than CMN, and to support
creation of multi-lingual interfaces by allowing generic
identifier names to be changed, all to better enable creation of
scholarly editions. In this poster presentation we highlight the
recent developments made to improve and extend MEI with a
special emphasis on the impacts these developments can have
on digital musicology and scholarship.

Recent Developments

M

EI is extending its notation encoding capacity beyond
CMN. While most representations of notation have
been limited to CMN, MEI has a TEI P4-like
extension/restriction mechanism which can be used to expand
the universe of sources to which it can be applied. Work is
progressing in two particular areas: “White mensural” notation
and “Medieval neumatic” notation. Both of these developments
also better situate MEI as an encoding mechanism for serious
digital musicology (see Section 3).
Mensural notation is a musical notation system used from the
later part of the 13th century until about 1600. The name
“mensural” refers to the capacity of this system to notate
complex rhythms with great exactness and flexibility. Mensural
notation was the first system used for European music that
systematically used individual note shapes to denote temporal
durations. Measure-less music requires structural reorganization,
or score-by-staff encoding rather than score-by-measure-by-staff
encoding: the staff must directly allow features previously
available only within <measure>, such as for timed events.
MEI is introducing new concepts to enable such encoding:
events -- ligature, mensuration and proportion signs;
orthographic vs. semantic accidentals; barlines, and new
attributes and attribute values.

Neumes are the basic elements of Western and Eastern systems
of musical notation prior to the invention of five-line staff
notation. Neumatic notation eventually evolved into modern
musical notation, but remains standard in modern editions of
plainchant. MEI is introducing new concepts to enable encoding
of this system: single and compound neumes, ligatures,
mensuration and proportion indicators, orthographic accidentals,
custos, interpretative marks (episema, liquescent neumes,
quilisma) that can be treated as timed events, mora (an
augmentation dot) that may be handled the same as a modern
augmentation dot, and new attributes and attribute values.
MEI is now supporting data collection via MusicXML (Good,
2002), a translator and interchange format for common Western
musical notation from the 17th century onwards. A new 2mei
XSL style sheet facilitates transformation of MusicXML to
MEI, creating an input path from any software that supports
export of MusicXML. On average the resulting MEI files are
only 51% as large as the original MusicXML files.

Enhancing Support for Digital
Musicology and Scholarly Editions

M

EI has been gaining favorable reception among those
engaged in digital music scholarship. For example, the
MeTAMuSe project has said, "In contrast to MusicXML, which
is the de facto industry standard, but which is rather limited in
the representation of musicological concepts such as multiple
divergent sources, MEI has definite advantages in the
musicological context" (Byrd et al., 2006). MEI has also been
described as one of "two really serious contenders" in this
problem space (Kay, 2004).
Digital critical editions of music start with the encoding of the
musical sources, and then add layers for presentation and
meaning. MEI's improved capacity to encode multiple types of
notation, provide support for non-transcriptional text
commentary/annotation, as well as improved methods of data
capture into the encoding format and data export will hopefully
foster new efforts to create scholarly critical editions using
XML. Such content-based encoding modeled on text encoding
formats is not only best-suited to the development of these
digital editions, but can potentially best document the
intellectual process of the development of the corpus, making
the critical work better suited for verification and scholarly
argument.
MEI is well-suited for the creation of scholarly editions that
document the creation and revision history of a single musical
composition. In MEI, a single file supports encoding of the data
common to all sources only once, rather than requiring
redundant markup and encoding in multiple files. The
<source> element holds bibliographic and physical
Page 187

Digital Humanities 2007
description of a single source document and can be linked to
specific data via its data attribute, while data can be linked to
the source via the source attribute, a mechanism not unlike the
“declarable/ declaring” attributes in TEI. When the meiCrit
parameter entity is enabled, parallel alternative encodings are
possible at the score, measure, and staff levels. This feature
would be particularly useful for the construction of such
scholarly editions as the “Online Chopin Variorum Edition”
(<http://www.ocve.org.uk/>). In the case of
manuscript music, the <handlist> element in the header
and the “hand” attribute (available on most music content
elements) allow one to track the scribes, copyists, etc. who
notated the music.
MEI
now
supports
non-transcriptional
text
commentary/annotation. The <annot> element provides a
way to group participating events, the notes that form a
descending bass line, for example, and provide a label for the
group. An editorial or analytical observation, encoded
elsewhere, may be pointed to using the linking attributes.
Alternatively, the observation may be included directly within
the <annot> element.

Ongoing and Future Work

W

ork is progressing to support two modes of visualization
and export. The first is a conversion from MEI to
MusicXML which will allow any software that reads
MusicXML to display/manipulate the data. This is analogous
to the method, i.e., conversion to HTML which is used to
display SGML/XML. This MEI-to-MusicXML conversion, is,
however, lossy. The second mode, direct conversions to other
internal representations, requires writing a filter for each
existing data format. This is a time-consuming task, but will
greatly reduce data loss.
Also, additional elements necessary for manuscript encoding
are planned: <add> (for something added by another person
or at a later date), <del> (for something marked out),
<unclear> (for illegible passages), <damage>(damage to
the carrier), <supplied> (for data supplied by the editor),
and <handshift> to indicate a change in scribal hands.

Abstract

I

n this paper, we discuss how researchers can benefit from
tools that allow them to work with visualizations that rely
on XML data at different levels of granularity. For these
visualizations, we propose using a single interface that draws
on the underlying structural information at both the collection
level and the level of the contents of the individual documents.
We compare two models of this kind of interactivity that are
the subjects of our current interface design and prototyping
activities. One of these systems is predicated on displays relying
on sequence, and the other on visualizing the structure of items
and facilitating their traversal.

Discussion

T

he common goal of these interface systems is to provide
researchers with experimental means of combining
overviews of a document with tools for manipulating the
display. First is our multilevel document visualization system
(Ruecker et al. 2005) that combines three or more simultaneous
displays, including a microtext column showing collection
items, a separate microtext column showing the contents of a
particular document, and a reading view of the document. These
different levels of display are combined with tools for selecting
and manipulating a portion of the text in a subsequent display.
The purpose of the multilevel system is to allow the user to
work with a digital document within the visual context of related
material. We have currently installed it as a feature in the
prototype for watching digital scripts, where the standard
reading view is supplemented with a digital stage that allows
the reader to see both the dynamic text playback and the
blocking of the characters as they move around the stage. We
Page 189

Digital Humanities 2007
are currently carrying out a user study of actors using the system
to learn their lines.
In addition to the dynamic text, we have recently begun to
consider the possibilities of using the microtext columns as
opportunities for providing overviews that can provide further
data. For example, they might be colour-coded and re-organized
according to some useful principle. In the Watching the Script
demo, one form of colour-coding currently available – for plays
that have been encoded in XML that marks the character names
– is to help the reader differentiate between characters.
For purposes of a director planning the play, this overview
allows exploration of the various relationships of the characters
on the stage. It can be use to address questions such as who is
on stage when, and with who, and how many lines does each
actor have? By selectively applying colour only to the character
or characters of interest, and having the remainder display in
regular black text, the director has a tool for studying the entire
play from the perspective of the staging.
Another overview panel in the prototype provides a list of the
characters. As a simple display it does not provide many
affordances, but with the addition of some further information
and the ability to sort, this list also has potential benefits. For
example, if we give the user the opportunity of adding next to
each character the number of lines that character speaks, or a
total of time spent on stage, or both, and then rearranging the
characters according to those numbers, we have another tool
for use in understanding the play at an overview level, and for
planning production. Combined with the blocking tool, these
overviews and their related tools begin to create a tool suite
that we hope will prove useful to actors, directors, and students
of theatre.
The second prototype produces what we are calling a Document
Blueprint: a compact visual representation of the markup in a
document. This blueprint can be used to suggest encoding
particularities of a document by colour-coding tags and
attributes in flexible ways. The identity – and therefore
colour-coding – of sections can be defined in ways that ignore
certain nodes in an XML tree, including elements, attributes,
and text.
Our first application of this system is to generate a document
view where the table of contents is initially displayed in a
legible font size and the markup of sections are displayed in
small, blueprint mode (where visual cues from the text emerge
but the text itself is too small to be legible). The Document
Blueprint system allows the user to define which elements to
toggle between legible and blueprinting modes. Depending on
which elements the user chooses, the system provides a variety
of overviews that can help both in understanding and navigating
the document, much as the conventional table of contents has

Page 190

always done, but with the important differences of dynamic
display and interactivity (Ruecker 2005).

Future Directions

F

or the multilevel display, we are currently working to
extend the affordances of the various overview items. It
may be useful, for instance, to allow the entire surface to be
temporarily subsumed by the overview that currently only
occupies one column. The more complex display would show
the data, still not at a reading view, but at a smaller level of
granularity. Colour-coding and reorganizing this form of display
could prove both interesting and useful.
The document blueprinting project is the youngest of our
prototype projects and will likely evolve the most in the coming
year. We are developing this system in collaboration with the
Orlando Project, which in its next phase will be producing
literary critical material in volume form. The dynamic table of
contents in this case will be used as a navigation aide for readers
interested in browsing through the extended prose of the three
volumes. As has been the case with each of the prototypes, we
will pursue an iterative cycle of design, prototyping, and
development, with user study and experiment at each stage of
the cycle.

Twelve Hamlets: A Stylometric
Analysis of Major Characters'
Idiolects in Three English
Versions and Nine Translations
Jan Rybicki (jrybicki@ap.krakow.pl)
Pedagogical University

F

ollowing my own comparative stylometric analyses of
originals and translations of literary works (Rybicki 2006,
2006a), I have decided to expand the scope of this research to
more than just two languages. This has been made possible by
the fact that Burrows’s well-established method, first used in
his study of Jane Austen (1987), and later developed, evaluated
and applied by a number of scholars, including Hoover (2002),
can be applied to the most frequent words of any text, also in
a language unknown (or less-known) to the researcher. Quite
self-evidently, Shakespeare’s Hamlet was chosen for its status
of a crucial work of English literature and its numerous
translations. The fact that the English Hamlet exists in three
primary versions (First Quarto, Second Quarto, First Folio) was
also a serious incentive.
Character parts were extracted from the three above-mentioned
originals and nine translations: Czech (by Josef Jirí Kolár,
1855), French (François-Victor Hugo, 1863), German (August
Wilhelm Schlegel, 1798), Hungarian (János Arany, 1864),
Italian (Goffredo Raponi, 1999), Polish (ca. 1875), Portuguese
(1966) Russian (Mikhail Morozov, 1954), and Spanish (Leandro
Fernandez de Moratin, 1798). The selection of the translations
was a compromise between their age (the older the better) and
availability in electronic form. The three originals were taken
from the collection of exemplary electronic texts on TACT CD
(1996). Most frequent words were identified in each version,
basing on the rule that a given word was allowed if it appeared
in at least 5 of the major character parts: these included
Claudius, Gertrude, Hamlet, Horatio, Laertes, Ophelia and
Polonius. As a result, the number of the most frequent words
included in the analysis varied from 157 (First Quarto,
obviously the shortest text) to 282 (the Italian translation).
Relative frequencies were then obtained for each character’s
use of each of the above-mentioned words; matrices of the
relative frequencies were then used to produce multidimensional
scaling (MDS) graphs for each version of the play. The same
material was also treated with cluster analysis, usually with
good agreement with MDS.

The following observations have been made:
1. Graphs for each version of the play always included at least
two peripheral data points, invariably including the two
female characters, Gertrude and Ophelia;
2. Laertes and Horatio frequently joined Gertrude and Ophelia
in their peripheral orbits around the data point for Hamlet,
usually central in all graphs (with the notable exception of
the Czech translation);
3. In many translations, the idiolect of Hamlet was more or
less similar to those of some other characters: its closeness
to Polonius (or Corambis) in the First Quarto lessened in
the Second, only to be replaced by a much stronger
similarity to Laertes. An even stronger similitude was
observed between Hamlet, Polonius and Claudius in the
Portuguese translation, or to Claudius alone in the Italian
version. In general, Polonius and Claudius were the idiolects
most consistently similar to that of the main character.
4. The closest similarity of pattern between entire graphs was
that between the First Quarto and Schlegel’s German
translation (Hamlet and Polonius surrounded by even-spaced
peripheral characters);
5. The general pattern was also quite similar between the
Second Quarto and the Folio (peripheral Gertrudes, Horatios
and Ophelias, central Hamlets, other characters in-between);
it was also roughly reproduced in the translations by Arany,
Moratin and Paszkowski.
6. The clearest gender division was observed in the Czech,
Hungarian, and Russian translations.
This introductory study seems to offer several promising
avenues for development. The similarity of pattern between the
Second Quarto and the Folio is not surprising; even less so is
its above-mentioned reproduction by three translations, since
their source material was usually a compilation of the two
original versions. On the other hand, Schlegel’s similarity to
the First Quarto seems pure coincidence, as the so-called “bad
quarto” was discovered more than twenty years after the early
German translation. The peripheral position of female characters
in all graphs is perhaps the most consistent feature of most of
European writing so far analysed with MDS; this effect also
travels very well in translation.
Yet the greatest potential for expanding this study lies in the
sheer number of Hamlet translations. In the languages included
in this study, they are at least five, and very often more than
ten; cultures such as Polish, German, or French, have produced
almost twenty Hamlets each. The inclusion of at least some of
these would provide a fuller picture of patterns of stylistic
differences between Shakespeare’s fundamental play and its
various realisations in other languages.

The Grade project allows authors of complex reference works
to encode documents using familiar features from print
reference works, but, crucially, adds the possibility for the
author to mark where For_‘Dummies’-level information stops
and For_The_Dozen_Living_Experts-level information starts,
plus the relevant stages in between. In turn, readers of Grade
documents are able to switch from ‘Dummies’ mode to Expert
mode at the click of a button. The back-end to all of this is
provided by an XML database. Open-source release of Grade
1.0 is planned to coincide with Digital Humanities 2007.

Rationale

E

xisting grammars of any language are not easy to use and
typically envisage only one kind of user at a time. But a
user may vary in her preferences from moment to moment.
Does she want 'just the rule' right now? Does she want to see
examples, cited in the original language and in translation, and
perhaps print them out? But tomorrow, perhaps, she also wants
the evidence for that rule, or discussion of its problematic status
as a rule?
Any printed reference grammar, even one for a homogeneous
audience, is inevitably a product of compromises. Space devoted
to discussion of different schools of thought detracts from
clarity; space devoted to exceptions detracts from main rules;
space devoted to examples and translations clutters the page,
etcetera. Paradoxically, then, every good grammar is a bad
grammar precisely for the reasons that it is good. A solid
number of sensibly discussed examples coupled with a fair
representation of scholarly opinion on an issue will never fail
to obscure what should be the statement of a simple rule; a
simple statement of a rule, however, will never do justice to
the complexity of the language and needs, at a minimum,
illustrations from actual texts.
An electronic reference grammar, on the other hand, does not
have to make any of these painful choices. What it can offer
instead is the capability for any end user to select, with the click
Page 192

Digital Humanities 2007
of a button, for any part of the syntax, the level of detail he or
she wishes to see at that particular moment, and to switch at
any time to further detail, extra examples, or, conversely, back
to only the main rule, with no exceptions, no examples, and no
translations of examples. If desired, users can choose for
themselves what section to print, and in what format (through
application of XSLT).
Current collections of thematically unified materials, such as
The Perseus project (perseus.tufts.edu) offer user configuration
in the form of cookies, which set a user's default language
(original texts or translations), default font, and the like.
However, Perseus and collections like it derive most of their
power not primarily from this user configurability but from the
intelligent linking of resources that were previously separate:
Words in the texts can be analysed by the morphological parser,
which in turn provides links to the lexicon, which in turn allows
for further word searches, etcetera.
The Perseus texts, then, can be said to 'talk to each other' and
enhance the usability of resources compared to their print
versions: The system is aware, for instance, that a user is reading
Thucydides when she clicks on a word to get a parse or a
meaning; accordingly, the system will highlight Thucydides
citations in any dictionary entry called up. GRADE takes this
configurability one step further in allowing users to retrieve
information customized not just for the text that they are reading
but for the level of complexity that they select.
While traditional rich encoding following, e.g., TEI guidelines
has typically aimed for faithful transcription of an original print
publication, or generally, has aimed to serve the intents of an
author/publisher, the current project uses its XML schema to
allow the end user this flexibility at all times, so that this one
grammar can become, in effect, all grammars to all people. At
the same time, GRADE empowers the author in all the ways
that electronic publishing has started to empower authors, and
then some: a GUI for authoring, the possibility for piecemeal
and immediate publication, as found in blogs and wikis, but
paired with a capacity for richly structured data and full editorial
oversight.
GRADE finds its origin in the second author's need for a
grammar authoring tool, but we submit that the system can be
re-used for many projects that share the characteristics of
complexity and an intended audience with widely varying goals
and levels of expertise. Accordingly, in this demonstration of
the beta version, a second humanities application is offered in
the form of a Latin learners’ vocabulary which is organized in
sets of basic vocabulary and author-specific vocabulary, and
in which database translations from Latin into several languages
can be stored. Users can opt for display of the vocabulary in
Latin and any of these languages, can select particular authors
or genres, can opt for display in flashcard format, etc.

Design Features

G

RADE is written in Perl, chosen for its robustness and
because it is a well-supported Web-centric application
programming framework. GRADE is written in such a way
that even a novice computer programmer can write extensions
that increase its functionality. Two templates (grammars and
vocabularies) will be available in June 2007; tutorials on
extensions are foreseen for Summer 2007.

GUI for XML database

T

he project has a graphical user interface for its XML
database, which allows for entry, update and management
of the objects (grammar sections) and their hierarchical
organization (grammar chapters and smaller sections) in the
database and for their encoding as specific types of information:
text can be marked as examples, translations, notes, levels of
complexity, tables, and lists. Authors can enter text in a standard
browser (Firefox) without having to add in XML tags by hand
(figure 1:editor screen). This makes for convenience for the
authors but also avoids validation problems. The native XML
database backend is based on Sleepycat Software's open-source
Berkeley DB XML 2, provides full support for Unicode UTF-8
and allows queries via XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0. Standard
open-source tools are used throughout, including Apache and
Perl.

Rendering Engine

T

he rendering engine gets objects from the database
(sections of the document) and renders them with XSLT.
Users (that is, readers of the grammar) can browse through
different levels of complexity, choosing to display more or less
information, and what types of information to display, with a
click on 'collapse boxes' or by adjusting their preferences (figure
2: Rendering options).
GRADE supports common Web formats and protocols for
information exchange (XML, XMLRPC, and JSON), so that
another project could potentially even integrate a real-time data
feed (that is to say, up-to-date data rather than a particular
revision which may become obsolete). Alternately, "calling"
programs can also request a specific revision of a document to
ensure its stability.

User registration and privileges

U

sers on the authoring side need administrative privileges
to edit the database (see further below). For non-author
Page 193

Digital Humanities 2007
users, cookies will retain preferences (for display level,
translation display, etc.) during one session. Users may choose
to register in order for preference to be retained beyond sessions.
The user database recognizes different levels of privileges for
users. It permits those with administrative privileges to make
changes to the database at will, subject to hierarchical controls
that prevent changes to sections controlled by higher-order
administrators. A versioning system, at the bottom of the editing
screen, guarantees the integrity of all documents in the system
and permits users to compare prior edits of a given section. In
its final state, GRADE will provide the kind of precise revision
tracking necessary for a rigorous academic project, including
one feature that all existing Wiki software (including
MediaWiki, the software used by Wikipedia) lacks -- the ability
to see, from within a document, who wrote what portions of it
and when.

Figure 1: Editor screen. Note ‘depth level’ 5 next to ‘paragraph’.

What GRADE is not

G

RADE is emphatically not a pedagogy application or
learning management system, a la SCORM from ADL.
It empowers both authors, by allowing them to present richly
coded complex content, and end users, by giving them a flexible
document to use and explore, not by feeding them content
piecemeal or by tracking them. An internet-savvy audience, we
submit, now long-accustomed to browsing hypertexts, should
not be forced into SCORM’s ‘sequencing,’ which aims to have
users experience content in previously specified order.

Conclusion

G

RADE enhances electronic publishing formats in
important ways. It offers an important toolkit for authors
in the Humanities and beyond that will allow them to empower
the readers of their texts and thereby reach wider audiences.
GRADE allows for co-authoring without jettisoning editorial
oversight or losing track of who wrote what; it provides a
powerful tool both for authors in fields in which a rich tradition
of grammatical description already exists, such as many
European languages, as well as for those in need of a tool for
writing the first reference grammar of a language ever to be
published.

The Versioning Machine 3.0:
Lessons in Open Source Software
[Re]Development

The Versioning Machine made its debut at the 2002
ALLC/ACH Conference in Tübingen. It is a software tool for
displaying and comparing multiple versions of texts designed
by a team of programmers, designers, and literary scholars. A
primary goal of the software was to create a display
environment which provides for features traditionally found in
codex-based critical editions – such as annotation and
introductory material – that also takes advantage of
opportunities offered by editing and displaying witnesses in an
electronic environment.
The VM was designed as open source software that would allow
literary editors to concentrate on editing and displaying multiple
versions of text using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), rather
than expecting them to build a custom environment. The
developers deliberately built the tool with JavaScript, CSS, and
XSLT, as these technologies are presumably within the reach
of a humanities scholar if she wanted to alter the environment.
The Versioning Machine is now in its third iteration, and has
been demoed at various humanities computing conferences
over the years. This poster session will not focus on the VM as
a tool per se, but will focus on the issues and lessons learned
developing open source software for the humanities. As this
tool was developed for a very specific goal for a potentially
small community of users, this poster will focus on the issues
raised by developing software for an emerging practice, the
difficulties posed by changing technologies, and the issues
raised by moving from fairly standard book-based presentation
paradigms for scholarly editions, to the relative vacuum of
agreed-upon conventions for web-based editions

Developing Software for an Emerging
Practice

A

t any gathering of digital humanists, there is a plea for
software designed specifically for humanities
applications. The Versioning Machine was developed to fill a
fairly narrow niche. As such, its development has had as a
central focus the exploration of the possibilities, as well as the
limitations, of electronic editions that focus on the presentation
of multiple witnesses.
For the first time in the software's development, rigorous and
methodical usability testing will be carried out by a team
member not directly concerned with software development.
This testing will not only assess user-friendliness, accessibility,
performance, and overall structure, but will also investigate the
larger issue of whether The Versioning Machine functions as
an asset to the community of scholars it is meant to serve. The
test participants will be comprised of 10-15 literary scholars
and textual editors. They will be given a series of tasks to
perform and will be asked to comment on what they are doing
or trying to do. They will also be asked to comment on the
overall difficulty or ease of use, as well as the degree to which
The Versioning Machine has or could enhance their scholarship.
Because many of the participants will not be on-site, a
web-based survey will be used to capture their impressions.
Additionally, a number of participants will be tested on site so
that our observations can be compared with the self-reported
experiences. The resulting findings will be used as a framework
to make further changes to the software.

Difficulties Posed by Changing
Technologies

P

ersistent issues frequently faced in web-based open source
tools development include shifting platforms,
technologies, and standards on which software is constructed;
personnel changes within the development team; and finding
enough time to not only do software development, but create
the documentation and procedures which allow others access.
The difficulties of attempting to adhere to standards, while
ensuring cross-browser compatibility, is one issue that will be
addressed in the poster as representative of these issues.
During the early stages of the tool's development, it was not
possible to replicate the functionality available for browsers on
the PC on the Mac OS operating systems. It was decided to go
live with limited browser support rather delay the software
further. By 2.0, many of the compatibility issues had been
worked out, with support for Mozilla-based browsers and
Apple's Safari. 3.0 focused both on expanding features of The
Page 195

Digital Humanities 2007
Versioning Machine as well as addressing several major
compatibility issues. This involved a significant reworking of
both the XSLT stylesheet and the CSS style rules that power
the tool. Earlier versions were lacking in compliance with W3C
standards, which accounted for a large part of the cross-browser
compatibility issues. A change in personnel meant that several
of the people involved in versions 1.0 and 2.0 were no longer
on the project team. A lack of both comprehensive
documentation and time ensured that, even in its current form,
The Versioning Machine would not correctly validate as
standards-compliant. Thus a pragmatic approach was adopted
in which the most obvious discrepancies were addressed, while
ensuring that all new additions were coded with respect to the
relevant W3C standards.
Of the newly added features, the most significant was the
introduction of optional line numbering, drawn from the TEI
markup of the document. This proved one of the more difficult
features to implement, in large part because of the different
ways that various browsers implement CSS. A presentation
that looked acceptable in Internet Explorer, for example, did
not look acceptable in Firefox or Safari. Toggling line numbers
on and off presented another problem. In this case, the
JavaScript required worked differently on all three browsers.
This was one example of a problem that strict adherence to
W3C standards could not solve. There was more than one
standards-compliant way of achieving similar functionality,
but the difficulty was in finding one method that worked
consistently across multiple platforms.
The ability to directly modify the version 2.0 source code
certainly expedited the design process for version 3.0. On the
other hand, it also meant that we were forced to address many
of the shortcomings of the earlier version as well. Thankfully,
Amit Kumar, who had worked with the earlier version and
implemented the majority of the version 3.0 changes, was able
to provide insight into the workings of the application, and to
bring his experience working with it to bear on the new
compatibility challenges.
As part of the 3.0 redevelopment, a thorough re-evaluation of
the interface was undertaken which would move it toward a
more finished, professional look. A common pitfall of interface
design is that the person designing the interface is often so
familiar with the product that they are unable to view it from
a new user’s perspective. Bringing in a new designer for release
3.0 meant not only a fresh approach to the visual side, but also
a new set of eyes completely unfamiliar with The Versioning
Machine.
Other than the addition of a “backup” menu to the footer, the
interface elements of 3.0 are not significantly different from
release 2.0 — however, their arrangement has been streamlined
for better usability. Even those changes that appear purely
cosmetic have a level of thought behind them. For example,
Page 196

the text in the upper left that said “Versioning Machine” now
spells out the release version of the software. To the left of that
a tagline (“A Tool for Displaying & Comparing Different
Versions of Literary Texts”) has been added to spell out in
broad strokes the software's intended purpose.

What Does an Electronic Scholarly
Edition Look Like?

L

astly, this poster will address some of the theoretical
issues that the developers of The Versioning Machine
have faced in designing an environment to present a web-based
scholarly edition. There is today, ten years after the development
of the World Wide Web, little consensus within the editing
community about the features and standards that should be
required, or at least desired, in these editions. The user testing
on The Versioning Machine to be presented at Digital
Humanities 2007, the ongoing development of the software to
keep apace with standards, and changing user expectations,
will contribute a small piece to that dialogue.

n working across and between disciplines, it is the tacit
assumptions that may be most destructive to meaningful
collaboration. Ours is a state of mutual ignorance, and the goals
and practice of the professional literary historian and the
machine-learning researcher are equally obscure. But in
collaboration mutual ignorance becomes an opportunity for
self-reflection, clarification, and the speaking of what is usually
unspoken. Willard McCarty writes, “Computational form, which
accepts only that which can be told explicitly and precisely”
proves “useful for isolating ... tacit and inchoate” knowledge
(256). Collaborators are forced to set out a program in detail,
one that is mutually comprehensible but also one that delivers
results that are simultaneously meaningful in two disciplines.
In this paper, we discuss the tacit assumptions that accompany
data set preparation, hypothesis testing, and data exploration
in order to deliver prescriptive claims. We propose a
communication protocol designed to bring hidden and tacit
assumptions into plain view where they may be discussed and
analyzed. This paper is the third in a series of collaborative
efforts undertaken by the two authors. It is informed by real
experience working together: working often at cross purposes,
garbling a common language, but ultimately producinresults
that are of interest to both computer scientists and literary
scholars.
Transforming literary content into data for machine learning
methods requires the adoption of a number of initial
assumptions, each of which significantly impacts the final
results. First, the collaborators must select or design an
appropriate data representation. The selection of a bag of words
model may be one such decision, but other feature mappings
such as parse trees or link structure graphs may be more
informative for a given task. Once the textual material is
represented, we must decide upon a method of feature
weighting; that is, we must decide if some features are more
Page 197

Digital Humanities 2007
important than others and how much so. Because many learning
methods prove intractable when working with very large
numbers of features, feature selection is necessary in order to
enable computation. Sophisticated, ambiguous, unstable texts
must be normalized to make comparisons across texts
meaningful—so that the choice of normalization method is
critical. So, too, are methods of noise filtering. There are no
clear objective choices among methods, because each choice
introduces a set of assumptions and biases. We demonstrate
these difficulties with experiments on a range of literary data.
A loose analogy is here drawn as the literary scholar may choose
to cite post-colonial theory to the exclusion of queer theory or
practice close reading to the exclusion of historical analysis.
We do not argue that structuring assumptions be minimized or
eliminated--this is impossible--but we do make the case that in
interdisciplinary work especially, it is important for the impact
of each assumption to be assessed and reported at the outset.
The critic is often a bricoleur, borrowing from literary theory
in promiscuous fashion. In preparing data, bricolage is not a
ready option and the collaborators must make painful
compromises.
The use of machine learning for the testing of literary claims
also has several potential pitfalls. The broadest is the impact
of the No Free Lunch Theorem, which states that there can be
no single machine-learning algorithm that gives optimal
performance on all data sets. The choice of a learning algorithm
entails, again, the adoption of tacit assumptions about the
underlying structure of the data. We may assume that data is
linearly separable (which is often a true assumption in text
classification), or that the data examples are statistically
independent of one another (which is often false in the text
domain). As we demonstrate experimentally, these assumptions
carry significant impact on the results of the data mining. In
the literary domain, selection bias seems particularly
problematic as we navigate the politics of canon formation, the
difficulty of defining of genre, and the vagaries of influence--all
of which trouble the initial selection of texts.
An important question in both machine learning and literature
is that of generalization. Do the results and models we discover
apply only to our particular data set (as in the case of rote
learning), or do these patterns also describe new periods and
genres, data we have not yet investigated? In truth,
machine-learning methods can never guarantee generalization.
However, they do offer statistical bounds on the probability
that a model will generalize. According to the Probably
Approximately Correct paradigm of computational learning
theory, a model that achieves a given level of accuracy on a
training data set will likely achieve a predicted level of accuracy
on a test data set from the same distribution. The computer
scientist emphasizes that generalization bounds are only valid
under assumptions of statistical independence in the training
data. Care must be taken in the literary domain to ensure that
Page 198

probabilistic assumptions are satisfied. Otherwise, the findings
may reflect little more than the selection bias of the investigator.
We provide concrete examples of these issues using data from
literary analysis, and give guidelines for determining when a
generalization assumption may or may not be valid.
The literary scholar often turns to computational methods to
explore large numbers of texts--more texts than one human
could ever read closely. In this last case, the scholar may not
have a hypothesis to test, but is instead looking for new
perspectives on literary history. In a word, the literary scholar
hopes to be surprised by the computer scientist. However,
surprise is too easy a commodity to supply in data mining.
Consider that some of the first literary data miners were the
Dadaists and Surrealists, who produced poetry by cutting a
printed text nto pieces and pulling those pieces randomly from
a bag. In machine learning, this method of textual analysis is
known as Gibbs sampling (Duda), and has been used in recent
work on probabilistic author-topic modeling (Steyvers). This
sort of surprise, however, may not be that which a literary
scholar desires--it may not be a meaningful surprise. Thus, the
scholar must define for the machine-learning specialist exactly
what sort of surprises are desired, so that the appropriate data
mining methods may be applied. This is a curious hermeneutic
circle--the critic worries that requesting a particular kind of
surprise effectively removes true surprise from the process.
Data exploration requires a bound on the unknowns to be
meaningful and productive. We adduce examples of this need
with experiments in anomaly detection on literary data.
Data exploration may be performed by employing data
visualization techniques, or by using unsupervised methods of
machine learning such as clustering. In both of these situations,
it is important to keep the cartographer's dilemma in mind. In
order to understand large data sets in high-dimensional space
both the literary scholar and the computer scientist require some
form of dimensionality reduction. While reductive methods
may, indeed, enable new insights, they may also produce
artifacts--strange islands analogous to the distorted, massive
projection of Greenland on most two-dimensional maps of the
world--that give a distorted view of the underlying structure.
Two specific dangers, then, accompany data exploration. The
first is that a distorted artifact, a picture, may be mistaken for
an underlying truth. The second is that once a data set has been
fully explored, it may no longer be valid to use it for hypothesis
testing. An exhausted data set prompts us to move on to a new
set of texts, to generalize as discussed above. But moving to a
new set of data, we often discover that our hypothesis is not
portable and fails to generalize. The history of literature is a
"collective system," as described by Franco Moretti in Graphs,
Maps, and Trees (4), but law-like generalizations are difficult
to frame and even harder to transport from text collection to
text collection: we discover patterns, yes, and congruent patterns

Digital Humanities 2007
may be discovered in different collections. To say more is to
abandon many of the certainties that the literary scholar had
hoped machine learning would provide him with. In preparing
a data set we construct a system; leaving that data set behind
we leave behind its artificial systematicity as well. Here the
literary scholar is surprised to find the computer scientist a
more thoroughgoing poststructuralist than himself.
It may seem that data mining offers no more claims to
objectivity than literary scholarship -- and indeed, from a certain
perspective, this is the case. At its worst, data mining and
visualization techniques produce mere inkblots that do little
more than manifest the hidden (and indeed, perhaps even
unknown) biases of the researchers. However, these explorations
gain in consequence as the tacit assumptions of both the literary
scholar and the data miner are clearly stated. To assist in
foregrounding assumptions, we propose a protocol for
researchers in these disparate fields. This protocol includes
ways of talking about patterns in a common language, for
defining meaningful data representations, and for selecting
appropriate statistical assumptions. Only when careful
preparatory work is done can data mining have a claim to
meaning in the humanities.

Reading Tools, or Text Analysis
Tools as Objects of
Interpretation

omputer-assisted text analysis has over 50 years of history
in providing tools to help scholars interpret texts (see,
for instance, Potter, 1991, Burrows, 2004, Bradley, 2004). The
tools themselves are the products of a large range of
circumstances in computing and text criticism, from the
availability of certain hardware to the fluctuating fortunes of
structuralist approaches in literary criticism. In this paper we
will reverse the usual interpretive flow from tools to text by
attempting to interpret tools themselves as artifacts of human
creation. We will frame this interpretive exercise as a
Gedankenexperiment; in particular: if a scholar one hundred
years from now were to study the TAPoR Portal as cultural
artifact, what would it reveal about its theoretical
presuppositions, the methodological practices of its times, its
cultural value, and even its authors?
This thought experiment is predicated on the assumption that
tools can be studied as cultural artifacts in ways similar to, say,
literary texts. To examine this assumption more closely, we
will outline several ways in which tools may be studied and
interpreted, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•

as functional systems fulfilling an identified need
as code that corresponds to certain expectations in terms of
structure, brevity, creativity, etc.
as interfaces that may have an aesthetic appeal
as pedagogic tools that are intended to assist users in
developing skills
as artifacts that express an author's perspective
as artifacts that express characteristics about a community

Several differences are evident between literary texts and tools
as objects of study. For instance, tools manifest themselves at
two (at leaset) layers of visibility: the code layer, generally
reserved for developers, and the interface layer, generally
intended for users. Literary texts, in contrast, have only one
layer of exposure. It may also be that text analysis tools are
Page 199

Digital Humanities 2007
fundamentally too different from texts to be considered using
approaches of literary criticism. A similar debate has raged in
game studies for the past several years (see, for instance Frasca,
1999): can games be studied as narratives (the literary camp)
or do they require an entirely different approach (the ludology
camp)? We will argue for a hybrid approach: while literary
criticism can be useful to interpret certain aspects of tools, other
aspects require their own framework of study. Moreover, this
hybrid approach leads to certain practical consequences when
considering how to peer-review tools and their development
(see Sinclair et al., 2003). As a case study for interpreting tools,
we will use the TAPoR Portal, an initiative to build a web-based
gateway to electronic texts and tools (see <http://tapor
.ca/> and Sinclair, 2002). The TAPoR Portal is reaching the
end of its development cycle, after approximately five years.
It serves as a convenient case study for several reasons,
including its duration (a five year project), its collaborative
nature (involving several dozen researchers at five Canadian
universities, its development model (a blend of academic and
private sector contributions), its interdisciplinarity (representing
several branches of the digital humanities and computer
science), and, of course, its size and complexity (over 165, 000
new lines of code). Indeed, given the size of this "corpus",
examples can be found for just about any interpretation that
might be proposed, but such is the open-ended nature of
interpretation.

he editors of a special issue of Signs: Journal of Women
in Culture and Society, a prominent scholarly feminist
journal, wrote in 1990 that “the degree to which American
society has embraced and absorbed computer technologies is
astonishing. The degree to which the changes provoked by
computers leave prevailing inequalities is troubling.”1 This
observation preceded the development of the World Wide Web,
which has enabled computational tools to suffuse much work
of the humanities. The questions that have informed our work
as feminist theorists and scholars—how do our items of
knowledge come into being, who made them, for what purposes,
and how does gender play a role in knowledge making—inhere
in our digital humanities work. That the two fields are or should
be inextricably intertwined seems, therefore, an inevitable fact
of life. But is this just personal coincidence, a fact produced
by the trajectory of our careers and interests? What is
humanities computing anyway, and why should it be important
for feminist cultural, social, and intellectual work?
Concomitantly, can feminism enhance and improve the world
and work of computer science, of humanities computing, of
digital humanities? After all, “very early in life, computing is
claimed as a male territory. At each step from early childhood
through college, computing is both actively claimed as “guy
stuff” by boys and men and passively ceded by girls and
women. The claiming is largely the work of a culture and
society that links interest and success with computers to boys
and men.”2

A culture that says to use computing tools expertly one must
know how machines work, or at least must be deft programmers,
dominates much of the world of humanities computing. It is as
if those who have fretted over literary and other humanities
fields becoming feminized or soft have been rescued by a field
that is hard science. Thus through computing, humanities is
being remasculinized. Scientific matters of mathematics and
computation, objective and hard, are not subject to the concerns
of gender, race, or sexuality. Either explicitly or implicitly,
concerns that had taken over so much academic work in
literature—of gender, race, class, sexuality—were assumed to
be irrelevant to humanities computing. 2 + 2, so the reasoning
goes, always equals 4, whether you are black, female, queer,
or straight. The codes always work, whatever one’s personal
identity or social group, and, as matters of objective and hard
science, are best dealt with by those who have been most
interested in being engineers and computational scientists of
critical inquiry. So surely those interested are also folks who
do not want to clutter sharp, disciplined, methodical philosophy
with considerations of the gender-, race-, and class-determined
facts of life. After all, in the wake of the sixties, the humanities
in general and their standings in particular had suffered,
according to some, from being feminized by these things.
Humanities computing seemed to offer a space free from all
this messiness and a return to objective questions of
representation.
Yet such dreams of a return to the “objective,” uncluttered by
messy identity questions, are nostalgic. That humanities
disciplines were in fact foundationally changed by feminist
scholarship of the twentieth century is obvious from project
development within humanities computing itself, and each of
the panelists is deeply involved with a major digital humanities
project informed by feminist scholarship—the Dickinson
Electronic Archives, The Poetess Archive, The Forget-Me-Not
Hypertextual Archive, a cyberfeminist archive, The Assemblage
Gallery. Our work as feminists leads us to concur with social
scientist Jane Margolis and computer scientist Allan Fisher that
“the goal is not to fit women into computer science [digital
humanities] as it is currently taught and conceived. Rather, a
cultural and curricular revolution is required to change computer
science [digital humanities] so that the valuable contributions
and perspectives of women are respected within the discipline.”3
In other words, this panel will posit ways in which the methods
of feminist, queer, and race critical inquiry might benefit the
work of digital humanists across the board (or screen, as it
were) rather than serving as a special niche of interest (for
example, the methods might benefit the multi-institutional
NORA project, <http://noraproject.org>, and its
second phase, MONK, tremendously).
Descriptions of the roundtable presenters are below and we
trust will serve to show the range of experience and expertise
on which we will draw to pose our questions, posit ways in
Page 201

which the messiness of such critical inquiry can advance digital
humanities, entertain questions and suggestions before, during,
and after our session in order to collaborate with audience
members in knowledge production.

artha Nell Smith is Professor of English and Founding
Director of the Maryland Institute for Technology in
the Humanities (MITH) at the University of Maryland. Author
of more than 40 articles, including “Electronic Scholarly
Editing” in the Blackwell Companion to Digital Humanities,
her publications include Open Me Carefully: Emily Dickinson’s
Intimate Letters to Susan Dickinson, with Ellen Louise Hart

Dickinson Electronic Archives projects at the Institute for
Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH) at the
University of Virginia. With Lara Vetter, she is a general editor
of Emily Dickinson’s Correspondence: A Born-Digital Inquiry,
forthcoming from the Mellon-sponsored University of Virginia
Press Rotunda Electronic Imprint. Her digital humanities work
is an extension of her work as a feminist literary theorist and
scholar. Because her interest in the possibilities afforded by
computers as powerful and empowering tools of humanities
scholarly work became so keen as the World Wide Web was
gaining precedence, her work in humanities computing has
been powerfully influenced by cyberculture and new media
studies. As a digital humanities specialist she has focused on
the sociologies of knowledge production in our
technology-saturated world—what data is reproduced and made
accessible, and to whom, and what new knowledge has been
produced by computational tools. Her questions, suggestions,
and models will be drawn from the multi-institutional data
mining and visualization NORA Project (<http://norap

toward personal media and participatory culture that is a product
(or fallout) of the politicizing of diversity, the women’s
movement, and queer issues. Where notions of interactivity
focused on the technology as the most important component,
participatory or user-generated culture—from wikis to podcasts

Archive Database, which now contains a bibliography of over
4,000 entries for works by and about writers working in and
against the “poetess tradition,” the extraordinarily popular, but
much criticized, flowery poetry written in Britain and America
between 1750 and 1900. Their presentation for this panel will
not be a show-and-tell of these archives, but an in-depth
consideration of ways in which the feminist theories that have
identified the scholarly needs for this resource and informed
their development can advance the work of digital humanities
at large.

Abstract

T

he proliferation of digital collections on the web has
dramatically expanded access to content that would
remain otherwise underutilized or undiscovered. Organizations
that have been actively involved in large scale
digitization—through Google, the Open Content Alliance
(OCA), or other means—most often limit the scope of these
projects to digital replication of materials. Not surprisingly,
given the size and extent of many collections selected for
digitization, the costs of applying extensive research and
scholarship to primary documents are often prohibitive, if such
actions are even considered by project staff. Digital scholarly
editions offer many research advantages that exceed the
limitations of traditional and linear print publications. Their
potential has been already instantiated by a few prominent
projects, among them Rotunda by the University of Virginia
Press and the Perseus Digital Library. 1 Encouraged by these
exemplars, Documenting the American South (DocSouth),
UNC-Chapel Hill Library’s digital publishing program, sought
to create two online scholarly documentary histories: a
collection of documents related to antebellum student life at
Page 203

Digital Humanities 2007
the University of North Carolina and a collection of documents
about the institutional development of the university during the
same period. Through careful planning and analysis,
collaboration with research scholars and subject librarians, and
the application of open-source technology and international
standards, DocSouth's "True and Candid Compositions: The
Lives and Writings of Antebellum Students at the University
of North Carolina" and "The First Century of the First State
University" 2 represent rare examples of scholarly publications
with annotations and interpretive essays that include both color
facsimile and transcription access to unique primary documents.
Documenting the American South has ten years of experience
encoding printed materials using TEI guidelines; however,
creating online documentary histories required a more complex
approach than had previously been employed with our
collections. "True and Candid Compositions", for example,
was originally conceived as a monograph including diplomatic
transcription of manuscript documents; textual, biographical,
and interpretive annotations; several scholarly essays; and an
extensive index—all prepared by Dr. Erika Lindemann,
professor of composition at the UNC-Chapel Hill. In presenting
Lindemann's project on the web, we strove to include all of the
features of her project, plus features only possible through and
valuable for an online publication. [See Figure 1 and Figure 2
for screenshots.]

Application of Technologies

I

n both online publications, we wanted to provide users with
several options to fully explore and discover content in
these unique collections. We offer several "browse by" indices
that were compiled by extracting information from the
TEI-XML files. For "True and Candid Compositions" and for
"The First Century," a total of 500 transcribed manuscript
documents and over 20 scholarly essays were encoded by
graduate students from the English Department and School of
Information and Library Science using "TEI in the Libraries"
recommendations for level 5 of encoding.3 All personal, place,
and organization names were disambiguated by scholars and
assigned a unique id number, a regularized name, and one of
three type descriptors (i.e., person, place, organization). This
information was then encoded within <name> elements with
relevant attributes as part of each document XML file. Images
of all manuscript pages were scanned and saved in TIFF and
JPEG formats.
The XML and image files became input for a publishing
mechanism comprised of two distinct parts: (1) conversion of
XML to XHTML and (2) generation of search and browse
functionality in XHTML pages on the web. [See Figure 3:
Document Processing Workflow.]

Digital Humanities 2007
biographical information contained in an additional XML file
was processed and stored in the same database. A number of
scholars and subject librarians wrote this expansive biographical
information for hundreds of identified and researched proper
names, which has served to add valuable contextual richness
to the collection.

Figure 3: Document Processing Workflow

First, we extracted metadata from each XML file (one XML
file per document) and then converted the XML files to
XHTML. The resulting XHTML files have the distinctive
DocSouth format and include links to images and biographical
annotations, both of which open in separate windows (pop-ups).
This step is accomplished with the use of the XSLT technology,
available from the <teiPublisher> software4, which we modified
to meet our project needs. We used <teiPublisher> with locally
customized XSLT files to transform manuscript and essay XML
files into XHTML files. Our customizations included:
displaying the TEIHeader under tabbed buttons; highlighting
names for which regularized names are viewable as a
mouseover; adding icons to personal names to indicate that
biographical essays are available in pop-up window, and adding
URL links to scanned page images in separate XHTML files.
Second, we generated indices with a custom Java program and
our primary MySQL database, using JAXP/JDBC/XPath
technologies. "XML is a good match for Java. It pairs Java’s
code portability feature with its data portability…"5 The Java
programming language has a number of proven APIs for
working with XML, including the Java API for XML Processing
(JAXP). In concert with XPath and JDBC (Java API for
database interactions), the language is a powerful tool for
performing a variety of operations with XML documents.
Additionally, Java is platform agnostic and secure. We designed
this program to perform a wide range of operations, including:
reporting errors in XML files for quality control; retrieving a
variety of data from XML files; exporting data into the MySQL
database; generating an XHTML file for every page image of
each document; and extracting data from the database to create
indices of personal names, geographic names, organization
names, authors, genres, and topics.
This Java program extracted rich metadata from the XML files,
specifically from the <teiHeader> and from the key, reg,
and type attributes of the <name> element. These varied data
were stored in the primary DocSouth MySQL database, which
contains all the metadata for all DocSouth online collections.
In processing, the Java program extracted all encoded names
and recorded their regularized names, types, and occurrence
locations in the XML files to the database. In a similar process,

We also designed our Java program to generate two types of
"browse by" indices—proper name indices and document
indices. The program generated proper name indices by type;
these indices are hyperlinked to a PHP program that searches
the database and provides a list of documents in which the name
appears. Each linked document displays a document page
highlighting the selected name. Finally, the program uses
available metadata to generate document indices that offer other
chapter-level "browse by" options, including: documents listed
by chapter, topic, genre, and author. As a result of this Java
processing, these two online documentary histories have 2,340
personal names, 170 organization names, and 420 place names
in indices generated from the XML files.
DocSouth's "True and Candid Compositions" and "First
Century" collections represent exciting additions to our digital
library. More than just collections of digitized manuscripts,
these online histories benefit from collaboration with scholars
and DocSouth's considerable experience and technical expertise.
The confluence of unique primary documents, scholarship, and
judicious application of open-source technology solutions
allowed us to develop two online scholarly documentary
histories that far exceed the limitations of traditional print
publications. No longer lost in the archives, these enhanced
digitized primary source materials are readily available to
enthusiasts, scholars, and learners everywhere.

Digital Innovations in Teaching
and Learning: Interactive
Computer Environments in the
Undergraduate Classroom
Lisa M. Snyder (lms@ats.ucla.edu)
University of California, Los Angeles

I

nstructional use of interactive three-dimensional computer
models is transforming undergraduate education at the
University of California, Los Angeles. A surge of faculty
interest in virtual environments over the past ten years has
resulted in a broad spectrum of projects now making their way
into Humanities and Social Sciences classrooms. Art history
and architecture students can now interactively explore the
digital Roman Forum developed by UCLA’s Experiential
Technologies Center (the successor organization to the Cultural
Virtual Reality Lab) in place of filmic slides or PowerPoint
presentations. Near Eastern Languages and Cultures students
can tour through Qumran, the settlement associated with the
Dead Sea Scrolls, in a computer reconstruction developed by
the Qumran Virtual Reality Project, or compare the first century
Herodian Temple Mount with the eighth century Umayyad
structures on the site through the real-time visual simulation
model developed jointly by the Urban Simulation Team at
UCLA and the Israel Antiquities Authority. Archaeology
students can experience the ancient Egyptian sites of Karanis
and Karnak created with support from UCLA’s Office of
Instructional Development and Academic Technology Services.
Spanish and Portuguese students can culminate their studies of
the pilgrimage route in Spain with a virtual visit to the
Romanesque Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, complete
with authentic period music. In American History classrooms,
students can experience the wonders of the World’s Columbian
Exposition of 1893 by interacting with a model developed by
the Urban Simulation Team.
The proposed paper will describe the results of over 600 student
surveys administered in the past two years by the UCLA
Experiential Technologies Center (ETC) staff to solicit reactions
to this new form of instructional technology. The survey
instruments were completed following regularly scheduled
class meetings held either in a technology-enabled classroom
or UCLA’s Visualization Portal (a campus facility with a 160
degree spherically wrapped projection screen specifically
designed for displaying these virtual environments). In the
surveys, Likert-style ratings gauged the students’ overall
Page 206

experience with the computer model, their understanding and
interest in the content of the virtual environment, and their
reactions to the technology as a learning tool and compared to
more traditional types of instructional technologies. Multiple
choice and ranking questions explored the students’ interest in
using the virtual environments outside of the classroom and
the aspects of the environment most important for creating an
engaging learning experience. Short answer questions delved
into the students’ likes and dislikes, and thoughts on the learning
benefits of interactive computer models.
The paper will also explore instructor reactions to the classroom
use of interactive computer models. Concurrent with the student
surveys, ETC staff administered instructional technology
questionnaires to twenty five undergraduate instructors from
around the country who participated in an NEH Summer
Institute focused on “Models of Ancient Rome” and conducted
personal interviews with twelve instructors actively using the
models in their classrooms to explore faculty reactions to
teaching with virtual environments. The results of these surveys
identify the perceived challenges and benefits to classroom use
of interactive computer environments, general concerns about
instructional technology, curricular integration, perceived and
experienced pedagogical impacts, and instructor expectations
for virtual environments.
The paper will conclude with an analysis of how the student
and instructor reactions to the UCLA environments are
informing ongoing project development, and a discussion of
future research regarding digital pedagogy in the Humanities.

Scholarly (R)evolution: Roles of
E-texts in the Research Process
in the Humanities
Suzana Sukovic (suzana.sukovic@uts.edu.au)
University of Technology, Sydney

Introduction

T

he study on the roles of electronic texts (e-texts) in the
research process in the humanities investigates how
academics in literary and historical studies work with electronic
textual resources and how interaction with electronic texts
affects their research processes. It is situated in the context of
discussions about the cultural revolution triggered by the
development of digital media. The common comparison with
the print revolution suggests that textual sources are at the centre
of the change, which is particularly significant for scholars in
the humanities. Since text is the basic working material for
research in the humanities, the provision of text in an adequate
electronic form is crucial for qualitatively new applications of
computer technology in humanistic disciplines. At the same
time, an understanding of scholars’ interactions with e-texts is
critical for decisions on how to present existing sources and
for any work on further developments.
In his seminal book, Radiant Textuality, Jerome McGann talks
about the ‘material revolution’ in which we reconceive the
entity of our cultural archive of materials. Since these
repositories provide the basis for all traditional scholarly work,
institutional changes have been having a radical effect on the
traditional scholarship (McGann 2001). The acceptance of
digital resources in the humanities has not been as clear and as
decisive as in sciences, but reports from different countries over
the last few years point to a positive shift in the quantity and
quality of scholars’ engagement with information and
communication technologies (Houghton, Steele, and Henty
2003; The British Academy 2005; American Council of Learned
Societies 2006)
A range of studies explored the information behaviour of the
humanities scholar; some were focused on the use of digital
resources in the humanities but none dealt primarily with the
use of electronic texts. Several studies have been conducted,
dealing briefly with the use of electronic texts as part of a
broader investigation (Massey-Burzio 1999; Brockman et al.
2001) or surveying the use of a particular electronic resource

(Flanders 1998; Porter 1998; Duff and Cherry 2000; Cherry
and Duff 2002). The literature suggests that electronic texts,
while much appreciated by those who use them, have not
become widely accepted, even in disciplines that are heavily
based on textual studies (Warwick 1999; Brockman et al. 2001).
Studies of citation patterns, such as Graham’s investigation of
citations in historians’ professional publications, show that
electronic resources do not rate highly in published works
(Graham 2000, 2001). However, citation patterns may indicate
intellectual exchanges to some extent, but they are not an
accurate reflection of the use of electronic resources. Palmer
(2005) points out that there are scholars who have begun to
create digital resources for themselves, which is one of the
indications of how scholars wish to engage new technologies
in their research.
There is a gap in our knowledge about the roles of electronic
texts in the research process so we need to explore various
aspects of scholars’ interactions with e-texts and explain how
these interactions contribute to the research process.

Methodology

T

he exploratory study on the roles of electronic text in the
research enquiry used qualitative methodology to
investigate research projects in which e-texts have been used
and the nature of academics’ interactions with these texts. The
following research questions guided the development of the
study:
1. How do academic researchers in literary and historical
studies work with electronic texts?
•
•

How and for what purposes do researchers interact with
electronic texts?
How do researchers think and feel about the research
context in which they work with e-texts?

2. How are the interactions with e-texts integrated in the
research process?
3. What is the contribution of e-texts to the research process?
4. What are the obstacles and aids in engagement with
electronic texts?
The study has dealt with the use of electronic texts as a resource
and tool, as opposed to projects that aim to produce electronic
textual editions or enhance electronic texts in any way. The
participants saw their work as traditional humanities research
or discussed their projects aiming to have traditional outputs.
Investigated research projects were in the areas of literary and
historical studies, because both fields are known for extensive
and sophisticated use of textual resources. Participants from
six universities in two Australian cities and one participant from
Page 207

Digital Humanities 2007
a university in the USA (altogether 16 participants) participated
in the study and discussed thirty research projects.
The term ‘electronic text’ in this study means any textual
material in electronic form, used as a primary source in literary
and historical studies. Primary materials are usually poetry,
stories, novels, plays, and a variety of historical documents —
government, public or private. Digitised archival copies of
magazines and newspapers, as well as web-sites and blogs,
could be electronic texts as defined here when they are used as
primary sources. Electronic texts could be written or spoken
(e.g., oral histories), digitised or created electronically,
stand-alone documents or part of electronic databases and
editions.
The study has had two phases. The first phase included in-depth
semi-structured interviews, examination of participants’
manuscripts and published works as well as examination of
some e-texts they mentioned during interviews. The second
phase involved detailed data-gathering from a small group of
academics drawn from the participants in the first phase. The
grounded theory techniques described by Strauss (1987), Strauss
and Corbin (1998a; 1998b) and Glaser (1998) were used for
data analysis.

Roles of e-texts

T

his paper presents findings directly related to roles of
e-texts in the research process but the understanding of
the roles is based on other findings that emerged from the study.
Firstly, scholars in the study perceived e-texts as fluid entities,
which combine different media and formats in a way that does
not match the traditional divisions of library materials. The
perceived fluidity of electronic textuality leads to converging
and transformed practices of networking and information
searching. These practices combine aspects of networking,
chaining, browsing and web-surfing in traditional and new ways
so that the pattern of a new information behaviour emerges. I
called this new practice netchaining (Sukovic 2006).
The roles of e-texts are based to a large extent on working with
e-texts as fluid entities. Four main roles of e-texts in the research
process emerged from the study.
1. Support in finding documents and information. Search
capabilities combined with the provision of full text documents
provide a powerful aid in information discovery. E-texts provide
support in information retrieval and discovery of primary
materials; they lead to other sources and aid in working with
analogue sources; supplement hard copies and contribute to the
current awareness.
This is the most fundamental role. Not only do information
discovery and retrieval provide a basis for all other roles, but
Page 208

the nature of scholars’ interaction with e-texts during the
retrieval determines other roles to a large extent (Role 3, for
example).
2. Aid in managing the research process. Access to e-texts
allows scholars to plan visits to remote collections; aids the
publication process and provides sources for some research
activities (e.g., ordering digital images, confirming publication
rights, and exchanging files with collaborators and publishers).
3. Aid in investigation of the topic. The multiplicity of sources,
formats and textual information that could be quickly brought
together is a basis of exploration that allows scholars to see
different meanings and aspects of the topic. Exploration of
research questions through interactions with e-texts took four
main forms:
•
•
•
•

exploration of patterns and connections by searching and
comparing diverse bodies of electronic texts;
production and/or interrogation of textual databases to
explore research questions;
exploration of electronically born literature and
exploration as part of the academic research to be used in
creative.

4. Contribution to writing and presenting research results. The
use of e-texts improves the speed and accuracy in writing by
allowing copying and pasting of passages. Interactions with
e-texts and digital media in general promote new, less structured
and linear ways of thinking about the topic, which influences
the academic writing style. From subtle changes in presenting
the argument to more radical combinations of academic and
creative writing styles, the participants reflected on different
ways in which electronic textuality was influencing their
traditional academic writing. Interactions with e-texts also
encourage thinking about alternative modes for presenting
research findings that do not fit traditional academic genres.
E-texts contribute to the final research stages in a complex
process of negotiation with the research tradition.
These roles serve two main functions:
•
•

aid in providing basis for research (support roles) or
aid in exploring the topic and presenting research findings
(substantive roles).

E-texts provide basis for research, or play support roles, when
they make some aspects of the research process quicker and
easier. The speed and convenience, or frustration sometimes
associated with working with electronic sources, may influence
the process, but they normally do not affect the scholar’s
intellectual engagement with the topic in a significant way. The
first two roles, Support in finding information and Aid in
managing research process, are support roles. The fourth,
Contribution to writing and presenting research results, plays

Digital Humanities 2007
a support role when e-texts help in improving the speed and
accuracy.
E-texts aid in exploring the topic and presenting research
findings, or play substantive roles, when they take part in
shaping the scholar’s thinking process. Interactivity is an
essential element in following hunches, testing hypotheses and
making connections in a way that was impossible or impractical
without e-texts. The scholar’s thinking about the topic develops
in the interplay with the e-text and this experience can influence
the presentation of research results. The third role, Aid in
investigation of the topic, is a substantive content-oriented role.
In Contribution to writing and presenting research results,
e-texts have a substantive role when they influence the writing
style and presentation of research results.

Conclusion

U

nderstanding of the roles of e-texts in the research process
contributes to our understanding of the envisaged
scholarly change as well as information needs and behaviour
in the humanities. It confirms the recent reports on the change
of research practices resulting from the use of ICTs and explores
the impacts of interactions with e-texts on the research process.
The study can have practical implications for the development
of digital collections and software applications, approaches to
text encoding and development of training programs and
institutional policies.

A Statistical Study of
Superlatives in Dickens and
Smollett: A Case Study in Corpus
Stylistics
Tomoji Tabata (tabata@lang.osaka-u.ac.jp)
University of Osaka

1. Introduction

T

his study gives a quantitative overview of the use of
superlatives in Dickens in comparison with Smollett. The
focus is laid on the differing distribution of superlatives in the
texts written by the two authors. By applying correspondence
analysis, this study tries to illustrate how sharply the two authors
differ in their uses of superlatives as well as how texts are
clustered according to chronology within authorial sets.
Despite a number of studies on Dickens’ style have noted a
tendency for overstatement in his fiction (Brook 1970; Sorensen
1985; Golding 1985; Hori 2004, etc.), surprisingly little
attention has been paid to superlatives as a whole. Apart from
Dickens studies, however, Biber et al. (1999) gives an
interesting account of superlatives in four linguistic registers:
conversation, fiction, news, and academic prose. According to
Biber et al., —est superlative adjectives are most frequent in
news reportage (c. 1400 times per million words) while “the
comparatively low frequency of superlatives in academic
writing (c. 800 per million) reflects a general reluctance to make
extreme claims” (Biber et al., 521), with fiction showing even
lower frequency for the word class (c. 700 per million).

Page 210

Digital Humanities 2007
texts as well as tokens is inevitable. However, due attention
will be paid in the choice of variables to minimize a potential
effect of the differences in the population of the two sets.

2. Quantitative approaches to
style/register variation

M

Table 1

Dickens and Smollett stand in contrast in the frequency of
superlative forms. In Dickens’ 23 texts used in this study, the
number of tokens for superlatives amounts to 4,960, whereas
Smollett employs them 634 times in his seven works. In the
normalised frequency scale per million words, the frequency
in Dickens is nearly twice as high as in Smollett: 1,049 versus
568.

Table 2

With regard to the number of types, 423 different superlative
forms are found in total. Among those, a few types are highly
frequent such as, most, best, and least, occurring more than one
thousand times. Conversely, more than one third of the whole
types occur only once. Such hapax legomena include unique
words, such as, superlativest and unfortunatest.
This study deals with a corpus of texts comprising Dickens’
and Smollett’s major works. Dickens’ set includes fifteen "serial
fictions", six "sketches", one "miscellany", and one "history".
Smollett’s contains six "fictions" and one "sketch". The total
word-tokens in the corpus amount to 5.8 million, with the
Dickens component containing 4.7 million tokens and the
Smollett component totalling 1.1 million word-tokens. The
present project was initiated as a study based on a
comprehensive collection, not a sample corpus, of texts by the
targeted authors. Therefore, the imbalance in the number of

ilic (1967) is among the earliest successful specimens
of a quantitative description of style. He compared the
style of Jonathan Swift with the writings of his contemporaries,
with special reference to the relative frequencies of word-classes
in the texts and to grammatical features such as seriation and
connection. Cluett (1971 & 1976) adopted a similar approach
to conduct a diachronic study of prose style across 4 centuries:
from 16th to 20th Centuries. Brainerd’s works (1979 & 1980)
are ambitious attempts to apply discriminant analysis to the
question of genre and chronology in Shakespeare plays.
Takefuta’s (1981) approach to text typology, or register
variation, is among the first to successfully employ factor/cluster
analysis to the lexical differences between registers. His
pioneering work, however, is not widely acknowledged because
it was written in Japanese.
Since Burrows (1987) and Biber (1988), it has become popular
practice to employ multivariate techniques in quantitative
studies of texts. Biber carried out factor analysis (FA) on 67
linguistic features to identify co-occurring linguistic features
that account for dimensions of register variation. A series of
research based on Biber’s Multi- Feature/Multi-Dimensional
approach have been successful in elucidating many interesting
aspects of linguistic variation, such as diachronic change of
prose style, variation within a single author, and differences
between conversational styles in British and American English,
to give a few examples (Biber & Finegan 1992;
Opas-Ha nninen 1996, Watson 1997, Conrad & Bibereds.
2001)
The Biber model is one of the most sophisticated approaches
by far. Yet it is not without its critics. Nakamura (1995) raises
a major objection. He argues that Biber’s variables are “quite
arbitrarily selected with no definite criterion and mixed levels”
(1995: 77-86). Further, Sigley (1997) notes that almost half of
Biber’s 67 linguistic features are too rare in texts of 2,000
words.
Burrows (1987), on the other hand, applied a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) to the thirty most common words
in the language of Jane Austen. The method demonstrates that
differing frequency patterns in these very common words show
significant differentiations among Austen’s characters, and that
the statistical analysis of literary style may lead not only to a
deeper understanding of the novel itself but may also contribute
to our deeper appreciation of it. In this use of a PCA, the
Page 211

Digital Humanities 2007
frequencies of common words are used as variables. The
Burrows method seems to have higher replicability and
feasibility; since it focuses on common words, most of the
variables are frequent enough to produce stable statistical
results. In addition, it does not require a multi-layered tagging
scheme optimised for Biber’s MF/MD approach.
A particular strength of the Burrows methodology is in testing
cases of disputed authorship and national differences in the
English first-person retrospective narrative, known as ‘history’.
Among the most successful applications are Burrows (1989,
1992 & 1996), Craig (1999a, b, & c). The Burrows approach
or similar methodology has been applied to Bible stylometry.
Some scholars like Linmans (1998), Merriam (1998), and
Mealand (1999) use Correspondence Analysis (CA) instead of
PCA. In the context of text typology, Nakamura (1993) applied
CA to the frequency distribution of personal pronouns to
visualize association between personal pronouns and 15 text
categories in the LOB corpus.

frequency scores

4. Results
3. Methodology

T

he present study is different from the Biber and Burrows
models in that it extends the range of variables to include
low-frequency words, or rare words, by applying CA in the
analysis of superlatives. CA is one of the techniques for
data-reduction alongside PCA and FA. CA allows examination
of the complex interrelationships between row cases (i.e., texts),
interrelationships between column variables (i.e., words), and
association between the row cases and column variables
graphically in a multi-dimensional space. It computes the row
coordinates (word scores) and column coordinates (text scores)
in a way that permutes the original data matrix so that the
correlation between the word variables and text profiles are
maximized. In a permuted data matrix, adverbs with a similar
pattern of distribution make the closest neighbours, and so do
texts of similar profile. When the row/column scores are
projected in multi-dimensional charts, relative distance between
variable entries indicates affinity, similarity, association, or
otherwise between them. One advantage CA has over PCA and
FA is that PCA and FA cannot be computed on a rectangular
matrix where the number of columns exceeds the number of
rows, a concern of the present study. Yet CA can handle such
types of a data table with, for example, the row cases consisting
of thirty texts and the column variables consisting of hundreds
of words.

F

igures 1 and 2 demonstrate a result of CA based on 242
superlative forms across 30 texts. The solution given as
Dimension 1, the most powerful axis, allows quite
straightforward interpretation: the horizontal axis of Figure 1
distinguishes between the Dickens and the Smollett sets. It is
also interesting that the early Dickensian texts, such as Sketches
by Boz, Pickwick Papers, and Nicholas Nickleby, are among
the closest to Smollett’s texts along the horizontal axis.

The Dickens corpus is more than four times the size of the
Smollett corpus, and the number of types used by Dickens is
nearly four times as many as those used by Smollett (see Table
2). It is necessary to ensure that a size factor does not come
into play in the outcome of analysis. Figures 3 and 4 are derived
from 105 superlatives common to both authors. Despite the
decrease in the number of variables from 242 to 105, the
configuration of texts and words is remarkably similar to that
based on 242 items. Of further interest is that, in each of the
two authors’ sets, early works tend to have lower scores with
later works scoring higher along Dimension 2.
Such result seems to illustrate how the authorial difference and
chronology are reflected in the frequency pattern of superlatives
in the texts written by Dickens and Smollett. This study might
suggest the effectiveness of the stylo-statistical approach based
on correspondence analysis of texts.

Researching e-Science Analysis
of Census Holdings: The ReACH
project

e

-Science technologies have the potential to enable
large-scale datasets to be searched analysed, and shared
quickly, efficiently, and in complex and novel ways. So far,
little application has been made of the processing power of grid
technologies to humanities data, due to lack of available large
scale datasets which would warrant such high performance
computing, and little understanding of or access to e-Science
technologies. The ReACH workshop series, funded by the UK’s
Arts and Humanities Research Council, was established in June
2006 at University College London to investigate the potential
application of e-Science and high performance computing
technologies to a large dataset of interest to historians,
humanists, digital consumers, and the general public: historical
census records.
The ReACH series consisted of various workshops undertaken
over the summer of 2006 to investigate the academic, technical,
and managerial aspects that would have to be taken into account
in order to set up a large scale project which would utilise
UCL’s high performance computing facilities to analyse large
scale historical census datasets from the UK’s National
Archives, in conjunction with the genealogy firm, Ancestry.
By undertaking a scoping study in this manner, it was hoped
to determine the academic merits of such a proposal: it may be
feasible to undertake this analysis, but would it be useful to
historical researchers? What would the analysis do? What would
the technical implementation of such a project involve? What
staffing and funding costs would be required? The workshop
series featured input from various project partners, and
interdisciplinary experts, to ascertain whether a full scale project
would be worthwhile to undertake. Moreover, the workshop
series aimed to ascertain if and how e-Science (defined as “a
specific set of advanced technologies for Internet
resource-sharing and collaboration: so-called grid technologies,
and technologies integrated with them, for instance for
authentication, data-mining and visualization. (AHRC ICT
2006)”) can be applied to the arts and humanities.
Public interest in historical census data is phenomenal, as the
overwhelming response to mounting the 1901 census online at

The National Archives demonstrates (Inman, 2002). Yet the
data is also much used for research by historians (see Higgs
2005 for an introduction). There are many versions of historical
census datasets available, covering a variety of aspect of the
census, and digitised census records are one of the largest digital
datasets available in arts and humanities research. In the Arts
and Humanities Data Service repository collection alone there
are currently 155 datasets pertaining to historical census data
(from the UK and abroad) created for research purposes (AHDS
2006). Commercial firms dealing (or having dealt) in genealogy
information (such as Ancestry1, Genes Re-united2, QinetiQ 3,
British Origins4, The Genealogist5, and 1837Online6 ) have
digitised vast swathes of historical census material (although
to varying degrees of completeness and accuracy). There is
much interest from the historical community in using this
emerging data for research, and developing tools and
computational architectures which can aid historians in
analysing this complex data (see Crocket, Jones and Schürer
(2006) for an advanced proposal regarding the creation of a
longitudinal database of English individuals and households
from 1851 to 1901, see also the work of the North Atlantic
Population Project7). However, there have been few
opportunities for the application of high performance computing
to utilise large scale processing power in the analysis of
historical census material, especially analysing data across the
spectrum of census years available in the UK (7 different
censuses taken at 10 year intervals from 1841-1901). Although
certain digitized datasets of the UK census are in the public
domain (18818) most were digitized by commercial companies
and are unavailable to the academic researcher. Most historians
do not have access to, or do not know how to use, high
performance computing facilities.
The aim of the ReACH series was to bring together disparate
expertise in Computing Science, Archives, Genealogy, History,
and Humanities Computing, to discuss how e-science scale
techniques could be applied to be of use in the historical
research community. The project partners each brought various
expertise and input to the project:
•

•

•

UCL School of Library, Archives and Information Studies9,
who have expertise in digital humanities and advanced
computational techniques, as well as digital records
management,
The National Archives10, who select, preserve and provide
access to, and advice on, historical records, e.g. the censuses
of England and Wales 1841-1901 (and also the Isle of Man,
Channel Islands and Royal Navy censuses)
Ancestry.co.uk11, who own a massive dataset of census
holdings worldwide, and who have digitized the censuses
of England and Wales under license from The National
Archives. The input of Ancestry was central to this research
to gain access to the complete range of UK census years in
digital format.
Page 215

Digital Humanities 2007
•

UCL Research Computing12, the UK's Centre for Excellence
in networked computing, who have extensive high
performance computing facilities available for use in
research.

The project aimed to investigate the reuse of pre-digitised
census data: presuming there was not funding available to be
in the business of digitisation of other record data for any pilot
project. The project also wished to investigate the use of
commercial datasets (as many of the large census data sets are
owned by commercial firms: in this case, Ancestry), and the
licensing and managerial issues this would raise for future
projects. The project also wanted to establish how feasible, and
indeed useful, undertaking such an analysis of historical census
data would be.
The results of the well attended workshop series was a sketch
for a potential project, and recommendations regarding the
implementation of e-science (high performance computing)
technologies in this area. However, at this time, it was not
thought possible to pursue the potential project at this time in
the following e-Science call which emanated from the AHRC
in October 2006 due to a variety of reasons which are elucidated
in this paper. Reasons for not taking the project forward at this
time were not technical or managerial, but historical: it will be
a few years before all the digitized data required to make this
project a success will be available (or be of high enough quality,
see Holmes 2006). Nevertheless, the scoping nature of this
project did highlight interesting aspects of the application of
high performance computing to humanities data: discussing
the nature, size and quality of humanities datasets (as opposed
to scientific datasets), and managerial and technical expertise
in data management, security, and licensing. Importantly, the
nature of working with a commercial company on their sensitive
data was also explored from a legal aspect, highlighting issues
regarding use and reuse of digital data for the arts and
humanities: who “owns” resulting datasets from collaborative
projects?
This paper describes the methodology of the workshops,
reporting on suggestions made during the series regarding
potential applications of high performance computing which
would benefit academic historians, sketching out a future project
regarding how historical census material can be analysed
utilising high performance computing, and extrapolates
recommendations that can be applied in general to the use of
e-Science and high performance computing in the arts and
humanities research sectors.

M

useums have been exploring the use of multi-user
virtual environments (MUVE) for more than a decade,
often in the form of proprietary virtual worlds built for select
audiences such as teachers and students. Since launching in
2003, the online virtual community of Second Life (<http:
//www.secondlife.com>) has attracted over one million
dedicated 'residents' who are laying the foundations for
widespread adoption of MUVE. In many ways, the growth of
MUVE mirrors the growth of the Web. New technologies
transition from small scale prototypes constructed by researchers
at great expense to large scale, rapidly growing mainstream
products and services available to the general public. These
products are not only used by many people, but are co-created
by them. With the Web this was a matter of using hypertext to
create websites, initially inspired by various genres of print
media, and soon evolving their own genres. In the case of
MUVE like Second Life (SL), residents can create 3D artifacts,
buildings, and social spaces where people interact. The social
nature of Second Life is a critical component of understanding
how it is, can, and should be used.
Already we can see a wide range of museum-like activities
occurring in Second Life. A recent survey identified over 150
museums, galleries or museum-like activity spaces in Second
Life. These museums offered visitors opportunities to view
collections of real-life and fictional spacecraft, digitized
versions of real-life artworks, exhibitions of artworks created
in Second Life, living history reenactments, or archaeological
monuments (Urban, Marty & Twidale, 2007). Reflecting the
patterns of development of the early World Wide Web, most
Page 218

of these SL museum spaces have been created by enthusiasts
- residents who are not affiliated with real-life museums.
Game studies researchers have suggested that the behaviors of
players in other massively multi-player online games (MMOG)
such as World of Warcraft are blurring the boundaries between
work, play and learning (Castronova, 2006; Steinkuehler &
Williams, 2006; Yee, 2006). Like other passionate user
communities, Second Life residents are turning the virtual world
into a 'third place' where they can engage in serious leisure
pursuits. Museums and cultural heritage institutions are not
unfamiliar with serious leisure as they often engage with
amateur archaeologists, natural scientists, living-history
re-enactors or family historians. Unlike traditional museum
audiences, these individuals are "involved participants rather
than consumers" (Orr, 2006; Stebbins, 1992).
The degree to which individual residents decide to place
themselves on a continuum from pure work to pure play can
affect the results of their activities in Second Life. Some
residents seek to evoke a particular historic place, while others
engage in the serious work of conducting research, visiting the
real-life places and artifacts upon which their Second Life
representations are based. Some residents see Second Life as
primarily a social space that requires a lower degree of
authenticity and accuracy. As long as the stage can provide the
necessary background, it can facilitate social interactions
(DiBlas, 2005). Other residents are using Second Life as a new
expressive medium that allows them to create new artworks or
to accurately represent cultural artifacts as best they can.
As residents create museum-like activities, humanities scholars
are exploring Second Life as a virtual classroom. The New
Media Consortium (<http://www.nmc.org/sl/>) has
constructed a virtual campus where classes are held in "outdoor"
amphitheaters, faculty and students are staging plays, poetry
readings and providing space for digital artists to create new
works. The Stanford Humanities Lab (<http://shl.sta
nford.edu/>), the Humanities, Arts, Science and
Technology Advanced Collaboratory (HASTAC - <http:/
/www.hastac.org/>) have also staked some ground in
Second Life.
Observations of how Second Life residents are currently
engaging in serious leisure activities around museums and
archaeological models can inform many kinds of research. We
can study the early stages of a new online social medium being
co-created and evolving into a new form, just as the early days
of the web led to the development of new forms of creating,
sharing and manipulating information, including cultural
materials. We can also use the work of these technological
pioneers to inform ways to create new learning spaces for
students. Second Life also affords researchers and students an
opportunity to demonstrate what is possible when more rigorous
methods are applied. While many projects have created models

Digital Humanities 2007
using highly accurate rendering systems, Second Life can add
value to this work by providing tools for social engagement for
a broader audience (Di Blas, 2003, 2005; Eiteljorg, 2004). The
serious leisure activities of Second Life residents also suggest
a more open and inquiry based approach to learning. Instead
of presenting students with already completed models, Second
Life can engage students through co-creation and collaborative
discovery.
This poster will present examples of museum-like spaces and
activities taking place in Second Life with a particular focus
on archeological-themed representations. It will illustrate how
Second Life museums are largely the product of resident’s
serious leisure activities. Using these activities as an example
of what is possible it will explore how early attempts at teaching
in Second Life might be informed by resident’s serious leisure
activities.

I

t is often stated by critics that the Quixote is a theatrical,
graphic, and visual book. Thus, visual representations, like

Page 220

theatrical performances, popular iconography and book
illustrations, have been recognized as significant contributions
to the understanding of Cervantes’ masterpiece.1 2 Nevertheless,
the thousands of woodcuts, engravings, etchings, drawings,
and lithographs that have accompanied the text are, for the most
part, a little known interpretative tradition, and a much neglected
critical and artistic treasure.3
Obstacles, such as the difficulty of accessing rare books, have
prevented the illustrative tradition from being appreciated by
scholars, students, and users in general. In 2001 the Cervantes
Project (CP) started the creation of a hypertextual archive to
include digital images of the illustrations taken from over 500
of the most significant editions to form the textual iconography
of the Quixote (as permitted by copyright limitations). Our
main objectives are to make the illustrations more accessible
and to establish their contribution to the reception and
interpretation of the text. At the present time, the archive has
digitized, and made available online more than 7,000 images,
supported by a fully searchable database and complemented
by rich metadata and innovative visualization tools.4 (Figure 1
shows the reader’s Web-based access to the collection.)
The multidisciplinary approach of our project enables scholars
to go beyond the literary aspect of Cervantes’ works. As an
invaluable pictorial depository, we emphasize supplying
information regarding the historic value and artistic significance
of the images. The hermeneutic and aesthetic values of each
individual image have been carefully examined by art historians
and the results incorporated in the archive as scholarly
commentary. Additionally, we include biographical commentary
about artists and engravers. These rich scholarly commentaries
will help to boost the study of book illustration art, which has
been to date secondary in Art History, in aspects such as the
evolution of techniques, from the first woodcuts (early 17th
century) to modern mechanical offset (20th century), and the
influence or achievement of an individual engraver, illustrator,
or lithographer. We associate the text and the images through
a taxonomy of episodes, adventures and narrative motifs for
both parts of the Quixote. The 308 taxonomic elements in which
we have divided the 126 chapters of the text encompass as
descriptive categories the totality of the tradition of illustrations
present in the editions in our collection. (See Figure 2 for an
example selection from the taxonomy.)
The reader’s interface offers access to all the levels of editorial
annotation about the artists, textual location, image information
and technique, aesthetic and textual commentary. In addition,
users can obtain, through links, specific information related to
the narrative, biographical information about the creators, and
the meaning of engraving techniques. We are in the process of
incorporating these and other categories into our current search
tool, as well as developing a controlled vocabulary about themes
and characters in the Quixote and about generic area content

Digital Humanities 2007
(flora, fauna, architecture, music, etc.) to facilitate the use and
exploration of the images in the archive by researchers other
than literary scholars. (Figure 3 shows the advanced search
interface.)
As a multidisciplinary project that involves library staff
digitizing the images, computer scientists coding the
applications, Hispanic scholars providing textual editing and
edition metadata, art historians examining the image metadata,
and finally the general public traversing the archive, it is critical
to have an efficient production line and a strategy for
consistently sharing information among the different parties.
After several attempts, we reached a work flow that we found
to work efficiently. The procedure starts with Hispanic scholars
providing bibliographic information and specifying the editions
to be digitized, the pages where the images reside, and the
naming scheme for the electronic files. This information is
recorded on a work sheet and sent to library personnel. Upon
receiving such a work sheet, the library staff responsible for
the digitization reviews the information, clarifies any possible
discrepancies, digitizes the illustrations, and saves them on a
library server as archival TIFF files. A copy of the images is
then transferred to the development site where a computer
scientist processes them into JPEGs, whose sizes are more
appropriate for Web traffic. Afterwards, the references to the
JPEGs are added to the database. At that point, the interfaces
automatically update and these images become available online.
The art historian in charge of image metadata has access to the
original illustrations and then remotely enters the information
using the online Web form. As soon as these commentaries are
finalized, they are published online alongside the images.
A Web-based interface is provided for maintenance of the
collection. The collection maintenance application supports
management functions such as inserting, deleting, or modifying,
project-wide data. The editor's Web form also offers a typology
of illustrations divided into 17 categories, i.e., frontispiece,
vignette, portrait, map, etc., and a 17 item index of engraving
techniques. Much of the design effort in preparing this interface
has focused on specification of the most appropriate handling
of default values and modes. Using an iterative development
methodology, we have focused on the art historian’s tasks,
refining the means for inheriting and modifying values between
entries with the goal of focusing his data-entry activities on
differences rather than similarities. The taxonomic and
typological categories are part of the rich image metadata
approach we have developed to capture and make accessible
the variety of image content present in the iconography of the
Quixote. They are of value both to collection editor and reader
as they are part of the editor's metadata template and of the
reader’s advanced search tool. (Figure 4 shows the tools used
by the editor in specifying metadata.)

The readers’ Web-based interface, introduced earlier, which is
separate from the collection maintainer’s interface, also has
undergone refinement during the project’s development. At
present, it provides a four-layered browsing design: a) an edition
index; b) a thumbnail overview of one entire edition; c) a
low-resolution image together with meta-data; and d) a
high-resolution image. One interesting characteristic in the
public interface is the provision of uncommon relationships
among the artifacts. One particular example is the
ancestor-descent relationship. For instance, an engraver is often
related to another as his master or disciple, or even father or
son; one illustration or a set of illustrations is inherited from
an earlier edition as simply reprints or sometimes after
re-engraving. In cases where ancestral and/or familial ties exist,
we provide a description of the ties, as well as physical links
pointing to the referred artifacts for the purpose of more
in-depth investigation. Navigation along the ties provides an
intuitive way to look closely at the propagation of engraving
skills from one person to another, the effect of the technology
evolution upon art works as reflected in re-engravings, and the
significance, elegance, and popularity of certain artists or
illustrations serving as the archetypes for imitation. At present,
the links are manually encoded on a one-by-one basis. We are
in the process of setting up a keyword-anchor list for automatic
linking.5 (Figure 5 shows the reader’s views of the collection
and metadata.)
The project’s metadata is imbedded into a Dublin Core
framework. We use a MySQL server as the database core to
store the metadata and the references to image files. The
readers’ and maintainers’ Web-based applications occupy a
display tier on top of the database tier.
The availability of the archive will contribute to a more
complete understanding and appreciation of Cervantes’ novel
by initiating new explorations from many perspectives: textual,
artistic, critical, bibliographical, and historical. In particular,
we provide resources and assistance to examine the reception
and evolution of the Quixote’s readings across time, culture,
audience, and milieu. Furthermore, the images can be grouped
according to several layers of content to respond to the users’
need for information selection of a specific critical focus, i.e,
art, geography, history, etc. This is achieved by 1) cataloging
each image using a comprehensive taxonomy of the episodes
and adventures, 2) including multiple levels of textual
annotation about each individual illustration, including
technical, historical, and artistic information, and 3) providing
descriptive and critical commentary related to the content and
textual context of the illustrations. The result is a multi-layered
and multi-directional collection of digital objects recombining
bibliographical,
textual
and
visual
materials
(edition-text-image-metadata), and the development of a rich
hypertextual archive encompassing a new form of critical

n cultural heritage domains the central element of interest
in terms of information and knowledge, but also in terms
of objective and subjective value, is the object. Text is an
important medium in retrieving objects, or information about
these objects. Even in cases of non-textual cultural heritage
collections, text plays a crucial role, since text is the pervasive
medium used for metadata, next to numeric identification codes
and measurements (Chapman, 2005). At the same time,
language is a noisy and ambiguous medium, and usage of
textual metadata ultimately implies robustness to noise and
proper disambiguation. If the goal is to automate the process
of searching and retrieving information about objects from
digitized metadata, language technology can aid in
disambiguating, translating, and correcting textual metadata
(Bontcheva et al., 2002). In this paper we describe ongoing
work in the MITCH (Mining Information in Texts from the
Cultural Heritage) project in which we employ diverse language
technologies to enrich textual metadata of a large object
collection in the natural history domain.
Textual metadata can take many forms. Many document
collections are made searchable through the use of index
systems (pre-digital as well as digital) that use keywords, titles,
and proper names (e.g. of authors). Alternatively, objects may
be described more verbosely in annotations, captions,
Page 223

Digital Humanities 2007
explanatory texts for educational purposes or exhibitions, or
scholarly publications. A third type of textual metadata is the
thesaurus or ontology, which aims to capture a standardized
list or set of terms that occur in the domain, and possibly some
basic relations between them such as synonymy, hyponymy,
and hyperonymy, or more domain-specific relations. Fourth,
auxiliary resources peripheral to the domain may exist that
contain information of overlapping interest, such as lists of
geographical names.
There is a need, clearly expressed by many cultural heritage
institutions, for digitizing the metadata of cultural heritage
collections, in order to make them searchable and accessible at
unprecedented scales. After the basic metadata is digitized,
allowing simple keyword-based search, an important next step
is the enrichmentphase, the result of which enables more
complex and advanced types of search that better resemble the
typical questions of scholarly researchers. The key step in the
enrichment phase is to link all resources into a single network.
By establishing all meaningful links, a particular object
effectively becomes a node in this network, meaningfully
connected to all other entities that have a direct relation to that
object, such as the artist who created it, or the location in which
it was found.
By traversing the network, a search engine can explore complex
relations among sets of objects, and unions and intersections
of such sets, allowing, for instance, biologists to perform
large-scale searches for patterns and trends, such as the
occurrence of animals in a certain family, in particular stretches
of time (e.g. the last century) and space (e.g. the Amazon rain
forest). To achieve this goal, we develop language technology
of two types: (1) preprocessing technology for the automatical
correction and normalization of our textual resources, and (2)
metadata enrichment technology for identifying relevant
concepts in all textual metadata, and linking all resources into
a connected, searchable network.

Preprocessing: Automatic metadata
cleanup

T

he first step in enriching textual metadata is to make sure
that the textual metadata is as correct and consistent as
possible. In Sporleder et al. (2006a, 2006b) we describe two
complementary methods. The first method, horizontal
correction, aims at correcting inconsistent values in a database
record based on the other values in that record, and all other
records in the same database, while the second method, vertical
correction, focuses on values which were entered in the wrong
column. Both methods are language-independent, rely solely
on the database itself, and are fully automatic. Their novelty
lies in the fact that they can deal with textual material in
Page 224

database cells, where most traditional error correction methods
only work for numeric (Hawkins, 1980) or atomic categorial
data (Knorr and Ng, 1998).
In a range of experiments on a natural history specimen database
we observed that the two methods can effectively zoom in on
the errors in the database. Instead of having to manually inspect
all 16 thousand records in our database, each characterized by
47 attributes (columns), the methods only flag in the order of
several hundreds of errors. The errors flagged tend to capture
well above 90% of all actual errors, and typically raise about
as many false alarms as proper hits. The method is implemented
into a prototype system that draws the attention of the expert
user, with simple visual means, to alleged errors in the database.
The user is able to approve and effectuate the correction, or to
enter another correction, or to dismiss the error message.
Other cleanup methods currently under investigation are the
identification and normalization of different language versions
of the same location names (Van Erp, 2006), the disambiguation
of proper names referring to different entities (Bagga and
Baldwin, 1998) and the normalization of time expressions.

Automatic metadata generation

A

fter resources have been cleaned and normalized, similar
methods can be used to generate more metadata, in order
to improve access to the core data. Again, we follow a strategy
which is fully automatic and completely self-sufficient, not
relying on any source other than the data itself, because in the
typical cultural heritage domain there is little useful background
resource besides the data itself.
As a first example, Sporleder et al. (2006c) describe a
bootstrapping method to generate lists of proper names of
persons, locations, and taxonomic animal names from a
specimen database. In general, an object database offers its own
structured annotation by means of its column titles, such as
"location" (of the place where an animal specimen was found).
Gathering the contents of cells in a particular column results
in a list of named entities of that particular type, that may be
found elsewhere in the same database, e.g. in comment fields,
or in other textual metadata resources such as field books or
scholarly articles. These texts can then be linked to the entries
in the database that contain the same location name, and the
occurrences of the name in the other texts can be automatically
annotated as being "location" names.
In ongoing work we explore the usage of clustering methods
to discover hidden events that are not explicitly coded or
mentioned, but that do explain certain groupings of objects. An
example in the natural history domain is the concept of
expedition, which is not coded in the database, but which is the
cause for certain animals to be found within a concentrated

Digital Humanities 2007
period of time in a relatively restricted area by the same person
or group of persons. Adding such entities and linking them to
the objects that are associated to them, makes the object
database searchable in more than the original dimensions.

he Centre for Scholarly Editing and Document Studies
(CTB) is preparing a digital edition of De Trein der
Traagheid, a novella by the 20th century Flemish author Johan
Daisne. The project initially aimed at a print reading edition,
involving the constitution of a reading text based on a
text-critical analysis of 19 witnesses of the novella's print
history. However absent from the original project proposal, the
TEI markup scheme was adopted early in the project as the
means for digitally representing the edition. Its provisions for
marking up textual variation with the so-called
parallel-segmentation method informed the construction of a
single XML source text containing the transcriptions of all 19
text witnesses under consideration as well as the constituted
reading text, records of their mutual textual variation, and
editorial annotations. The subsequent development of the
electronic edition proved this unitary source text's potential for
modelling a microcosm of user-generated editions. This paper
will focus on characteristics, difficulties, and theoretical
challenges of this particular editorial constellation, as well as
the tools developed for probing into it.

well-established models for (creating) electronic scholarly
editions forced us to conceptualise the boundaries of this
particular electronic edition in the course of its development.
Initially, traditional notions of scholarly editing (explicitly
formalised as 'a print reading edition' in the initial project
proposal) provided a good starting point for the development
process. At first, development was guided by mimicking the
familiar print edition model, aimed at generating a reading text
with apparatus variorum from the XML source text. However,
this denotative model of the print edition (McCarty, 2004) soon
evolved to a guiding principle itself for conceptualising new
ideas, an exemplary model for electronic editions. The added
potential of an interactive edition framework allowing for
user-driven input opened up new ways of exploring possible
engagements of the user with the textual tradition. On a
theoretical level, this exemplary model for electronic scholarly
editions informed some challenging insights and rethinking of
the nature of this model's object (the edition).

Technology and tools

O

n the most basic level, the seminal potential of the XML
source text for our edition could be realised through the
use of several open source XML-related technologies and tools
that are currently being adopted as a standard amalgam for
accessing XML resources. Key technologies for deploying
XML texts like the Extensible Stylesheet Transformation
Language (XSLT) and XML Query language (XQuery) allow
for flexible manipulation and retrieval of XML encoded
information, commonly achieved through dedicated XSLT and
XQuery processors, and native XML databases.The advent of
XML publishing environments like the Cocoon web
development framework has made it possible to integrate these
functionalities in dynamic user interfaces for presenting and
querying XML content via easily accessible delivery
technologies such as a web browser. This integrative potential
stimulated the development of our XML text processing scripts
initially developed as a tentative instrument for a specific task,
to what we named the 'Morkel system', a generalisable suite of
XSLT and XQuery scripts for driving electronic scholarly
editions in an open source software environment.

reconstruction of this text version. A broader view on the
tradition can be accomplished by selecting a parallel edition,
in which different episodes in the textual tradition can be viewed
and contrasted, literally next to each other. This parallel
presentation mode of different text versions for visual
comparison resembles that of the Versioning Machine,
developed by the Maryland Institute for Technology in the
Humanities. Finally, the entire textual tradition can be taken
into account when a variorum edition is selected. In its ability
to compare any number of text versions with an orientation
version, this variorum edition is similar to the Juxta tool,
developed by the Applied Research in Patacriticism group at
the University of Virginia. The focal point of this text
comparison in the Morkel system is the contextual external
apparatus variorum containing only the relevant variants for
the selected comparison set and providing a locus for reorienting
the edition. This scope on the textual tradition can be further
refined on an intra-textual level. Complete text versions can be
compared, as well as separate text divisions (one of the 33
chapters or the dedication). Where applicable when comparing
different text versions, an entry to a generated apparatus is
provided both at chapter level and at paragraph level.

Edition formats

O

ne end of the delivery spectrum features the dynamic
XHTML visualisation discussed so far. The versatility
of XML equally allows for the generation of a PDF visualisation
of the (different) edition(s), closely resembling a traditional
print view of the textual tradition. A PDF rendering consists of
an orientation version, either as an integral text or as a chapter
sample, possibly compared to any number of comparison
versions, as reflected in an inline contextualised apparatus
variorum. However dynamic this generative edition frame is
(Vanhoutte & Van den Branden, forthcoming), its boundaries
are still present. To cater for this limitation and to enhance
scientific independence, the other extreme of the delivery range
is offered as well: the Morkel system equally allows users to
generate pure XML renderings of the selected comparison
version texts or chapters, containing their parallel-segmented
inline record of the textual variation. These source texts can
then be used in completely different usage scenarios, perhaps
featuring completely different software environments.

Views on textual tradition

I

n the course of its experimental development the Morkel
system became a tool facilitating a multi-faceted user-driven
view on the textual tradition captured in the unitary XML source
text.The scope of this view can be adjusted from micro- to
macro-level. Users can have access to singular texts in the
tradition, by requesting specific versions of the text as
orientation version which presents itself as a faithful
Page 226

Challenges

I

n short, the Morkel system enables users to generate their
own edition(s) along 3 axes (comparison set (19 text
witnesses and 1 reading text), textual scope (all or 1 of the 34
text divisions), delivery format (3 possible formats)), combining
to 58 different visualisation parameters. This generates the

Digital Humanities 2007
potential for 53.477.376 different views on the text, and
problematises some traditional text theoretical concepts, as well
as the defining role of tools for the electronic editions they
facilitate or constitute. An obvious consequence of this
generative edition paradigm (Vanhoutte & Van den Branden,
forthcoming) is the promotion of each text witness to a
candidate orientation version, instead of the adoption of one
text version as a base text for the edition against which all other
versions are calibrated. Instead, this calibration itself is made
relative by the possibility of restoring each different textual
witness as an autonomous landmark in the textual tradition,
thence allowing a forward or backward look into the tradition.
As a matter of fact, the constituted reading text itself has
become integrated as 'just' a (commented) view on the textual
tradition, against which all variant versions of the text can be
plotted. A dynamic selection of a comparison set not only
transforms the apparatus variorum to a dynamic, contextualised
rendering of the relevant textual variation, but equally promotes
it to a performative instrument for reorienting the edition to
another point in the textual history. Due to the dynamic selection
of comparison sets, the notion of variable classification becomes
relativised. Discerning different types of textual variants
becomes irrelevant: a variant can hold as a spelling variant in
one comparison set but can change classes and become a
semantic variant when compared to another version in the
textual tradition. The search capabilities of the Morkel system
even extend the view on the textual tradition from text level,
by allowing simple search operations inside one text version
(intra-textual), to collection level, by allowing complex search
operations over different text versions (extra-textual). To
conclude, this generative paradigm for electronic scholarly
editions seems to articulate the defining role of the specific
tools for accessing electronic texts more sharply. On its own,
the XML representation of text-critical research is a valuable
record of scientific labour, but it is the specific (generative)
interface which instantiates it as an editorial microcosm by
providing a range of user-driven access methods that enable
dynamic exploration of a textual tradition. The characteristics
and exact nature of this user-driven scholarly edition or
constellation of editions is strongly determined by the
boundaries this generative interface provides, allowing for a
microscopic, telescopic, stereoscopic, or kaleidoscopic view
on the textual tradition.

The TEI (Text Encoding Initiative)1 has provided a complex
and comprehensive system of provisions for scholarly text
encoding. Although a major focus of the “digital humanities”
domain, there is little evidence that it has been embraced by
and taught to humanities students at university level, which is
important to encourage the adoption of the TEI’s
recommendations and the widespread use of its text encoding
guidelines. Very little training material exists for either
individuals who wish to teach themselves TEI, or university
level teachers who wish to have access to adequate training
materials to use with their classes.
If the digital humanities community wants to promote the TEI
markup framework as a serious candidate for dedicated courses
in the booming curricula on digital humanities, humanities
computing, digital culture, or humanities informatics, to name
just a few of the labels this archipelago of disciplines gets, as
well as integrating the TEI further with digital librarianship,
then there is an urgent need for an on-line TEI course by
example which is less generic than the two tutorials published
on the TEI website (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard (2002a)
Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard (2002b)) and more user
friendly, comprehensive, and up to date than the “latest” Teach
Yourself TEI materials currently online (all of which date from
2002).2
The TEI By Example3 project is currently developing a range
of freely available online tutorials walking individuals through
the different stages in marking up a document in TEI. TEI By
Example aims to provide online tutorials which give examples
for users of all levels. Examples will be provided of different
document types, with varying degrees in the granularity of
markup, to provide a useful teaching and reference aid for those
involved in the marking up of texts. Likewise, the availability
Page 228

of a software toolkit for teaching text encoding will support the
potential trainers to take up the challenge to teach TEI on
several occasions. In order to support multilingualism in the
text encoding community, the on-line tutorials are being
considered for translation into a number of languages. The
translations proper, however, are outside the scope of this
project.
The deliverables of the project are: on-line tutorials TEI By
Example, a printable PDF version of the tutorials TEI By
Example, an on-line software toolkit for text encoding, a
downloadable CD-ROM image for burning off-line toolkits for
use by course participants, and adequate documentation to
enable the tutorials to be used elsewhere if needed.
Project partners are The Centre for Scholarly Editing and
Document Studies (CTB)4 of the Royal Academy of Dutch
Language and Literature, the Centre for Computing in the
Humanities (CCH)5 of King's College London, and the School
for Library, Archive, and Information Studies (SLAIS)6 of
University College London, with an international advisory
board consisting of experts in textual encoding and markup.
The deliverables will be published and hosted by CCH (King's
College London) under endorsement by the Association of
Literary and Linguistic Computing. Development of the tutorials
began in October 2006 and will start to appear online in Spring
2007. It is hoped that the project results will be relevant to the
trainers of TEI, the students of TEI, the text encoding, and the
humanities computing community in general.
A major point of attention at the start of the project was the
status of the TEI model. Since early 2002, the TEI Consortium
has been engaged in a major (backward-incompatible) revision
of the TEI specification, migrating it from version P4 (released
in 2002, see TEI (2004) to P5 (2005 onwards, see TEI (2005)).
Featuring more than just changes in the markup model and the
content of the guidelines, P5 entails an overhaul of the complete
production process of the standard. It seems that the timing of
this TEI By Example project coincides with a turning point in
the transition of TEI P4 to P5: the advantages of P5 adoption
for this project seemed to outweigh the disadvantages of P4.
The most recent snapshot indeed suggests that stability is at
hand (Van den Branden 2006). As a result, the project is
developing materials in P5.
Eight tutorials are under construction. The first, an introduction
to text encoding and the TEI, encourages the user to explore
textual encoding and markup to foster an understanding of why
this is useful, or even necessary, to allow texts to be processed
automatically and used and understood by others. The TEI
header tutorial covers the type of information and metadata
captured in the header element. Three tutorials focus on
examples of individual types of text: Prose, Poetry, and Drama,
and a further two tutorials deal with examples of Manuscript
Transcription and Scholarly Editing. The final tutorial

Digital Humanities 2007
investigates how the TEI can be customized, and the use of
ODD and Roma.
Although under development at time of writing of this poster
proposal, the tutorials will be available for demonstration by
Digital Humanities 2007, and this poster aims to highlight the
format, structure, testing, and development of the tutorials. As
well as informing the academic audience at DH2007, and
publicising the project, this poster will aim for feedback to
allow further development of the online material.

Introduction

I

n November 2005 the first volume of the Volledige Werken
(Complete Works) of Willem Frederik Hermans appeared.
This publication marked the official beginning of the largest
Dutch edition project ever undertaken in the field of modern
literature. There are two sides to the edition: a publication in
print, aimed at a general public, and a web site, where the reader
can find the editorial principles, a description of the textual
history and listings of editorial emendations. The project is
exceptional not only because of its size, but also because right
from the beginning it has been set up as an experimental digital
research project.

The initial impetus came from the need for automated text
comparison. An academic edition cannot do without careful
comparison of the different versions of a text. In the case of
Hermans, about one third of all print editions has been revised,
which brings the volume of research material to about 50,000
pages. This implied manual collation was not feasible. We will
give an overview of the procedure to transform a large amount
of print material into accurate digital text, demonstrate a system
which outputs XML-TEI-encoded collation results and show
an example of the possible uses of these documents.

W

illem Frederik Hermans is widely regarded as the most
important Dutch author of the second half of the
twentieth century. In addition to novels, Hermans (1921-1995)
wrote short stories, plays, poetry and essays; he also translated
several texts, including Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus. His work is receiving more and more
international attention; over the past few years several novels
have been translated into German, French and English. Beyond
Sleep (Nooit meer slapen) was hailed in the English press as a
Page 229

Digital Humanities 2007
forgotten masterpiece of post-war European literature, or in the
words of the Times ‘a welcome if belated introduction to an
original and challenging voice in modern European literature’.
Hermans was a very prolific author. The edition will consist of
a total of 24 volumes, each with an average of about 800 pages.
The Huygens Institute (a research institute within the Royal
Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences) is responsible for
the preparation of a reliable edition text in accordance to
scholarly standards. For each work, the last version Hermans
authorised is the point of departure for the critical edition. The
editors review this version in the light of the results of archival
research and of a comparison with selected other versions of
the text.

Automatic text comparison

T

raditionally the meticulous comparison of selected
versions of a text has been one of the most important tasks
of an editor. Until a few decades ago manual collation – which
is extremely time-consuming – was the only possibility.
However, in computer science theoretical and practical research
into automated text comparison has been taking place since the
1970s. In computer science, the general task of "text
comparison" has to be expressed as a formal procedure in order
to make the development of an algorithm possible. More
precisely, "text comparison" has been understood as a procedure
which results in a list of changes between two versions of a
text. The application of all changes to version A transforms
version A into version B. The algorithm should try to keep the
list as short as possible. This approach has led to a basic
algorithm by Eugene Myers, on which some variations have
been developed, and various implementations, of which the
Unix/Linux tool ‘diff’ is the most widely used. Source code
implementing this algorithm is readily available for all major
programming languages.
Somewhat apart from these developments in computer science,
in the world of scholarly editing there have also been initiatives
to use computers for text comparison and, by extension, for the
production of editions. The best-known examples are Peter
Robinson’s program Collate and Wilhelm Ott’s TUSTEP.
Collate is only available for the Macintosh Classic platform,
an operating system which has now been replaced by OS X.
The program is particularly suitable for older texts which have
been divided into relatively short passages beforehand and in
which there are not too many long or complex variants. The
algorithm used to extract variants remains undocumented. Mr.
Robinson has announced a successor to Collate called
EDITION. TUSTEP is actually a comprehensive environment
for textual research and the production of editions. It is a rather
complex instrument to work with and is more something like
a programming language in itself. Another impediment is the
absence of a graphical user interface (GUI). Recently, another
Page 230

interesting application, called Juxta, has become available.
Unfortunately, for now the program lacks the option to export
the collation results. According to the project web site, this will
change with the next release later this year.
On the one hand automatic text comparison has great
advantages: the comparison is based on a formally defined
algorithm, free of errors and in principle reproducible by others.
Moreover, the use of computers saves a huge amount of time,
which may be of crucial importance as often resources are
lacking to collate texts manually. On the other hand, there is
no ready-made solution for the average user; whichever option
is chosen, some extra training of the prospective user is
necessary, and experience with scripting will probably come
in handy. Of course this learning process also takes time and
energy. For small projects the effort may outweigh the
advantages, but considering the size of the Hermans project,
in this case the investment did seem worthwhile. To date we
have made extensive use of Collate and software tools such as
diff.
Automatic collation requires accurate digital sources. For a
scholarly edition, OCR-results aren't good enough. A checking
system is necessary. Moreover, some presentational markup
like quotes, the use of bold, italic etc., and expressive white
space has to be captured as semantic markup, while other
presentational features (page width, fonts used...) have no
importance, in any case for the Hermans edition, and can be
quietly disregarded. So a phase of checking and automatic
encoding before the actual collation is required. We will discuss
this operation in more detail in our poster presentation.

XML-encoded collation results

T

he result of these preparations are reliable and detailed
overviews of all the differences between sometimes a
dozen versions of a text, encoded as a base text with in-line
apparatus conforming to the TEI Guidelines. This means that
a complex text history can be examined down to the tiniest
detail in a manageable way. The use of XML enables the editor
to observe patterns in variants, to categorize findings, and to
examine them in greater detail. Due to systematic encoding of
the material the accumulated data can be searched accurately
and checked for correlations, and working hypotheses can be
continually tested (for example by using XML search languages
such as XPath and XQuery) and if necessary modified.
Currently, we are working on ways to present the multiple
versions of the text and the conclusions reached in research in
a dynamic way, partly on the basis of the digital research
documentation and the findings of the analysis of De tranen
der acacia’s (a major novel which appeared in the first volume).
During the poster session, we will display the short story

Digital Humanities 2007
‘Paranoia’. The digital presentation of this story contains the
reading text of the Hermans edition and all the text versions
which were of importance for the editorial research. We intend
to place a short introductory section before the full-text
documentation in which some important revisions in the short
story are discussed, as a reader’s guide. For example, in the
version of this story in the first publication in book form in
1953 Hermans puts more emphasis on the theme of the housing
shortage, which was a key concern in the Netherlands after the
war, especially in Amsterdam, where the story is set. Due to
adjustments in substance and narrative, the events in the book
version of ‘Paranoia’ are described more from the perspective
of the character Cleever than in the magazine publication of
1948, a significant revision in a story about someone who
suffers from persecution mania.
In the digital publication we will integrate observations and
analyses into the texts to which they refer, as a form of empirical
evidence. Relevant text passages will therefore be tagged in
the online presentation so that they can be seen separately and
in context. We are also examining other presentation options.
There are analyses conceivable, such as a narratological study
of narrative structure, which in the form of hypertext can serve
as a point of access or a guide to Hermans’s work. Ideally, in
future digital text presentations text and research will constitute
an integrated collection of data which can constantly be
consulted, modified and expanded. Or as Hermans himself once
put it: ‘...a collection, an enormous accumulation of movements
and ideas.’

A Textual Database of Dreams and the New
Context of Reading
Christian Vandendorpe (Département de letters françaises,
Université d’Ottawa)
The advent of the web has fostered the development of
specialised textual databases, dedicated to tabular collections
of snippets of our literary heritage. Their purpose is to facilitate
the study of a particular phenomenon through the centuries.
Henceforth, the act of reading tends to adopt a tabular way of
reading as the one advocated by Claude Levy Strauss for the
study of myths. In order to focus on a specific case, we shall
examine the textual mysql database <http://www.reves
.ca>, a collection of some fifteen hundred dream narratives
from various cultures since Homer and the Bible, and discuss
its goals and its initial interface. The challenge is to design an
interface that would be both efficient and exciting, inducing in
the reader the desire of reading and helping him or her to
explore the database and to make meaningful relations between
the data.

In this presentation, I will discuss the preliminary results of a
research initiative where we explored the relevance of applying
text mining techniques on a literary corpus. The corpus used
in this work is composed of short thematically-related literary
texts stored in a database. The main objective of this project is
twofold. First, we want to explore if traditional text mining
techniques can successfully be used to assist the extraction and
analysis of relevant information found in literary texts.
Secondly, we also want to explore if computer-assisted text
analysis tools and text mining techniques can be useful to help
access to valuable literary information stored in a textual
database. This talk will be divided in three main parts. First, I
will present the fundamental text mining concepts and
techniques. In the second part, I will describe the
computer-assisted text analysis processes that were applied on
the online textual database (<http://www.reves.ca>).
Finally, I will discuss some of the results we obtained and give
an overview of the future work that will be done in this project.

Introduction

E

lectronic scholarly editions which mimick conventional
models of scholarly editions as prescribed by different
theoretical and methodological schools provide denotative
models (Geertz, 1993, p. 93) which thrive on the otherness of
the digital medium but re-emphasize the computational aspect
of the 'computer-based' (Steding, 2002), 'Computergestützte'
(Kamzelak, 1999), or computer-assisted scholarly edition. The
isomorphism between the digital and the print medium aimed
at by the application of computational techniques to the praxis
of scholarly editing confirms what we already know. What is
interesting, however, is not the degree to which the computer
can assist the editor in digitizing, creating, and publishing an
edition, but the intentional artefacts which are built by using
the computer as a modelling tool (Smith, 2002). They are
instrumental in two crucial activities of humanities research,
that is, the discovery of meaning and the making of meaning.
As products of (experimental) modelling, their purpose is 'to
achieve failure so as to raise and point the question of how we
know what we know' (McCarty, 1999), 'what we do not know',
and 'to give us what we do not yet have.' (McCarty, 2004, p.
255) This paper will address the role of experimental modelling
and the assessment of exemplary models of scholarly editions
in the development of a useful classification, typology, and
description of electronic editions.

Classification

A
Page 232

s psycholinguistic research has shown, categorization is
innate in human cognition (Giannakopoulou, 2003) and

Digital Humanities 2007
involves the formation and use of patterns in a self-maximizing
system (deBono, 1978, pp. 25-43). Operations which can be
classified under this scholarly primitive are naming, labelling,
classifying, cataloguing, indexing, sorting, etc. Categorizing
as a mind process can result in the production of formalized
instruments such as bibliographies, indexes, catalogues,
classification schemes, and taxonomies for which advanced
subject analysis is needed. For the most part, however, it
remains a culturally determined mind tool particularly where
it is used for the selection of usefulness. This means that
categorizing is not determined by how the world is, but tries to
develop convenient ways in which to represent it (Hacking,
1999, p. 33).

The least useful typology of scholarly editions is based on the
publication medium. Here we have print edition, hybrid edition,
and electronic edition. Especially this last one is often presented
as a meaningful class while it is widely used to name almost
anything which is available in an electronic format. A sad
example is, for instance, the édition électronique of the
correspondence of René Descartes which is nothing more than
a 35 page MSWord file which has been made available online
<http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/Des
cartes/correspondance/descartes_correspon
dance.doc> .

Electronic editions
Traditions and Typologies

T

extual scholarship is fragmented by the development of
different theories, methods, and praxes which are based
on a diversity of attitudes and perspectives (author, language,
audience, function, format, etc.). This becomes especially clear
when studying current typologies and classification schemes
for scholarly editions. Heinrich Meyer (1992) surveyed the
literature on textual scholarship in Germany in the twentieth
century and listed more than forty names for different types of
editions that were used. As he argued, the 'ausgabentypoligische
Terminologiewirrwarr' (Meyer, 1992, p. 17) is the result of a
methodological pluralism both inside and across editorial
traditions.
As a consequence, there is no one theoretical paradigm for
textual scholarship across all traditions, periods, languages, and
authors and there is no one universally applicable taxonomy of
editorial types. Moreover, the existing taxonomies are seldom
internally consistent in their applied perspective. The simplified
representation in the German school, for instance, offers a
taxonomy which runs from the archive edition over the
historical-critical edition to the study and the reading edition
(Kanzog, 1970, pp. 9-44). Where 'archive edition' denotes the
archival function of this type of edition and hints at the extent
of the documentary set presented, 'historical-critical' refers both
to the method used to create the edition and the format in which
that edition comes before the user. The study-edition and
reading edition, on the other hand, identify the envisioned
function of the product and its intended audience in their
naming. In the Anglo-American tradition, the copy-text edition
refers to a specific theory of establishing a text whereas the
types of scholarly editions David Greetham mentions in his
Textual Scholarship. An Introduction mainly refer to the format
or appearance of the edition, such as 'parallel print edition',
'variorum edition', or 'type facsimile edition', or to a combination
of format and method such as 'Eclectic Clear-Text Edition with
Multiple Apparatus'. (Greetham, 1994, p. 383)

W

ith respect to the classification of electronic editions,
it becomes difficult to maintain the application of
conventional typologies and taxonomies, or ignore them
altogether. The danger of a normative typology and hence a
rigid theoretical frame for textual scholarship is that it
establishes its principles firmly without allowing the
advancement of its theories, methodologies, and practices.
However, as a scholarly discipline, scholarly editing should be
interested in both. Especially when, in the case of electronic
scholarly editing, exemplary modeling is employed as a
scholarly method to generate electronic editions rather than the
epigonuous application of rigid theory and method to the
electronic edition.

Classification Generator

F

or reasons of identification and bibliographic research on
electronic editions (Lavagnino, 1996; Dahlström, 2002;
Kirschenbaum, 2002; Van der Weel, 2005), there is a need for
some integrated scheme by which editors of electronic editions
can describe their edition according to several parameters. With
the classification generator which we propose here, we believe
we have developed a tool which can be of aid to that purpose.
The classification generator is an on-line tool which allows the
editor to input the details of the electronic edition atomized in
meta-information on the edited text (language, period, genre)
and information on the edition via a user-friendly form. The
latter minimally contains details about method, intended
audience, content, format, encoding, technology, function, and
functionality of the edition. Once the edition is described
according to these parameters, a descriptive classification code
is generated that can be included in the published edition. This
classification code is an alphanumerical string that exactly
describes the electronic edition from multiple perspectives. The
classification generator serves at least three goals. First, it
liberates the field of electronic scholarly editing from the
conventional text-editorial theories with their rigid and
Page 233

Digital Humanities 2007
inconsistent prescriptive typologies. Instead the classification
generator atomizes the different facets of the electronic edition
and presents the sum total of this documentation as a description
of the product. Second, the user confronted with an electronic
edition gets a detailed description of the kind of electronic
edition one is using on inputting the classification code in the
classification generator. Third, the codes derived from the
classification generator can be of use for an (analytical)
bibliography of electronic editions. The description of an
improved re-release of an electronic edition will generate a
different classification code which could be collated against
the codes of other releases of the same edition.

A last feature of the classification generator is the option to
register an edition's classification code together with a formal
bibliographic description in a database. This database will allow
theorists of electronic scholarship and bibliographers of new
media to perform interesting forms of analysis on its contents.

MusicXML: An XML Based
Approach to Automatic
Musicological Analysis
Raffaele Viglianti (raffaeleviglianti@gmail.com)
University of Pisa
Italy

1. Introduction

C

omputational music is a young discipline undergoing
ever increasing development. Most research conducted
to date concerns digital audio, multimedia, automatic
composition, score writing, etc. A humanities-oriented approach
(i.e. musicological) is a more recent, less well-defined
development, though it is also growing.
The application of such studies regard, to mention only a few:
•
•
•
•

automatic extraction of statistics;
verification of grammar rules applied to music;
automatic application of models for formal and harmonic
analysis;
validation of models for different analysis types.

The MIDI format is the technology most often used in
computational music. Developed in the early 1980s, MIDI is
a digital representation of music, used especially for
communication between electronic musical instruments,
including computers. The MIDI message associates an integer
number to each note (e.g. central C is 60), so it is suitable to a
wide range of studies.
A newer technology, MusicXML, offers the same possibilities
and more, but requires different techniques for data retrieval.
The following abstract presents the results of a statistical
analysis of the tenor parts of some operas by Giacomo Puccini,
encoded in MusicXML for the Research Institution “Centro
Studi Giacomo Puccini” in Lucca, Italy. Specifically, it
examines the arias of Rodolfo from La Bohème and Principe
Calaf from Turandot.
The encoding of these musical pieces was discussed in one of
the author’s thesis dissertation for his degree in Computer
Science for the Humanities at the University of Pisa, under the
supervision of Professor Elena Pierazzo. The dissertation deals

with the possibilities for automatic applications illustrated in
section 4 herein.

2. What is MusicXML?

L

LC is an American Internet music publishing and software
company; it developed and promoted the MusicXML
encoding language, which can represent the music notation
system established in the West since the 17th Century.
MusicXML is a royalty-free format that implements all the
features offered by XML technology:
•
•
•
•

data structure
modularity
extensibilty
possibility of querying and interaction through XML family
technologies.

MusicXML is designed to represent a score in a digital format,
so most of information contained in a human-readable score is
retrievable in the encoding and can be used for various kinds
of analyses. Features such as lyrics, author or reviewer notes,
dynamics, agogic indications, and so on, are encoded with their
position in the score.
An important part of the encoding is the Score Header, which
contains metadata, such as author, poet, work number,
instruments, etc. An instrument data section even enables
specifying the MIDI instrument channel to be used to play the
music.

3. Automatic statistical extraction:
an example application.

T

he encoded tenor parts have been inserted into eXist, an
Open Source XML database, to be queried with the
XQuery language.
The goal was to extract statistical data with relevance to the
humanities. Indeed, such data was used for a musicological
dissertation on vocalism in Puccini’s works.
The statistics are based on the criteria proposed by Marco
Gilardone and Franco Fussi in Le voci di Puccini. Un’indagine
sul canto (The Voices of Puccini. An inquiry on singing). The
statistics presented in such work were extended and adapted to
include the ossias.1
The statistics are the percentage occurrences in the distribution
of notes according to the following classification of tones:

Page 235

Digital Humanities 2007
occur in different ways and can be found by considering the
melodic interval.2
Consider, for example, the following sequence of notes:

The upper and lower limits are the extreme notes of the analyzed
part; the numbers beside to the notes denote the octave; the
notes highlighted in grey are transition tones, which are
interesting due to their difficulty of execution within the part.

Figure 1

Between C and E there is an interval of two tones, while E and
D are separated by only one tone. If the following sequence

The original statistics were extended to account for the
incidence of dynamic aspects such as piano, pianissimo,
mezzoforte, forte in transition tones and acute tones.
The XQuery query language was used, as it offers many
possibilities for data extraction from an XML database, though
it is often redundant and does not provide for complex structures
such as arrays or the like.
Starting with the retrieved numerical data, a musicologist can
construct a dramatic character profile. For example, Calaf’s
singing parts exhibit a high percentage of acute tones (27.39%),
transition tones (17.63%) and a high ratio between acute and
grave tones. This is a deliberate aesthetic choice, made to
portray a character in less realistic terms than other tenor roles,
perhaps because he is part of a fantastic drama; indeed, his
vocality tends to be heightened.
Rodolfo, instead, exhibits ‘milder’ musical behavior; he sings
less transition notes (10.37%), and those with dynamic
indications are sung in piano. The middle tones are greatly
predominant (69.63%); Rodolfo is indeed a character who tends
to be more intimate, and displays less dramatic presence.
All the statistics are produced via a query, and each piece of
information needed for calculations is furnished directly from
the encoded score.
Beginning with this model, many other searches may be carried
out, such as graphs or division of the notes in each act, etc.
Deeper analysis with the model provides for clearer delineation
of a character’s profile.

4. Thematic extraction based on
Retì’s musicological analysis

I

n the 1950s, Rudolf Retì developed a musicological analysis
based on the repetition of thematic cells. Such cells may

Page 236

Figure 2

occurs later on in the part, it can be compared to the sequence
in figure 1, because the intervals correspond: there is an interval
of two tones between G and B, and one tone between B and A.
Retì views entire compositions as based on a few thematic cells.
The cell can occur in the same sequence as the initial one or in
a different sequence, that is:
•
•
•

notes in inverse order
exchanged position of the notes
transposition to different notes, but with the same interval.

Any transformation of the cell can also occur with
“interpolated” notes, which are inserted between the principal
notes.
Starting from the corpus encoded in the author’s dissertation
for the Research Institute Centro Puccini, an algorithm was
envisioned for automatic retrieval of the repercussions of such
thematic cells.
Although such algorithm was implemented with XQuery, it
proved unable to fulfill the task, because of the lack of advanced
structures in XQuery. The study is still ongoing, as is the
implementation of the algorithm in other programming
languages, in particular, Java or Perl.

Digital Humanities 2007

5. Limits of MusicXML

E

ven if MusicXML offers many possibilities for research,
not every prerequisite of high level academic research
can be satisfied: it is designed to be a sufficient but not optimal
representation of musical scores. For instance, with MusicXML
it is impossible to encode ossias, but for this research it was
enough to encode only one of the two options of the score. On
the other hand , the encoding model would not be optimal for
a study that has as a goal to represent a score exactly as it
appears. Anyway MusicXML is extensible and many other
encoding models can be developed starting from the actual
model. At this stage it should be pointed out that there are other
encoding models that are starting to be used in the academic
research, such as MEI (Music Encoding Initiative). MEI is
designed to represent with effectiveness also information about
the physical support and provides a more complex structure of
metadata. Still the weakness of MEI is the lack of plug-ins that
can convert from score writing software or from optical
recognition programs. As a matter of fact, most research based
on MEI uses XSLT technology to convert from MusicXML to
MEI. This area of research is constantly evolving.

6. Conclusions

T

he abstract presents MusicXML as an alternative
technology for conducting automatic analysis of music,
adopting a statistical approach. The potentials of such
techniques are considerable: in the future they are likely to be
applied for advanced research, such as pattern matching and
automatic formal analysis, or for added encoding, including
commentaries, metadata for retrieval, harmonic analyses, as
well as for retrieval from digital collections of scores.

The Use of TEI and OAI in
Manuscript, an
Informational-Analytical System

urrently there are at least a few hundred ancient Slavic
manuscripts of the 11th to 14th centuries, which, despite
their significant scholarly, cultural, and historic value, are not
accessible to a wide range of researchers of various specialties
and to all who are interested in Russian history and culture.
The reason is simple: a large portion of the manuscripts are still
unpublished, and if they are published, these editions are
rareties, accessible only in major research libraries, which are
often located far from scholars' places of work. Even publishing
a manuscript often requires constant consultation of the original,
especially if studying its paleography, appearance, or other
similar questions. Furthermore, existing print editions
unfortunately usually lack reference material necessary for
getting acquainted with a text and studying it, and the
manuscripts themselves are published with poor quality. The
solution to the inaccessibility of ancient and medieval
manuscripts for research, teaching, and popular use is the
creation of electronic publications capable not only of replacing
print editions but also of exceeding their capabilities: (a) by
providing continual access to digital copies of manuscripts and
reference material on the Internet; (b) by providing the user
with the capability of retrieving data from a multifunctional
interface not only on the level of meta- and analytical data but
also on the level of grammatical, semantic, and thematic
characteristics of texts; and (c) by allowing collaborative work
on a manuscript.

O

ne example of an information system designed to solve
some of the above problems is Manuscript, an
informational-analytical system.
Manuscript is oriented toward the entry, storage, automatic
manipulation, research, and publication of ancient texts having
an identical graphico-orthographic appearance and structure to
the original. Currently Manuscript contains a few dozen unique
ancient and medieval Slavic texts.
Currently Manuscript consists of a few multifunctional modules
that interact with a single database containing a hierarchically
structured data:

a specialized editor,
a query and retrieval module,
a module for electronic publishing,
a module of linguistic dictionaries, and
a module for loading texts and reference material for print
publication.

The main task right now of the team behind Manuscript is to
present the accumulated information for analysis and study by
a wide range of researchers. The main path: to create specialized
modules intended for muti-function, user-friendly, and
straightforward manipulation of the data. The second task is to
create the means to exchange meta-, analytical, and textual data
between teams of researchers creating analogous collections
of material, with the goal of presenting users with the ability
to use manuscript- and text-specific tools for working with
ancient documents, created by various teams.

and fragments themselves, and also for formulating queries and
retrieving information using these findings. Searching in this
module is possible only using meta- and analytical data.
A special module processes user queries for retrieving certain
elements of text in TEI format from Manuscript. The main
capabilities of the module are the following:
•
•

•
•

retrieving of any element of text, stored in Manuscript as
an independent unit, in TEI format;
setting priorities in the creation of a TEI document: This
option is necessary in order to get around the
single-hierarchy limitation of XML. The user can rank the
priority of various structures within a document;
receiving meta- and analytical information with or without
full text;
The queried document is created at the moment of query,
so any change will be available immediately.

It's essential to use standard formats and protocols to maximize
access to the various tools for aggregating information in
Manuscript.

he Open Archive Initiative (OAI) and Text Encoding
Initiative (TEI) were chosen as the basis for solving this

task:
•
•

OAI – for indexing the existing texts and their fragments;
TEI – for presenting meta- and analytical information, and
likewise the texts themselves.

Manuscript is currently working to become an OAI data
provider. A new module is being developed to present the
metadata in Dublin Core format. This module will allow the
gathering of metadata not only from the texts themselves but
also from their fragments (various elements of the hierarchy).
Users can retrieve metadata or full text from Manuscript in TEI
XML format using a unique identifier.
The TEI Guidelines are well-established around the world, so
it was entirely logical for the developers of Manuscript to use
it for the metadata and full text of the manuscripts.
Manuscript uses a network model of data for describing the
objects (entities) of manuscripts and the relations between them,
so the main problem with using TEI was XML's requirement
of a strict hierarchy. One consequence of this is that it's
impossible to receive all information about a text in Manuscript
in one document.
Two modules are being developed to integrate the technology
of Manuscript with the TEI.
The module for storage and manipulation of meta- and
analytical data is intended for working with archeographical,
textological, and other findings from the manuscripts, texts,

During the presentation, Manuscript, including the
above modules and technologies, will be demonstrated.

Topic:
Created by scholars in collaboration with librarians/archivists,
thematic research collections are directed primarily at other
scholars, though they are also used by students and by the
general public. Their development and preservation pose several
challenges: 1) they require very detailed encoding and metadata
to serve their demanding audience; 2) they often involve
materials which are dispersed; and, 3) critically, they
incorporate a variety of different types of materials with
different digitization and metadata requirements. Digital
thematic research collections often include texts, images, finding
aids to archival material, and administrative records. While
standards have been developed for each of these data and
metadata types (e.g., TEI, TIFF, EAD, and MODS), there has
not yet been a disciplined effort to integrate the standards and
explore where overlap and commonalities are, and to document
best practices for recording appropriate metadata with a
minimum of duplication.

These issues are crucial to creators of digital thematic research
collections because 1) the primary resources are held by the
archives and libraries, and many of the repositories are
digitizing materials and making them available to scholars,
even though the digital representations frequently are not as
richly represented as those which the scholars will ultimately
create; 2) archives and libraries will ultimately be responsible
for the collections that are created; and 3) if publishers are to
have a role in the publication of digital thematic research
collections, standards will be essential for portability, and these
standards will by and large come out of the library world.
That said, thematic collections are generally far more complex
and dependent on intricate metadata interrelations than digital
objects created for most digital libraries. This complexity is
due in part to the interpretive aspects of projects in which
scholars are deeply engaged with the materials. For example,
the poetry manuscripts section of the Whitman Archive
incorporates images, transcriptions with scholarly annotations,
copyright and administrative information, and finding aids. All
of these materials are encoded, presented through XSLT
stylesheets, and made available via various search options. The
Whitman Archive uses an array of data and metadata standards:
TIFF, TEI, EAD, and MODS. Because of its complexity, the
Whitman Archive is a good case study for investigating the use
and adequacy of Metadata Encoding and Transcription Standard
(METS) as a bundling tool for coordination of the standards
found in digital thematic research collections.
In 2005, the Institute of Museum and Library Services awarded
a two-year grant to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to
explore interoperability of metadata for thematic research
collections and to demonstrate the power of METS as an
ingestion package. The current project builds on an earlier grant
project to create an integrated guide to dispersed manuscripts.
One hypothesis of the current project is that by standardizing
the way metadata is encoded, creators of digital thematic
research collections can make their work more sustainable and
ingestible; in other words, digital scholarship will be collected
in a form that will allow libraries and other entities to
incorporate into their holdings digital thematic research
collections created at diverse locations by a variety of scholars.
As the research team’s work has progressed, the group has
naturally experienced evolution in its thinking and approaches
to metadata. Members of the project team will report on project
processes and findings.

Organization:

K

atherine L. Walter, Co-Director of the Center for Digital
Research in the Humanities (CDRH) and co-project
director for the interoperability of metadata project, will provide
a brief introduction to the topic, including a description of
Page 239

Digital Humanities 2007
thematic research collections such as the Whitman Archive, the
varying types of metadata that may be involved, the impetus
to study integration of overlapping standards for such
collections, and the project goals originally set by the research
team. Walter will introduce speakers, moderate the panel, and
invite questions from the audience at the end.
Brett Barney, Senior Associate Editor and Project Manager of
the Walt Whitman Archive, will describe the team’s approach
to exploring what constitutes redundancy in metadata and its
exploration of questions such as what is really redundancy and
what is not? When is it desireable and when is it not? Does
redundancy stymie ingestion or aid it? His report will pose
conclusions regarding the value of redundancy and its
drawbacks in the ingestion of thematic research collections into
open-source library catalogs. Barney will also describe the
thinking of the team in selecting different kinds of representative
digital objects in the Whitman Archive for the ingestion
demonstration project.
Julia Flanders, Women Writers’ Project, Brown University,
will describe issues raised for scholars in contributing all or
part of a thematic research collection into library catalogs.
Questions explored will include what responsibility does an
acquiring library have to preserve or honor a scholar’s intentions
in creating and shaping such a collection? Is a library in fact
ingesting a collection or simply objects in a collection? This
will include thoughts on preserving contextual aspects of
thematic research collections, navigational features, and
interface. As a member of a standards board, she will speak
about the value of this kind of research for standards bodies.
Terence Catapano, Special Collections Analyst/Librarian,
Libraries Digital Program, Columbia University, will describe
the importance and adequacy of METS as a publication and
ingestion package, or in OAIS terms, how a Submission
Information Package (SIP) is derived for ingestion into a Digital
Library, and the development of a METS Profile for Thematic
Research Collections. Catapano will briefly describe work of
digital library projects that helped inform this study, such as
the DLF MODS Implementation Guidelines for Cultural
Heritage Materials, Descriptive Metadata Guidelines for RLG
Cultural Materials, DLF Aquifer, and others.
Daniel Pitti, Associate Director of the Institute for Advanced
Technology in the Humanities will discuss whether metadata
should exist in different forms at different stages; and describe
ingestion of the Whitman Archive into FEDORA, what this
means for other thematic research collections, and reflect on
the thoughts the FEDORA group at the University of Virginia
has with respect to preservation of such collections.

Three Play Effects: Eliza,
Tale-Spin, and SimCity
Noah Wardrip-Fruin (nwf@ucsd@edu)
University of California San Diego

I

n the mid-1960s Joseph Weizenbaum created a stunning
piece of software. Years before HAL 9000's screen debut
in 2001: A Space Odyssey, this software, Eliza, made it possible
to have a conversation with a computer. Eliza's most famous
script, Doctor, caused the software to parody the conversational
patterns of non-directive therapists during an initial visit. While
Eliza/Doctor can seem quite smart at first blush, each script for
Eliza is actually just a set of linguistic tricks. Most of these
tricks use keyword-driven "decomposition rules" to take the
user's last statement, divide it into pieces, and selectively reuse
portions to rephrase it as a question.
But when we interact with a piece of software we don't
necessarily get a clear picture of how it actually operates
internally. And many users of Eliza/Doctor initially developed
very mistaken ideas about its internals. Weizenbaum (1976)
discusses users who assumed that, since the surface appearance
of an interaction with the program could resemble something
like a coherent dialogue, internally the software must be very
complex. Some at first thought it must be something close to
the fictional HAL: a computer program intelligent enough to
understand and produce arbitrary human language. This
happened so often, and was so striking, that computer science
circles developed a specific term for this kind of
misunderstanding: "the Eliza effect."
This paper is a brief look at the Eliza effect, and at two
previously-unnamed effects that can arise in the relationship
between the surface appearance of a digital system and its
internal operations. More specifically, this paper looks where
others haven't when exploring versions of this relationship: the
area of play.
While the initial experience of Eliza/Doctor can create the
surface impression of an incredibly complex internal system,
sustained interaction with the system, the verbal back-and-forth,
invites play ... and linguistic play with Eliza/Doctor quickly
begins to destroy the illusion. In other words, precisely the
open-ended textual interaction that helped foster the illusion of
internal complexity and intelligence enables play that draws
attention to the system's rote simplicity, its distance from human
interaction.

Digital Humanities 2007
On the other hand, a sort of inverse of the Eliza effect can be
seen with James Meehan's 1976 Tale-Spin, the first major story
generation program. Tale-Spin generates stories from rules for
character behavior and a set of facts about the virtual world.
When generating stories in interaction with an audience it asks
questions to fill in details about locations, objects, relationships,
and so on. In addition, internal Tale-Spin mechanisms draw
"inferences" from the facts. For example, if it is asserted that
a character is thirsty, then the inference mechanisms result in
the character knowing she is thirsty, forming the goal of not
being thirsty, forming a plan for reaching her goal, etc.
Further, Tale-Spin characters can use its inference mechanisms
to "speculate" about the results of different courses of action.
Meehan's The Metanovel (1976) describes a story involving
such speculation, in which a hungry Arthur Bear asks George
Bird to tell him the location of some honey. We learn that
George believes that Arthur trusts him, and that Arthur will
believe whatever he says. So George begins to use the Tale-Spin
inference mechanisms to "imagine" other possible worlds in
which Arthur believes there is honey somewhere. George draws
four inferences from this, and then he follows the inferences
from each of those inferences, but he doesn't find what he's
after. In none of the possible worlds about which he's speculated
is he any happier or less happy than he is now. Seeing no
advantage in the situation for himself, he decides, based on his
fundamental personality, to answer. Specifically, he decides to
lie.
This is a relatively complex piece of psychological action, and
certainly tells us something about George as a character. But
the surface output of a Tale-Spin story never contains any
information about this kind of action. No matter how creatively
one plays with Tale-Spin, such hidden action cannot be deduced
from its surface. This is probably why, though Tale-Spin is seen
as a landmark in computer science circles, it is often treated
with near-ridicule in literary circles. Janet Murray, Espen
Aarseth, Jay David Bolter, and other critics have failed to see
what makes Tale-Spin interesting, focusing instead on what its
output looks like on the surface. Or, to put it another way,
Tale-Spin fails to display its interesting internal processes in a
manner that makes them visible to even the most careful of
critics.
This situation is far from uncommon in digital media, perhaps
particularly in the digital arts, where fascinating processes —
drawing on inspirations ranging from John Cage to the cutting
edge of computer science — are often encased in an opaque
surface. In fact, this effect is at least as common as the Eliza
effect, though I know of no term that describes it. Given this,
I propose "the Tale-Spin effect" as a term for works that appear,
on their surface, significantly less complex than they are
internally.

An effect quite different from both of these can be seen in the
case of Will Wright's 1989 game SimCity. The seed for this
project was planted as Wright created a landscape editor for
authoring his first game, an attack helicopter simulation.
Working with the editor, he realized he was having more fun
making virtual spaces than blowing them up. From this the idea
for Wright's genre-defining SimCity was born.
SimCity, of course, unlike a terrain editor, doesn't simply wait
for a user to do something. Time begins passing the moment a
new city is founded. A status bar tells the player what's needed
next — starting with basic needs like a residential zone and a
power plant and, if play succeeds for any period, ramping up
to railroads, police stations, stadiums, and so on. As cities grow,
areas respond differently. Some may be bustling while others
empty out, or never attract interest. SimCity provides different
map views that can help diagnose problems with abandoned
areas. Players can try changing existing areas of the city (e.g.,
building additional roads) or create new areas with different
characteristics. Observation and comparison offer insights,
while answers are found by trying different approaches and
considering the results.
In other words, the process of play with SimCity is one of
learning to understand the system's operations. Conversely, as
Wright explains, the challenge of game design is to create a
surface experience that will make it possible for audiences to
build up an appropriate model of the system internals.
Here, again, we lack a term for an experience. I propose "the
SimCity effect" for this important phenomenon: a system that,
through play, brings the player to an accurate understanding of
the system's internal operations. Of course, the SimCity effect
is named for cases where the system is complex, but the
phenomenon can be observed generally. Pong works as well
as it does because it effectively communicates at the surface
level its quite simple internal operations.
What is exciting about the SimCity effect, and about Wright's
work generally, is that it helps us get at the new possibilities
opened by working with computational media. Pong is very
similar to games we play without computers, but SimCity is a
more complex system than even the most die-hard Avalon Hill
fan would want to play as a tabletop game. This ability to work
with computational processes, to create complex computational
systems, is the opportunity that digital media affords — and
the SimCity effect points the way toward creating experiences
of this sort that succeed for audiences.

Abstract:

T

his paper describes the results of research carried out
during the LAIRAH (Log analysis of Internet Resources
in the Arts and Humanities) project (<http://www.ucl.a
c.uk/slais/circah/lairah/>) which is based at
UCL’s School of Library Archive and Information Studies. It
was a fifteen month study (reporting in October 2006) to
discover what influences the long-term sustainability and use
of digital resources in the humanities through the analysis and
evaluation of real-time use.
At Digital Humanities 2006 we reported on the early stages of
the project, in which we carried out deep log analysis of the
AHDS and Humbul portals to determine the level of use of
digital resources. (Warwick et al. 2006) This proposal will
discuss the results of the final phase of the research in which
we examined digital resources from the point of view of those
who designed and built them. We aimed to discover whether

Page 242

Digital Humanities 2007
there were common characteristics and elements of good
practice linking resources that are well- used.
Numerous studies have been carried out into the information
needs and information seeking practices of humanities scholars
(Barrett, (2005) Talja and Maula (2003), Herman (2001) and
British Academy, (2005)). However, our research is original
because it surveys the practices of those who produce digital
humanities resources. We also based the selection of our
projects on deep log analysis: a quantitative technique which
has not previously been applied to digital humanities resources
to ascertain real usage levels of online digital resources.

Method:

W

e selected a sample of twenty one publicly funded
projects with varying levels of use, covering different
subject disciplines, to be studied in greater depth. We classified
projects as well-used if the server log data from the Arts and
Humanities Data Service (AHDS) and Humbul portals showed
that they had been repeatedly and frequently accessed by a
variety of users. We also mounted a questionnaire on these sites
and asked which digital resources respondents found most
useful. Although most nominated information resources, such
as libraries, archives and reference collections for example the
eDNB, three UK publicly funded research resources were
mentioned, and thus we added them to the study. We also asked
representatives of each AHDS centre to specify which resources
in their collections they believed were most used. In the case
of Sheffield University the logs showed that a large number of
digital projects accessed were based at the Humanities Research
Institute. We therefore conducted interviews about the HRI and
its role in fostering the creation of digital humanities resources.
The selected projects were studied in detail, including any
documentation and reports that could be found on the project’s
website. We also interviewed a representative of the project,
either the principal investigator or a research assistant.

Results:
Institutional context:
The majority of projects that we interviewed had been well
supported in technical terms, and this had undoubtedly aided
the success of the project, especially where it was associated
with a centre of digital humanities excellence such as the Centre
for Computing in the Humanities at Kings College London or
the HRI at Sheffield. Critical mass aided the spread of good
practice in the construction and use of digital resources in the
humanities. Where a university valued such activities highly

they tended to proliferate. More junior members of staff were
inspired to undertake digital humanities research by the success
of senior colleagues and early adopters respected for their
traditional and digital research. Unfortunately such critical mass
is relatively rare in UK universities and some PIs reported that
their digital resource was not understood or valued by their
departments, and thus their success had not lead to further
digital research.

Staffing:
PIs also stressed how vital it had been to recruit the ideal RAs.
These were however relatively difficult to find, as they had to
have both disciplinary research expertise and good knowledge
of digital techniques. Most RAs therefore required training,
which many PIs often found lacking or of poor quality. A
further frustration was the difficulty of finding funding to
continue research, this meant that an expert RA might leave,
necessitating further training of a new employee if the project
was granted future funding.

Dissemination:
The strongest correlation between well-used projects and a
specific activity was in the area of dissemination. In all the
projects studied, staff had made determined efforts to
disseminate information as widely as possible. This was a new
challenge for many humanities academics, who were more used
to writing books, marketed by their publishers. This might
include giving papers at seminars and conferences both within
the subject community and the digital humanities domain;
sending out printed material; running workshops, and in the
most unusual instance, the production of a tea-towel!

User contact:
Very few projects maintained contact with their users or
undertook any organised user testing, and many did not have
a clear idea how popular the resource was or what users were
doing with it. However, one of the few projects that had been
obliged to undertake user surveys by its funders was very
well-used, and its PI had been delighted at the unexpected
amount and range of its use. Another project came to the belated
realisation that if it had consulted users the process of designing
the resource would have been simpler and less demanding.

Documentation:
Few of the projects kept organised documentation, with the
exception of those in archaeology, linguistics and archival
studies, where such a practice is the norm in all research. Most
projects had kept only fragmentary, internal documents, many
of which would not be comprehensible to someone from
Page 243

Digital Humanities 2007
outside. Documentation could also be difficult to access, with
only a small minority of projects making this information
available from its website. This is an important omission since
documentation aids reuse of resources, and also provides vital
contextual information amount its contents and the rationale
for its construction that users need to reassure them about the
quality of the resource for academic research.

documentation template. This should specify what should
be documented and to what level of detail.

Users:
•

Sustainability:
Another area of concern was the issue of sustainability.
Although the resources were offered for deposit with the AHDS,
few PIs were aware that to remain usable, both the web interface
and the contents of the resource would require regular updating
and maintenance, since users tend to distrust a web page that
looks outdated. Yet in most cases no resources were available
to perform such maintenance, and we learnt of one ten year old
resource whose functionality had already been significantly
degraded as a result.

•

Conclusion and recommendations

•

W

•

ell-used projects do therefore share common features
that predispose them to success. The effect of
institutional and disciplinary culture in the construction of
digital humanities projects was significant. We found that
critical mass was vital, as was prestige within a university or
the acceptance of digital methods in a subject. The importance
of good project staff and the availability of technical support
also proved vital. If a project as to be well-used it was also
essential that information about it should be disseminated as
widely as possible.

•

Management:

•

Documentation:
•

•
•

Projects should keep documentation and make it available
from the project web site, making clear the extent,
provenance and selection methods of materials for the
resource.
Funding bodies might consider making documentation a
compulsory deliverable of a funded project.
Discussions could be held between relevant stakeholders
and the funding bodies, with the aim of producing an agreed

Page 244

Projects should have access to good technical support,
ideally from a centre of excellence in digital humanities.
Projects should recruit staff who have both subject expertise
and knowledge of digital humanities techniques, then train
them in other specialist techniques as necessary.
Funding bodies might consider requiring universities to
offer more training for graduate students and RAs in digital
humanities techniques.

Sustainability:
•

Even amongst well-used projects, however we found areas that
might be improved, these included organised user testing, the
provision of and easy access to documentation and the lack of
updating and maintenance of many resources.

Recommendations:

Projects should have a clear idea of whom the expected
users might be; consult them as soon as possible and
maintain contact through the project via a dedicated email
list , website feedback or other appropriate method
They should carry out formal user surveys, software and
interface tests and integrate the results into project design.
Applicants for funding should show that they have consulted
documentation of other relevant projects and discuss what
they have learnt from it in their case for support. The results
of such contact could then be included in the final report as
a condition of satisfactory progress.

Ideally projects should maintain and actively update the
interface, content and functionality of the resource, and not
simply archive it with a data archive such as the AHDS.
However this is dependent on a funding model which makes
this possible.

Dissemination:
•
•

Disseminate information about itself widely, both within
its own subject domain and in digital humanities.
Information should be disseminated widely about the
reasons for user testing and its benefits, for example via
AHRC/AHDS workshops. Projects should be encouraged
to collaborate with experts on user behaviour.

his cross-discipline paper considers the use of corpus
linguistics as it applies to a study of dance writing.

Argument/Premise

L

inguists and Computational Linguistic Engineers who
have studied language for special purposes (LSP)
generally agree that the lexicon used by those in a specialist
discipline offers insight into the concepts and ideologies of that
discipline. As Dance is a specialist discipline, it should then
follow that the lexicon of dance writing can demonstrate
aesthetic concepts and theoretical approaches and beliefs
through generalized language patterns detected using KWIC
methods. This research supports that contention in that the
empirical approach (specifically key words in context), when
used against a corpus of 1.4 million words from written dance
texts, does offer a means to develop an ontology of the
discipline of dance. One ontological example supported by the
empirical data is that of both hierarchical and rhizomatic
structures of relationships between participants in the dance
event. Through this example, this paper will demonstrate both
the process and analytical product of using corpus linguistics
methods and models to develop an ontology of Dance.

Analytical Method

D

ue to a dearth of research into dance writing, especially
in the area of corpus linguistics, there were no tested,
dance-specific models on which to base this study. Therefore,
this research contains a variety of methodologies and
approaches in the disciplines of corpus linguistics and dance
analysis. The corpus methodologies are based on the work of
Sinclair (2003), Ahmad (2002), and Biber (1998). Linguistic
analyses based on KWIC (key words in context) such as word
frequencies, collocations, concordances, and POS tagging were
performed on the data generated by computing tools (e.g.
System Quirk, Unitex, CLAWS). Additional methods proposed
by Traboulsi et al (2003) for identifying a local grammar were
used against samples of critical texts (i.e. dance performance
reviews). Finally, through a two-pronged approach, the data
Page 245

Digital Humanities 2007
was analysed using the analytical modes of description,
interpretation, and evaluation proposed for dance by Adshead
et al (1988).
After establishing the written language of Dance as a specialist
language (or language for special purposes) through the
frequency of open class words in the top 100 most frequently
used words, weirdness factors, and Z-scores, the data was
analysed in a variety of ways. For example, for the purposes
of this particular study into ontological relationships between
participants, general concepts were identified by focusing on
those open class words (OCWs) within the top 100 most
frequently used words in a general dance corpus (the Surrey
Dance Corpus, or SDC). Finding that the OCWs included
several conceptual possibilities which appeared at times to cross
conceptual boundaries, it became apparent that a method for
categorisation was required to provide distinctions between the
concepts. Therefore, the analytical model introduced by
Adshead et al (1988) was used for the categorisation. This
model calls for a deconstruction of a dance work via description,
interpretation, and evaluation based upon identifiable
characteristics of the individual work. The identified distinctions
include not only the movement and production components,
but also concepts of form, concepts through which we view a
dance, and concepts particular to a dance. After determining
the conceptual categories, the analysis went beyond the top 100
most frequently used words, and considered the relative
frequencies of the concept words in the subsequent groups of
most frequently used words (top 200, 300, etc.). Word counts
also were performed on personal pronouns and conceptual
metaphor (using Charteris-Black’s method). Finally,
collocations and concordances using the concept words as target
words were generated and analysed.
Each step was repeated using additional corpora: a group of
sub-corpora defined by content of the texts and/or writers’
particular activity within the discipline (e.g. critic, scholar,
choreographer); and a corpus focused on one choreographer
(used as a case study throughout the research).

Conclusion

T

hrough this research into dance writing, Dance can be
shown to be a LSP with a lexicon specific to the
discipline. So, too, have several unexpected patterns been
detected that reflect various concepts and ideologies, one of
which is that of the relationships between and among the
participants in the dance event (e.g. dancer, choreographer,
audience, critic, company). The relational connections are
further supported by a general belief in the collective, as shown
through word counts and concordances. Additional methods
used in dance analysis provide a structure for studying and
further clarifying the empirically generated patterns. The
Page 246

choreographic and analytic concepts in Dance as they are
perceived and expressed through written dance texts
demonstrate not only the importance of these concepts to
specialists in the discipline of Dance, but also the benefit of
using the corpus linguistics approach to studying dance writing.

Description of Project

M

onArch (The Monastic Archaeology Project) is a
collaborative project based on the excavations at the
Abbey of Saint-Jean-des-Vignes in Soissons, France under the
joint directorship of Sheila Bonde (Brown University) and Clark
Maines (Wesleyan University). The monastery at
St.-Jean-des-Vignes remains with us today in two media: in the
physical remains of the abbey and in the textual remains left
behind by its inhabitants. The most significant of the latter are
the community's Customary, which describes the roles and
activities of the abbey's inhabitants over the course of the
religious year, and the Abbey's Obituary, which lists, by month
and day of death, the members of the monastic community and
laics who had provided service or gifts to the monastery, with
a description of their donations.
Two websites have been developed as part of the MonArch
Project. The first was implemented at Wesleyan (<http://
www.wesleyan.edu/monarch/>), and provides thorough
documentation of the excavations, annual field reports, and
inventories of finds. The second, which is the focus of this
paper, is a research effort in its own right, one that explores the
ways in which encoded representations of archaeological data
may be used enhance their use. The often complex
interrelationships among textual, architectural, and
archaeological evidence are difficult to represent and explicate
in traditional formats; the work described here attempts to use

M

onArch has always focused beyond a simple description
of concrete artifacts to a thoroughgoing investigation
and elaboration of a concept: from the outset, the project was
conceived as a multi-disciplinary endeavor that took
monasticism rather than the monastery as its object of study.1
Therefore, to the extent that its digital manifestation is to be a
direct reflection of the project's aims, it too must take as its
focus an abstraction and not a collection of materials.
Such a focus makes designing the digital reflection more
challenging. It cannot be a simple linked, digital collection,
because such an organization would put undue emphasis on
the monastery and its artifacts. And because the site needs to
be built around concepts and questions — about monasticism
and the archaeology of monasticism — the digital project cannot
be conceived or designed without considerable knowledge of
those concepts or an understanding of medieval social,
economic, architectural, and religious history and the role of
archaeology in elucidating it all. It must, in other words, express
the archaeological definition of monasticism Bonde and Maines
are deriving from their work, a definition that is based on the
following factors:
•
•
•
•

•

•

The monastic complex as the physical expression of
spiritual, social, and economic motives;
The functions of the abbey's structures;
The communitas who used these structures and the routine
of their lives;
The economy of the surrounding region — the farms, mills,
priories, parishes, and other holdings that constituted the
abbey's domain;
The place of the abbey (defined as both buildings and
community) in the local, regional, and inter-regional
networks of power and influence;
The way these phenomena changed over time.

The relationship of the texts — both primary and secondary —
to the archaeological data is complex, because the
archaeological material supports and illustrates the texts at the
same time that the texts contextualize the archaeology and
architecture. These two kinds of remains —
the textual
and the physical — become two inter-referential and mutually
reinforcing centers from which the concepts of monasticism
emerge. The research focus of the current digital project is on
designing an infrastructure and and an interactive interface that
simultaneously represent the authors' arguments and allow users
of the site to form their own interpretations.

Considering Use

W

e argue that it is most fruitful to conceive the digital
manifestation of the MonArch project as a reading.
Insofar as its goal is to provide a definition, the resource is
fundamentally rhetorical: it has an argument, and it supports
its claims with evidence drawn from a variety of evidential
sources. That argument, generally stated, entails an
archaeological definition of monasticism, whose refinement is
the ongoing and iterative task of the MonArch project. The task
of the digital resource, therefore, must be unusually subtle: it
must express this archaeological definition through an intricate
blend of textual and material evidence, and it must provide a
way for readers to interact with and question the argument and
its claims.
In fact, insofar as the digital resource is the manifestation of
this argument, the mutually referential presence of both encoded
texts and artefactual simulacra constitutes a claim in itself, a
claim that a 'definition' of monasticism can be manufactured
through a reading of monastic text, monastic space, and
monastic time, and perhaps only in this way. That is to say, the
boundaries established by the site (and here the web site and
the excavation site perhaps begin themselves to lose their
boundaries) determine how monasticism is to be understood.

Research Goals
Our research, then, is focused on establishing a layered set of
models that enable researchers to articulate their understanding
of monasticism and allow scholars (students, readers, users) to
interact with that understanding. Underlying the whole project
is a fundamental data model that represents the characteristics
of the texts, spaces, buildings and artifacts that form the object
of study. Overlaying the data model is another model, that of
the relationships that embody the intellectual connections that
the researchers have made as they work over their materials
and which embody their definition of monasticism. These
connections are the evidence for their claims. At the topmost
layer is a model of user interaction, one consisting of visual
juxtapositions that illustrate the relationships among the
historical evidence and that enable further questioning.
The problem of structuring information in order to enhance
argument is part of a larger problem. One of the major powers
promised by digital resources is the instantiation of the kind of
textuality envisioned by postmodern theorists like Roland
Barthes and Jacques Derrida, among others: the simultaneous
availability of vast amounts of information in a form that makes
the interconnections, both explicit and implicit, traversable.
Yet benightedness is a clear danger: it is all too easy to become
lost: in 'hyperspace,' in the library, in the labyrinth, or in the
Page 248

wood of error. As digital resources grow in size and complexity,
the need for prospects — lookouts, overviews of the textscape
— becomes ever greater. Digital resources must therefore
become responsive: when a reader examines an argument or
claim in a digital publication, the resource should respond to
her, helpfully putting on the virtual desk before her materials
that are relevant to her evolving inquiry. Thus, in loftiest terms,
our goal must be to assist, supplement, and augment a human
agent
's investigation of accumulated cultural knowledge,
a goal congruent with the aims of research over the past
half-century in fields from information retrieval to artificial
intelligence.

An Evaluation of Text
Classification Methods for
Literary Study

genre, emotion, and more. These different types of target
concepts can also be called document properties. Previous study

showed that document properties interact with clustering
methods. Will the various document properties in literary text
classification tasks affect the classification methods? Are the
previous evaluation results still valid for literary text
classification?

This paper describes an empirical evaluation of text
classification methods for literary study. We choose a new kind
of data - the literary documents - to evaluate classification
methods. Because no benchmark data is available in the literary
domain, we select two literary text classification problems the eroticism classification in Dickinson’s poems and the
sentimentalism classification in early American novels - as two
cases for this study. Both problems focus on identifying certain
kinds of emotion - a document property other than topic.

survey study 1 shows that text classification is a typical
scholarly activity in literary study, and automatic text
classification methods can be used in three scenarios. The first
is information organization - a classifier can learn the target
category concepts (e.g. news article about trade, acquisition,
etc.) from the training documents, and then assign new
documents into these predefined categories. The second purpose
is knowledge discovery - a successful classifier can provide
insights to understand a target concept by revealing the
correlations between the features and the concept. The third
purpose is example-based retrieval - a classifier might be able
to learn a concept from a small number of training documents
with the help of semi- supervised learning or active learning
methods, and then retrieve more documents similar to the
training examples from a large collection.

A

Text classification techniques have been well developed in the
past twenty years. With the availability of many text
classification methods, empirical evaluation is important to
provide guidance for method selection in applications. Because
of the sub jectivity in the class concept definition, analytical
evaluation of text classifiers is difficult. Therefore empirical
experiments became the common text classification evaluation
methods.2 The major text classification methods have been
evaluated on topic classification tasks using some benchmark
data sets, such as the Reuters-21578 news collection and the
Usenet newsgroup collection. Some topic classification
evaluation results have been widely accepted. For example,
SVM is currently the best text classifier3; no feature selection
improves SVM performance 4; SVM feature selection is better
than Odds Ratio for naive Bayes, etc.5 There are mixed
conclusions regarding some document preprocessing techniques,
such as stemming and stop word removal.
However, these evaluation data sets were limited to news and
web documents; the evaluation tasks were limited to topic
classification for information organization purpose. The target
concepts in literary text classification range from topic to style,

We also choose two popular text classification algorithms naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and three
feature engineering options - feature merging (stemming),
stopword removal and statistical feature selection (Odds Ratio
and SVM) - as the sub jects of evaluation. We aim to examine
the effects of the chosen classifiers and feature engineering
options on the two emotion classification problems, and the
interaction between the classifiers and the feature engineering
options. As a special case of feature merging, we also examine
the impact of Dickinson’s unconventional capitalizations on
classification performance. We choose bag-of-words (BOW)
model for document representation.
We seek empirical answers to the following research questions:
1. 1. Is SVM a better classifier than naive Bayes regarding
classification accuracy, new literary knowledge discovery
and potential for example-based retrieval?
2. 2. Is SVM a better feature selection method than Odds Ratio
regarding feature reduction rate and clas- sification accuracy
improvement?
3. 3. Does stop word removal affect the classification
performance?
4. 4. Does stemming affect the performance of classifiers and
feature selection methods?
Our experiment results show that SVM is not a universal winner
in literary text classification. After fea- ture reduction naive
Bayes achieves high accuracies in both cases while SVM
succeeds in the sentimentalism classification only. Figure 1
and 2 show that SVM and naive Bayes select their top features
from different frequency ranges. Naive Bayes tends to pick
unique words, which are often not frequent. The large number
of low frequency words results in the success of naive Bayes
in the eroticism classification. These unique words also
surprised the Dickinson scholars, who finally found some new
erotic indicators from them. SVM tends to pick high frequent
Page 249

Digital Humanities 2007
and discriminant words, which are scarce in the Dickinson
collection. These words (such as personal pronouns) are within
the scholars’ expectation and therefore not interesting anymore.

Figure 2: Sentimentality feature ranks and frequencies

Figure 1: Dickinson feature ranks and frequencies

Despite the high classification accuracies, the learned naive
Bayes eroticism classifier, and also the SVM classifier with
low accuracy, are useless for example-based retrieval purpose.
Figure 3 shows that the concept of eroticism can not be learned
from small number of examples, and the classifiers’ prediction
confidence drop quickly with the expanding prediction
coverage.
Both classifiers achieve high classification accuracies in the
sentimentalism classification task, which in- dicate that
sentimentalism is a more straightfoward concept than eroticism
for bag-of-words representation. The two classifiers still choose
different top features but reach comparable performances for
the sentimen- talism classification. So for the purpose of
feature-category correlation analysis the two methods should
be used as complemental to each other rather than one over the
other. This time the unique words picked by naive Bayes are
so strange that the scholars can not make sense of it. The
common but discriminant words picked by SVM are still within
the scholars’ expectation. The learning curves and confidence
curves in figure 4 show that both classifiers yield high potential
for example-based retrieval.

Page 250

Digital Humanities 2007
The experiment results also show that self feature selection
helps both naive Bayes and SVM improve classification
accuracies. For SVM the improvement is not as significant as
for naive Bayes. Odds Ratio is better than SVM as feature
selection method for naive Bayes. However Odds Ratio cannot
improve the SVM performance. Without feature selection the
stemmed and unstemmed features obtain similarly low
classification accuracies in both cases, so did the case merging
in the Dickinson case. The micro level analysis finds that the
effects of good mergings and bad mergings are neutralized
overall. Stemming does not affect both feature selection
methods in the eroticism classification case, but we are surprised
to find that stemming negatively affects both feature selection
methods, especially SVM, in the sentimentalism classification
case.
We have found that the stop words obtained from the Brown
corpus are also overly common and useless in sentimentalism
classification. However, the Brown stop words are mostly
uncommon in the Dickinson collection. Personal pronouns the group of function words usually treated as stop words turns out to be highly relevant features for eroticism
classification.
Our study extends the empirical evaluation of text classification
methods to emotion classification tasks in the literary domain.
Some conclusions are consistent with what are obtained in
previous research, such as Odds Ratio does not improve SVM
performance and stop word removal might harm classification.
Some conclusions contradict previous results, such as SVM
does not beat naive Bayes in both cases. Some findings are new
to this area - SVM and naive Bayes select top features in
different frequency ranges; stemming might harm feature
selection methods. These experiment results provide new
insights to the relation between classification methods, feature
engineering options and non-topic document properties.

Our experiment results also provide guidance for classification
method selection in literary text classifi- cation applications.
We suggest that both SVM and naive Bayes be used for
feature-category correlation analysis purpose. The number of
support vectors in the SVM model indicates the complexity of
the target concept. A complex concept is hard to learn from
small training set. Feature reduction produces smaller and more
generalizable models, but statistical methods are a better choice
than the arbitrary feature reduction (like stemming and stop
word removal) which are insensitive to particular classification
tasks.

RolandHT and Reconceiving the
Notion of Corpus
Vika Zafrin (vika@wordsend.org)
Brown University

RolandHT

F

or the past several years I have been pursuing the study
of a semi-fictional character's manifestations in different
art forms, throughout Europe and North America, in the last
thousand years. Roland is the protagonist of the French epic
Song of Roland and France's national hero. He first appeared
in written record at the end of the eleventh century, and hasn't
left us since then – although his character has undergone
significant changes. He has easily passed from one culture to
another; but Roland is not merely borrowed – he is mercurial.
He has been used by writers and artists as a container for the
promotion of moral and political exigencies relevant to their
circumstances. Thus, in France he is a staunch protector of the
Christian faith (Song of Roland); in Germany, a religious martyr
(Konrad); in Italy, a lover and a comedic character (Boiardo,
Ariosto); in England, a mystical traveler (Browning); in the
United States, a roadie (Silverstein) and a gunslinger (King).
Nevertheless, the French Roland has easily identifiable
personality traits, such as his infamous pride (which cost him
and twenty thousand of Charlemagne's best men their lives)
and his physical prowess. There are also artifacts, such as his
enchanted sword and his sounding horn that can be heard for
miles. These features have prompted me to make a case for the
existence of a Roland corpus that is held together by recurrent
themes and imagery. In my dissertation titled RolandHTI show
these recurrences by encoding them in XML.1 This corpus has
never been considered as a whole. An examination of themes
recurrent in it offers insight into the evolution of art and the
pace of intercultural transmission. This insight is relevant to
the study of literature at the dawn of Western secular writing;
but it also sheds light on our own literary present, in an age of
widely accessible electronic writing, when the processes of
composition and transmission are changing again.
The Roland corpus consists of works in such diverse media as
literature, live and puppet theater, opera, sculpture and stone
carvings, painting, film, contemporary music, and comics. This
presents a problem in my use of the word corpus, which
conforms to its theoretical definition but not to any of its prior
use in practice. I propose that the electronic medium, and

semantic encoding in particular, allow for the study of corpora
bound not by format or authorship, but by semantic content.
RolandHT is a collection of excerpts from works that feature
Roland, encoded for recurring characters, imagery and themes.
Some annotations are present. Works span most of Europe and
the United States, and date from between the late 1090s to 1995.
Most of the corpus objects are text-based – poems, prose, drama,
operatic lyrics. One particularly interesting corpus object –
Greg Roach's computer game The Madness of Roland – is a
blend of text and images. Other image-based corpus objects
include comic-book panels and photographs of medieval
stonework found in France and Croatia. Included are also
excerpts from the 1999 film Beowulf, in QuickTime (.mov)
format. Other objects will be added as time and copyright
restrictions allow.

Technical Details

T

he project is processed for web presentation using XSLT,
JavaScript and CSS. The website is a technical
collaboration with Ethan Fremen.
Our approach is standards- and client-based. All features except
bookmarking can be used with static files accessed locally. This
permits RolandHT to be archived on a CD, DVD or other
storage device; access to a networked server is not necessary
to view the work. This is an advantage for the purposes of
submitting a doctoral thesis, but being entirely client-side, our
method would not scale well: a substantially larger corpus will
require an XML database in order to remain efficient. As it
stands, the roughly 800KB XML file containing all text data
(but not the separately-stored images or multimedia files) must
be loaded entirely before the project is viewed, rendering it
unwieldy for slow connections if RolandHT is accessed over
the web. However, once it is loaded, subsequent operations are
performed client-side and connection speed no longer matters,
except when fetching the aforementioned images and
multimedia files.

The notion of corpus

T

he notion of corpus is used in the study of languages
(corpus linguistics), literature, and objects (architecture,
archaeology). Definitions of _corpus_ provided by several
different dictionaries of English and of literary terms are
variations of "a related 'body' of writings, usually sharing the
same author or subject-matter." (Baldick 52) It is almost never
further defined in the context of specific studies. Instead, corpus
is taken for granted, and is found far more often in headings
than in discussion. When it is used in the text itself, the set of
objects under consideration invariably has an author, time period
Page 253

Digital Humanities 2007
and/or geographical area in common. None of these things can
usefully delimit the Roland corpus. However, some past uses
of corpus would justify the use of the word to describe works
about Roland.

be the opposite of a static collection of unchanging documents;
its primary-source contents, encoding and annotations are all
meant to change as research progresses.

Most often the contested word is used in corpus linguistics.
One book in particular defines corpus as "a subset of an ETL
[electronic text library], built according to explicit design
criteria for a specific purpose." (Ghadessy et al. 179) This is
the only non-dictionary definition I have found, and if we
substitute "Western artistic production" for "ETL," it becomes
relevant to the construction of RolandHT. The purpose of
defining it is to shed light on how its protagonist has survived
so unusually long while at the same time undergoing
fundamental changes. However, the subjective nature of the
definition process demands a willingness to alter design criteria
as texts are encoded, and a leap of faith that scholars may be
reluctant to make. Working with a semantically encoded body
of work requires acceptance of XML as a valid format for
making a scholarly argument. This in turn calls for critical
responses that are also at least partly expressed in XML. ("I
disagree with this encoding. How about this alternative
instead?")

Summary

Roland is a flexible corpus that emerges and evolves in the
course of its analysis. Its unifying subject may be a default
connecting thread by virtue of Roland's name, but since the
actual connecting threads are recurrent themes and imagery,
the way to ascertain a work's status as a corpus object (or not)
is a close reading of it. In this case, micro-results of the close
reading are recorded by XML encoding.
The above describes a practical application of Gregory Ulmer's
theory of heuretics. In his 1994 Heuretics: The Logic of
Invention, Ulmer states that theory is assimilated into the
humanities in two principal ways: by critical interpretation and
by artistic experiment. Heuretics is the latter – it is a heuristic
approach to theory, a reading process that, instead of attempting
to theorize "what might be the meaning of an existing work,"
guides "a generative experiment: Based on a given theory, how
might another text be composed?" (5)
Why not use words that have been used more frequently to
describe Roland, such as myth or legend? Both of these terms
imply homogeneity that the corpus does not possess, and deny
Roland's historicity, however tenuous. Similarly, the terms
closest to corpus – oeuvre and canon – are limiting to the point
of inaccuracy: the Roland corpus has too many authors to be
called oeuvre and too little institutionalized authority to be a
canon.
Finally, RolandHT is not an archive. It does not strive for
completeness, either within single works (only excerpts are
presented) or within the corpus (which is, to date, representative
but incomplete). More importantly, RolandHT is intended to

f semantic encoding is to be taken seriously as a research
tool by philologists, art historians and other humanists used
to working in more traditional ways, a common language must
first be built and justified. At Digital Humanities 2007 I hope
to contribute to the effort of expanding the inflluence of digital
research methods into mainstream humanities. I will do this by
expanding the notion of corpus to include bodies of works that,
because of their disparate formats, do not lend themselves to
formal study using traditional methods.

Применение технологий TEI и
OAI в
информационно-аналитической
системе «Манускрипт»

Ижевск, Россия

В

настоящее время по крайней мере несколько сотен
древнейших славянских письменных памятников
XI-XIV вв., имеющих большую научную, культурную,
историческую ценность, недоступны широкому кругу
исследователей разных специальностей и всем, кто
интересуется русской историей и культурой. Причины
просты: большая часть рукописей еще не издана, а если и
есть издание, то оно является раритетом и работа с ним
возможна только в крупных центральных библиотеках.
Работа же непосредственно с рукописью часто осложняется
удаленностью места работу исследователя от места
хранения памятника. Но даже издание памятника в ряде
случаев требует постоянного обращения к оригиналу, если
дело касается его палеографии, оформления и других
аналогичных вопросов. Кроме того, в существующих
печатных изданиях, к сожалению, часто отсутствуют
необходимые для знакомства с текстом и для его
исследования справочные материалы, а сами рукописи
изданы со значительным упрощением оригинала. Выходом
из существующей ситуации недоступности письменных
памятников древности и средневековья для научной,
учебной и популяризаторской деятельности является
создание электронных публикаций, которые способны не
только заменить печатные издания, но и во многом
перевести работу с ними на функционально иной уровень:
(а) предоставить постоянный доступ к электронным копиям
рукописей и к справочным материалом через интернет, (b)
предоставить пользователю возможность выборки данных
на основе многофункциональных справочных интерфейсов
как на уровне мета- и аналитических данных, так и на
уровне собственно грамматических, семантических,
тематических характеристик текстов, (c) дать возможность
коллективной работы над изучением памятника.

О

дним из примеров информационной системы,
предназначенной для решения части указанных
Page 255

Digital Humanities 2007
проблем, является информационно-аналитическая система
«Манускрипт» (ИАС «Манускрипт»)
ИАС «Манускрипт» ориентирована на ввод, хранение,
автоматизированную обработку, исследование и издание
древних текстов, имеющих идентичные оригиналу
графико-орфографический вид и структуру. В настоящее
время ИАС «Манускрипт» уже содержит несколько
десятков уникальных древних и средневековых славянских
текстов.
В настоящее время ИАС «Манускрипт» состоит из
нескольких
разнофункциональных
модулей,
взаимодействующих с единой базой данных, в которой
хранятся иерархически структурированные данные:
•
•
•
•
•

специализированный редактор,
модуль запросов и выборок,
модуль электронных изданий,
модуль лингвистических словарей,
модуль выгрузки текстов и справочных материалов для
печатных публикаций.

Основной задачей коллектива авторов и разработчиков на
данном этапе развития системы является предоставление
накопленной информации для анализа и изучения
широкому кругу исследователей. Основной путь – создание
специализированных модулей, предназначенных для и
функционально разнообразного, дружественного и
понятного манипулирования данными. Второй задачей
является создание средств обмена мета-, аналитическими
и текстовыми данными между коллективами, которые
создают аналогичные по материалу коллекции, с целью
предоставления пользователям возможностей использовать
для анализа рукописей и текстов инструментальные
средства работы с древними документами, созданные
различными коллективами.
Для обеспечения максимально широкого доступа
различными инструментальными средствами к накопленной
в
ИАС
информации
необходимо
использовать
стандартизованные форматы и средства обмена данными.

метаинформации в формате Dublin Core разрабатывается
отдельный модуль системы. Данный модуль позволит
собирать метаинформацию не только по самим текстам,
но и по их фрагментам (различные элементы иерархий).
Найденный уникальный идентификатор средствами
интерфейса OAI возможно использовать для получения
метаинформации или полного текста из системы
«Манускрипт» в формате XML-TEI.
Сегодня рекомендации консорциума TEI являются
общепризнанными в мире. Поэтому вполне логичным стало
решение разработчиков ИАС «Манускрипт» использовать
именно этот инструмент для описания метаинформации и
полных документов для обмена данными.
ИАС «Манускрипт» использует сетевую модель данных
для описания объектов (единиц) рукописей и связей между
ними, поэтому при создании записей в формате XML-TEI
основной проблемой стали структурные ограничения,
накладываемые стандартами XML: структура XML
документа, которым является документ в формате
XML-TEI, должна быть строго иерархической. Следствием
этого, например, является невозможность получить всю
информацию о тексте (имеющуюся в системе
«Манускрипт») в виде одного документа.
Для реализации интегрирования технологий ИАС
«Манускрипт» с технологиями TEI разрабатываются два
модуля.
Модуль хранения и обработки мета- и аналитических
данных предназначен для работы с археографическими,
текстологическими и иными сведениями о самих
рукописях, текстах и их фрагментах, а также для
формирования запросов и выборок на основе этих сведений.
Средствами этого модуля поиск возможен только по метаи аналитическим данным.
Запросы пользователей на получение определенных
элементов текста в формате XML-TEI из системы
«Манускрипт» обрабатывает специальный модуль.
Основные возможности данного модуля:
•

В

качестве основы для решения этой задачи решено
использовать технологии Open Archive Initiative (OAI)
и Text Encoding Initiative (TEI):
•
•

OAI – для индексации существующих текстов и их
фрагментов;
TEI – для предоставления мета и аналитической
информации, а также самих текстов.

В настоящее время ведутся работы по включению ИАС
«Манускрипт» в состав открытого сообщества OAI в
качестве
Data
Provider.
Для
предоставления
Page 256

•

получение любого элемента текста в формате XML-TEI,
описанного в ИАС «Манускрипт» в качестве
самостоятельной единицы;
расстановка приоритетов по созданию документов
XML-TEI. Данная опция необходима ввиду
накладываемых ограничений на структуру XML
документа. Пользователь сам может выбирать, какая
структура для него является приоритетной, а какая –
менее приоритетной. Иначе говоря, при создании
документа максимально отображается приоритетная
структура, внутри нее отображается следующая по
приоритету и т.д.;

Digital Humanities 2007
•
•

получение мета и аналитической информации как
вместе с полным текстом, так и отдельно;
запрашиваемый документ собирается в момент запроса,
поэтому любое изменение в тексте тут же будет
использовано.

И

АС «Манускрипт» постоянно развивается, и вместе
с ней модернизируются указанные инструменты.

Во время доклада будет продемонстрирована работа ИАС
«Манускрипт», описанных модулей и технологий.
